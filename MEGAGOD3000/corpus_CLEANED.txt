all of arising apparent self and world and universe is itself a of fire yielding only and at last to an indivisible uniformity of inert time and to explosion of
all of arising apparent self and world and universe is cosmic fault of all it seems upon a broken space of light
all of arising apparent self and world and universe is a suffered happening always present as divorce from all the what it reality itself be happened stead of happen and its pain of
only what is perfect shines as bright as perfect is
therefore why go seeking for the only what is real is smallest hind at every breath before a self or world or universe is seemed to suffer life and light at any the arising apparent world is a context of differences separateness change timed cessation untimely ending timeless always repetitions
the arising apparent universe will apparently expand indefinitely into a gray it inherently and paradoxically always coincides with the seed and characteristic of merely repetition or of perpetual same as was and same as same and same as merely seeming seems
the arising apparent individual or embodied self or entity is inherently from the arising apparent therefore the arising apparent individual or embodied point of view is a context exactly in the mode of the arising apparent world
the arising apparent individual or or embodied point of view like the arising apparent universe inevitably changes toward and into death while also paradoxically it always repeats itself and thus perpetually as it was and same and seeming as it seems and seeming same as merely seeming seems to seem
the tacit and direct or always prior of the inherently transcendental spiritual and divine and of reality itself is the intrinsic at perfect last the absolute and transcendental spiritual the or arising apparent and the totality of arising apparent world and universe
the revealed and given seventh way or inherently perfect of is the way of tacit and direct or always prior of the inherently transcendental spiritual and divine and of reality the way of the intrinsic transcending and at perfect last the absolute and transcendental spiritual of arising apparent self and world and universe
nevertheless the revealed and given seventh way or inherently perfect of is not a path of seeking to cause separation from arising apparent self and world and universe as an effect of any kind of strategic effort or the revealed and given seventh way or inherently perfect of intrinsically inherent transcending of or arising apparent separate self at and from the beginning
at perfect any to cause or by or means to achieve separation from the totality of arising apparent world and revealed and given seventh way or inherently perfect of inevitably and perfectly as the perfect and the absolute or divine translation of the arising apparent or embodied and the totality of arising apparent world and universe
at perfect last the revealed and given seventh way or inherently perfect of perfectly the absolute or divine translation of arising apparent self and world and universe in and as the one and indivisible conscious light that is inherently perfectly transcendental spiritual only and divine reality itself
the intrinsic fault of or of bondage to embodied point of view is or and and objectification of self other thing world and universe
the intrinsic fault of all seeking to cure the intrinsic fault of or bondage to embodied point of view is or and and discrimination between presumed self and presumed
the revealed and given seventh way or inherently perfect of always already inherently and perfectly transcends and inherently perfectly both the intrinsic fault of or bondage to embodied point of view and the intrinsic fault of all seeking to cure the intrinsic fault of or bondage to embodied point of view
the revealed and given seventh way or inherently perfect of is the way of perfect
i am the divine gift of the bright and of the thumbs that reveals it a selection from the of his divine presence the perfect tradition i am the divine gift of the bright and of the thumbs that reveals it by his divine presence i am the divine gift of the bright and of the thumbs that reveals it as an infant child i was the bright form of conscious light that knew and
even as a young boy and in the teenage too the thumbs would always to show me the bright again
however in my final approach to early adult life the bright had most often seemed to disappear into the human darkness
and i seemed to have no apparent ready means to enjoy it
and even the thumbs grew scarce
i had spent years devoted to forceful seeking for some image some object some reason or some idea the effect of which would be absolutely liberating and
my seeking had been motivated by the loss of fundamental faith the apparent loss of the reasons for joy
then in a sudden great moment of perfect i knew the truth was not a matter of seeking
thus i knew there are no reasons for joy and freedom
it is not a matter of a truth an object a concept a belief a reason a motivation or any otherwise external fact
indeed it became clear to me that all such objects are grasped in a state that is already seeking and which has already lost the intrinsic prior and inherently perfect of absolutely reality itself beyond all of that i saw that the truth or reality itself is a matter of the absence of all every trace of conflict opposition division or desperate motivation within
where there is no seeking no contradiction there is only the inherent knowledge and power that is reality itself
this was the first aspect of my sudden clarity
in this free state beyond all contradiction i also saw that freedom and joy is not attained that it is not dependent on any condition form object idea progress or experience
i saw that human indeed all at any moment always and already free
i knew that even in any moment i was not lacking anything i needed yet to had i ever been without any such a thing
the problem was the seeking created and enforced contradiction conflict and absence within
then the intrinsic indivisible i am always already free
this was the second aspect of that fundamental
that sudden and truly and intrinsic perfect of the of reality itself was and is the of all this i knew to be inherently perfect truth
previously i had been striving for some objective truth in order to replace the emptiness associated with my natural fall into that replacement was a mere wouldbe of fullness and freedom
however i now and suddenly had that this striving was itself the source of contradiction in me
now i knew there is no entity of truth
i knew that perfect freedom is always already the case
freedom in the living when freedom is created or sought but where there is this fundamental radical and inherently perfect and divine
in that great moment of inherently perfect of the one and indivisible conscious light i turned out of the entire context of my of separateness and seeking
from then i was perfectly to the mature realization of the bright
it was the of my divine in this at last in the great event of my divine on the one being that is my own ultimate was revealed most perfectly
the one being who i am was revealed to include the reality that is consciousness itself the reality that is the of all conditional appearances and the reality that is all conditional as a single force of being an eternal indivisibility and an irreducible cosmic then there was no event of changes no movement at all
there was not even any kind of inward inwardness at all
there was no meditation
there was no need for meditation
there was not a single element or change that could be added to make my state complete
i am complete i sat in my first room with my eyes open
i was not having an experience of any kind
then suddenly i understood most perfectly
i realized that i had realized
the thing about the bright became obvious
i am complete
i am the one who is complete
i radically understood the root and branch of
the i of heart itself inherently and most perfectly and who i am
it was a tacit realization a direct knowledge in consciousness
it was conscious light itself without the addition of a communication from any other source
there is no other source
i simply sat knew what and who i am
i was being what i am who i am
i am being what i am who i am
i am reality the divine nature substance support and of all things and all beings
i am one
one and only
i am the one being otherwise named and by many names
i am the source and substance and support and of
i am the consciousness and energy in and as which appears
i am the and reality itself
i am the one and only and indivisible reality is not ego but which is the inherently and perfectly reality and truth prior to all dualities but excluding none
i am the one and only and inherently and divine condition nature substance support and ground of
i am the bright
the thumbs is my of my own divine state
there was no thought involved in this
i am that and and divine conscious light
there was no reaction of either excitement or surprise
i am the one i recognized reality to be
i am that one
i am not merely experiencing that one
i am the bright
then truly there was no more to realize
every experience in my life had led to this
all my happen of was the instant of this same reality i am
my entire life had been the communication of that reality to i am that
even from the instant of my birth the inherent and most perfect knowledge was as am simply the spiritually conscious light that is reality
i am identified with no body no function of body or mind no conditional world and no conditional i am the inherently perfect absolute
i saw there is nothing of conditional possibility to which my can be compared or from which it can be differentiated or by which it can be epitomized
it does not stand out
it is not the equivalent of any specialized exclusive or separate state
it can not be accomplished acquired discovered remembered or it is inherently perfect and it is always already the case
all remedial paths pursue some special conditional state or achieved goal as spiritual truth
but in fact reality is not identical to such things
they only amount to an identification with some body some functional condition some conditional dimension of appearances or some conditional or otherwise achieved or low subtle or gross
but the knowledge that is reality is consciousness itself
consciousness itself is not separate from anything
it is always already the no conditional experience no conditional realm and no body or function is the necessary condition for its realization
only radical most perfectly is the realization of what and who is always already the case
only radical most perfectly is the and not at all achieved or maintained realization of the inherently and inherently that always already is what and who is
therefore only the way of radical is the true and radical way of the very and ultimate truly and ultimately most perfectly and
all other religious and spiritual endeavors are paths made of mere effort rather than and truly practice
and all paths of seeking merely pursue that which is real god or truth itself or reality this by identifying god or truth or reality with some body or some function or some conditional dimension of experiential possibility or some conditional experience in and of itself
i am the divine gift of the bright and of the thumbs that reveals it by his divine presence unlike the way of radical or the radical way of the very and ultimate heart which is based upon the and the always most direct transcending of the motive and the activity of seeking all remedial paths seek either the perfection of what is existing or liberation from what is existing
and that perfection or liberation that is sought is always pursued by conditional and experiential means
and by all the means of great seeking reality itself is pursued as a mere goal which goal is merely a conditional and dependent event or thing or state mistakenly presumed to be identical to god or truth or reality itself
only the way of radical or the radical way of the very and ultimate heart is always already free of all conditional or otherwise to be achieved goals
only the way of radical or the radical way of the very and ultimate heart is inherently free of the itself
indeed only the very and ultimate and inherently heart itself is inherently free of all and of even all seeking
and only the intrinsically way of radical is the radical way of the very and ultimate and inherently heart itself
when tacit and inherently most perfect of the intrinsically that is real god and truth itself and reality itself was finally as me there was no excitement no surprise no movement no response
there was a most perfect end to every kind of seeking dilemma suffering separation and doubt
spiritual life mental life emotional and psychic life vital life and physical life all became transparent in me
after that there was only the spiritually to be the spiritually reality to all beings and all things
in all the days that have followed the great event of my divine there has not been so much as a single change or even so much as a single sign of in this state of me
indeed this state of divine can not be changed diminished or lost
in and after the great event i noticed that all conditional and experience had ceased to affect me
whatever it a physical sensation some quality of emotion a thought a vision or did not at all involve me as i am
i began to pay particular attention to what passed in order to test my simply in order to account for all aspects of my state in the total functional context of the living
but the always primary of the inherently and spiritually reality my very consciousness itself could not be changed diminished or lost
consciousness one and only and inherently indivisible and perfectly conscious the only thing in life that is not a apparent something arising objectively as something known or some kind of knowledge of the known arising as apparent thing to the only perfect which is inherently mindless and consciousness itself
consciousness the and conscious light not depend on anything and there is not nor can there be any thing or any experience that can destroy consciousness or the one and only and inherently indivisible i am the divine gift of the bright and of the thumbs that reveals it by his divine presence conscious light itself
consciousness and conscious light itself joy freedom and perfect knowledge an entirely new and most perfect realization of reality had become the constant of my life
the perpetual revolutions of my life had drawn me by the thumbs into a sense of the perfect presence
there was simply the sense of being in and of the spiritual presence that was both truth itself and reality itself
it was a perfectly absorbing heartening and illuminating force that contained me lived me and guided me
eventually this spiritual presence communicated itself in me and to me perfectly revealing itself as me
thus and thereby i was to the truth of my inherent and inherently most perfect with the spiritually and that is the divine itself
and this bright and showed itself to be my eternal always already before my until then my life beyond childhood had been a constant search toward the bright as a presence with which i was in relationship
it was as if i always saw the bright from some position within the apparent form of my own living outside of its perfect
it was as if i was constantly my own heart from some position outside
but now the apparent barriers had been utterly dissolved by a most perfect and and inherently of the of that presence
the ever more spiritually absorbed investigation of the presence had resolved into the perfect of my own
the presence had revealed itself to be my own and very form and
the experience of the presence was by means of the most perfect of radical replaced by the most perfect of spiritually bright as conscious light
there was no longer any presence outside me
i no longer observed my own or the ultimate and inherently spiritual of reality itself as if from some position external to and separate from it
i had become perfectly of myself as reality itself
there was no presence no other
i myself had become perfectly
there is no other
it is only me
even my meditation of spiritual absorption was changed
indeed there was no meditation
this conscious could not be deepened
nor could it be enlarged
it always only remained what it is
immediately i realized that i was not in any sense in a only a physical body but any body or any function or even any subtle function form or state
nor have i ever been in a body or in any function or in any condition or in any conditional state or experience
all such things are merely apparent and not at all necessary or inevitable patterns manifested within the of my own
nevertheless i realized that in the context of natural appearances i am principally at the root of a specific center in the body
relative to the body i appear to reside in immediate association with the at the left and not in the middle but to the right side of the chest
i press upon a point approximately two inches to the right of the center of the i am the divine gift of the bright and of the thumbs that reveals it by his divine presence chest
this is the seat of reality and real consciousness
and i there as
there is no motivation no dilemma no separation no strategic action no suffering
i am in and perfectly prior to the heart
the zero of the heart is expanded as the world
consciousness is not differentiated and identified
there is a constant observation of subject and object in any body any function any realm or any experience that arises
thus i as the state
there is a constant sensation of spiritually fullness and surrounding all experiences all things all bodies all functions of body and mind
it is my own fullness which is inherently
my own fullness includes all beings and all things
i am the form of space which all bodies all functions all things and all arising experiences occur
it is inherently spiritually conscious light itself
that inherently spiritually conscious light is even every beings very nature and ultimate inherent and inherently perfect and now and now
during the night of i spontaneously as perfect absolute limitless indivisible which every function state and sign of body and mind boiled into a solder of and reality
it is the madness of dissolution into most perfect infinitely as my own inherently boundless there is only brightness not limited by conditional identity or by separate and self or by any desire
hereafter i am inherently free of bondage to the cosmic power
i am
the energy that appears apart as any form of apparently independent merely cosmic power and no longer the great importance
the presence of power outside appears to be such only to they having already separated themselves pursue forms of energy visions conditional liberation and
perfect knowledge is free of all bondage to forms to all apparent modifications of energy to all seeking and to all motivations to do or to act on the basis of identification with conditional experience
ignorance and suffering are simply the of separateness the of difference the of search
at last the outside energy sacrifices itself in the very and ultimate heart
thereafter there is no gnawing wonder no unknown secret about anything that appears
the time of the great event of my divine forever passes into the present and the future
immediately previous to the great event of my divine i was always involved in one or another form of the problem of conditional existence
i was always in search and all my conclusions and insights were only temporary moments that only led into a new form of investigation
thus i was exiled from the bright of childhood by the dilemma of my youth
in time i went from the cosmic revelations of the presence and the subjective drama of mystical vision to the perfect of the inherently perfect divine that is reality that is perfect knowledge itself
now there are no loose ends to my adventure
there is no dilemma no motivation no search
all the parts of the mind have been transposed and dissolved in a most fundamental and indivisible singleness
nevertheless i continue to live in this meantime of my purpose here
the external and internal events of the merely natural life were not themselves merely disappeared by this perfect realization
it is only that i understand the in a most profoundly radical and perfect i understand most perfect knowledge is the foundation of my living existence the sake of everyone
i am the one who would awaken you a selection from the of his divine presence i am the one who would awaken you by his divine presence the usual person thinks this body and its psyche are dying
this world is dying
everyone is suffering
everyone is seeking
there is mortality
there is frustration and limitation
but none of that is truth
those interpretations are not truth
the world itself is not is life nor psyche and body nor death nor experience
no event is in and of itself truth
everything that arises is an appearance to consciousness itself a modification of the divine conscious light that is always already the case
all of this is a dream if you like
it is an appearance in consciousness itself
truth is very consciousness itself
truth is to all of this what the waking state is to the dreaming state
if you awaken you do not have to do anything about the condition you may have suffered or enjoyed in the dream state
what happened within the dream is suddenly not your present condition
it is of no consequence any longer once you are awake
if you persist in dreaming and your point of view remains that of the dreamer and the role within the dream then your possible actions are
but none of them will work
they will simply occupy you in the dream
they will modify the dream state but no action in the dream is the equivalent of waking
there are simply forms of fascination of occupation of you wake up
truth is simply waking
it is not a condition within this appearance
it has nothing whatsoever to do with the mind regardless of whether the mind is expanded or contracted
there is one who is wide awake while he appears in the dream
by not supporting the dream he awakens others
he is the true divine guru
i am that one
the significance of my work is not in anything i do within the dream
i simply do not support it
i do not live as it
i do not believe it
i do not take it seriously
apparently i can feel and act as i please within the dream
i persist in the common or ordinary manner
but i do not support the dream
i do not live from its point of view
i do not live its structure to others
i do not live the to avoidance of relationship the
simply because i live in this manner those who are related to me tend to become awake
but while they are awakening they persist in dreaming to various degrees
forms of the dream persist
the search persists
often they get a little distance from the seems to break up at times seems to disappear
it becomes vague it becomes uninteresting it becomes it becomes serious again
you are just beginning to awaken
with me is the dream in which i appear
now it is as if you are beginning to wake up in your room
you are in bed and it is morning
there are a few things you begin to notice which indicate that you are in another state
those who are awakening in truth begin to notice something
they begin to recognize the signs
they begin to recognize the activity of dreaming
they begin to sense something very unusual about me
before their actual awakening i appear as all kinds of things to them
i suggest all kinds of fantastic things
all the things they can imagine while they dream everything unbelievable is what they think i am
i may appear to be extraordinary a of famous things
i may appear as that
but i am simply awake
not a single thing is happening
not a single thing has been accomplished
i am only awake
i am like the sunlight in the morning
i intensify the light of morning until you awaken
until the light awakens you even the light of consciousness itself you continue to dream try to survive within the dream manipulate yourself within the dream pursue all kinds of goals of which awaken you
the ordinary means only you and distract you within the dream
i myself the one who would awaken you am not a person not an individual within the dream
i am your very consciousness
i am reality itself the divine conscious light the true waking state the true divine heartbreaking through the force of dreaming
it is not that you are some poor person who needs some other poor person to help you out
it may appear to be so within the in reality i am your own true appearing within the dream to awaken you
i am your awakening and your always already conscious state
even while dreaming you may experience suggestions of waking
you may become momentarily aware of the body momentarily aware of lying in bed
for a moment the images of the dream may stop
likewise i myself appearing within the world am truly your real conscious state
my person in the world is like an image in a dream
but in fact i am more like your moments of wakening moments that move you into the waking state
i am not some separateness some individual
i am consciousness itself reality itself truth itself
in with me the truth is lived to you then live the truth as your condition
gradually you become less and less involved with the images of yourself
you become less concerned with the usual process of your life
you are doing less and less about it
you are trying less and less to get free to get realized to get to god liberation and pleasant sensation
you are not trying to stop engaging all of that effort
it just begins to wear down while you live the conditions given by me
you simply notice this
you cease to be occupied with your the truth is being lived to you
the truth is being lived as yourself by means of my divine grace
that realization which does not support separation and seeking is the ground of radical
in with me that realization replaces the ordinary operating basis of your life
you simply forget your adventure of is all
the power of with me you from mere suffering or the separate and and always seeking truth itself becomes obvious
therefore truth is not a matter of doing something to the ego the the identification with the body or anything else
rather truth is simply to be truth all that is not truth
i live the divine force and generate the conditions of spiritual life in relationship to my
over time more and more responsibility is given to my the course of deepening devotion to me and increasing and or real
the process of the with me is a divine gift given by mea gift that is progressively more and more profound
i have talked about the relationship between guru and as the essence the fundamental condition of spiritual practice
but the relationship is not a form of concentration on the guru as a separate and merely symbolic entity
that is not relationship
that is your own fabrication your own suffering again
whenever there is relationship there is no need for all of these symbolic
the true nature of spiritual practice in my divine is to live the condition and the of with me of relationship to me in my function as true divine guru
within the dream the potential images may be consoling and even such consolation or hope is not the equivalent of being awake
consolation and hope depend upon your being asleep
the forms of seeking exploit your capability to identify with the fundamental dilemma of dreaming which is its
the forms of seeking may satisfy you within the context of your presumptions but they are not the equivalent of waking up
what is required to wake up what can you do within the dream to wake up not a thing
there is only the waking itself
all actions within the dream are forms of the dream itself
waking is another it occurs by other means by divinely graceful means
i am not a symbol a condition of the dream itself
no mere symbol no mere condition of the dream can wake you up
i am the divine conscious light the real divine person always already awake functioning alive
i appear in bodily human form within the dream of in order to you but to awaken you through the real crisis in consciousness
i am a frustration to the unconscious condition of the dream
i am the man of radical understanding
in my function as the true divine guru i am the divine
i am the person of reality itself
i am always already awake
i could not care less about your urges and demands within the dream
i refuse to satisfy them
i refuse to give you an experience merely to you
i have no intention of satisfying game
all the demands for satisfaction that you bring are frustrated in my company
what is satisfied what is made to grow is that fundamental intuition of reality that is already the foundation of your existence
that intuition is intensified in with me
all the rest the fascinated search begins to fall away
in with me the search begins to reveal itself until it becomes obvious
only the seeker takes the dilemma seriously
the waking state does not take your dreams seriously
it is not the least concerned with your dreams
and fortunately all beings are already alive with the intuition of reality
therefore all beings have an affinity with sunlight with the true waking me
unqualified reality the of my bright divine is what they are already that is what is consciously discovered in the to me
because you always already in my i draw you to myself
it is the intuition of reality itself that inexorably draws people to me that leads them to maintain themselves in my divine
all apparent reasons for holding on to me fall away and also all the apparent reasons for not holding on to me
none of these reasons has any ultimate significance
it is your inherent affinity for truth your intuition of the divine of the living divine heart itself that is entirely responsible for the practice in my divine
when you become less concerned with your particular search your inwardness your adventure then you have simply become more sensitive to your real condition
you have felt the sunlight falling on your sleeping eyes
when your eyes have opened in the morning light everything will be obvious to you will know that you have never slept that you have never dreamed that you have never been limited to any thing that has appeared
you have never been limited to any condition that you have presumed
there was always only reality itself the true divine of is itself consciousness itself the unqualified presence of reality itself truth itself and real in nineteen an investigation was undertaken to determine the dynamic principle of existence in a workable form which might lead to the resolution of some of the problems of mankind
a long research in ancient and modern philosophy culminated in nineteen in the discovered primary law
a work was written at that time which embraced man and his activities
in the following years further research was undertaken in order to prove or disprove the axioms so established
certain experiences during the war made it necessary for the writer to resolve the work into applicable equations and an intensive program was begun in nineteen toward this a year later many techniques had been discovered or evolved and a nebulous form of the present work was formulated
financed chiefly by a lump sum disability compensation that form of was intensively applied to volunteer subjects and the work gradually developed to its present form
has been under test by the writer as here delineated for the past three years
the last series of random volunteers numbering twenty were twenty out of twenty with an average number of work hours of
per subject
offers the first anatomy of the human mind and techniques for handling the hitherto unknown mind which causes irrational and psychosomatic behavior
it has successfully removed any compulsions repressions neuroses and to which it has been applied
primary axioms is an science built upon axioms
rather than idealism has been consulted
the only claim made for these axioms is that by their use certain definite and predictable results can be obtained
the principal achievement of lies in its organization
almost any of its parts can be found somewhere in history even when they were independently evolved by the writer
there are no principal sources and where a practice or a principle is borrowed from some past school the connection is usually accidental and does not admit any further use or validity of that school
will work and can only be worked when regarded and used as a unity
when diluted by broader applications of older practices it will no longer produce results
to avoid confusion and prevent semantic difficulties new and simplified terminology has been used and is used only as defined herein
is actually a family of sciences
it is here addressed in the form of a science of thought applicable to psychosomatic ills and individual aberrations
the field of thought may be divided into two areas which have been classified as the and the
we are here concerned only with the
in the we place that data which we do not need to know in order to solve the problem of improving or resolving aberrations of the human mind
by thus splitting the broad field of thought we need not now concern ourselves with such as telepathy clairvoyance or for instance the human soul
conceiving this split as a line drawn through the area we can assign a dynamic principle of existence to all that data remaining in the field
after exhaustive research one word was selected as embracing the finite universe as a dynamic principle of existence
this word can be used as a guide or a measuring stick and by it can be evaluated much information
it is therefore our first and our controlling axiom
the first axiom is this can be seen to be the lowest common of the finite universe
it embraces all forms of energy
it further the purpose of that energy so far as it is now by us in the field
the activity of the finite universe can easily be seen to obey this axiom as though it were a command
all works and energies can be considered to be motivated by it
the various kingdoms have this as their lowest common for animals vegetables and minerals are all striving for survival
we do not know to what end we are surviving and in our field of the and in our choice of only the workable axioms we do not know and have no immediate reason to ask why
all forms of energy are then surviving to some unknown end for some unknown purpose
we need only to know that they are surviving and that as units or species they must by derivation from the first workable axiom we come into possession of the second
in obedience to the command survive life took on the form of a cell which joining with other cells formed a colony
the cell by expanded the colony
the colony by procreation formed other colonies
colonies of different types united and necessity and natural selection brought about specializing which increased the complexity of the colonies until they became an aggregation
the problems of the colonial aggregation were those of food protection and procreation
in various ways a colonial aggregation of cells became a standardized unity and any advanced colonial aggregation came into possession by necessity and natural selection of a central control system
the purpose of the colonial aggregation was to survive
to do this it had to have food means of defense protection and means of procreation
the control center which had developed had as its primary command survive its prime purpose was the food defense protection and means of procreation
thus can be stated the second workable axiom the purpose of the mind is to solve problems relating to the ultimate success of the organism its species or life would be at its unimaginable extreme immortality
the final failure in obedience to the law survive would be death
between eternal survival and death lie innumerable gradations
in the middle ground of such a scale would be mere existence without hope of much success and without fear of failure
below this point would lie step by step innumerable small errors accidents losses each one of which would tend to the chances of reaching the ultimate goal
above this point would lie the small successes appreciations and triumphs which would tend to secure the desirable goal
as an axiom the mind can then be said to act in obedience to a central basic command survive and to direct or manage the organism in its efforts to accomplish the ultimate goal for the individual or species or life and to avoid for the individual or species or life any part of the final failure which leads to the stated axiom the mind directs the organism the species its or life in the effort of survival
a study of the field of evolution will indicate that survival has been will be and is the sole test of an organism whether the organism is treated in the form of daily activity or the life of the species
no action of the organism will be found to lie without the field of survival for the organism is acting within its environment upon information received or recorded and error or failure does not alter the fact that its basic impulse was motivated by survival
another axiom may then be formulated as follows the mind as the central direction system of the body poses perceives and resolves of survival and directs or fails to direct their execution
as there are many organisms in the same species all attempting to accomplish the same end and as there are many species and as matter itself is attempting in one unit form or another to survive there is necessarily conflict and contest amongst the individuals of the species species or units of matter
species can not survive without being interested primarily in the species
natural selection and other causes have established this as a primary rule for survival that the unit remain alive as long as possible as a unit and by association and procreation that the species remain alive as a species
second grade interest is paid by the unit or the species to its
third grade interest is paid to inanimate matter
as this is apparently the most workable solution natural selection best preserves those species which follow this working rule
and the of the successful species therefore have enhanced opportunity for survival
man is the most successful organism currently in existence at least on this planet
man is currently winning in the perpetual cosmic election which possibly may select the thinker of the new thought
man is heir to the experience and construction of his own ancestors
as cellular conservatism is one of the factors of survival his brain is basically the same brain which directed and resolved the problems of his animal forebears
by evolution and natural selection this brain therefore has the primary priority in emergencies
superimposed on this animal brain has been developed an enormously complex which probably exists in his frontal lobe
the command survive is variable in individuals and species to the extent that it may be strong or weak
superior strength of the command in the individual or species is normally but a survival factor
the primary facet of personality is the basic strength of the dynamic the dynamic is variable from individual to individual and race to race
it is varied by physiology environment and experience
its manifestation in the animal brain affects the tenacity of the individual to life or purpose and it affects the activity of the
the first characteristic of the individual which should be considered is the basic strength of his dynamic
by this an axiom can be formulated the of the individual in life is directs y go b y the strength of his basic dynamic
the analytical human or as it has elsewhere been called erroneously the conscious mind is variable from individual to individual and race to race in its ability to perceive and resolve problems
another axiom can then be formulated intelligence is the ability of an individual group or race to resolve problems relating to survival
it should be noted that there is a distinct difference between the dynamic and the intelligence
high intelligence may not denote high dynamic
high dynamic may not denote high intelligence
intelligence is mental sensitivity and analytical ability
dynamic is the of the individual in obedience to the command survive it has been noted that there is a in the scale of survival
gains toward the ultimate goal are
failures toward the final defeat are or painful
pleasure is therefore the perception of wellbeing or an advance toward the ultimate goal
pain therefore is the perception of a reduction toward the final defeat
both are necessary survival factors
for the purpose of good and evil must be defined
those things which may be classified as good by an individual are only those things which aid himself his family his group his race mankind or life in its dynamic obedience to the command modified by the observations of the individual his family his group his race or life
as evil may be classified those things which tend to limit the dynamic thrust of the individual his family his group his race or life in general in the dynamic drive also limited by the observation the observer and his ability to observe
good may be defined as constructive
evil may be defined as destructive definitions modified by viewpoint
the individual man is an organism attempting to survive in affinity or contest with other men races and the three kingdoms
his goal is survival for himself his progeny his group his race his life and the universe in general in contest with any efforts or entities which threaten or his efforts to attain the goal
his happiness depends upon making consolidating or contemplating gains toward his it is a purpose of to pass man across the abyss of irrational solely thought and enter him upon a new stage of constructive progression to the ultimate goal
an analogy of the mind it is not the purpose of to reconstruct the human mind
the purpose of is to from the existing mind those physically painful experiences which have resulted in the aberration of the analytical mind to resolve the physical manifestations of mental aberration and to restore in its entirety the proper working function of a brain not otherwise physically deranged
thus embraces the various aspects of psychosomatic conditions including the glandular balance or imbalance of the organism as influenced by painful physical experience
however its purpose is not one of healing and its address is not to such somatic manifestations specifically but rather to those experiences in which these conditions have their roots
the initial adjustments of the individual are included in child and educational
judicial political and military are elsewhere touched upon or allocated for study
as a family of sciences proceeds however from the axioms touched upon in the last chapter and is uniformly governed by the principles of the behavior of the human mind
when an individual is acting contrary to survival of himself his group progeny race mankind or life he can be considered to be or
every single instance of conduct threatening the general goal of the individual as outlined in the last chapter can be proven to have a source which will specifically be found to be a painful experience containing data not available to the analytical mind
every single instance and facet of conduct has its exact in the physically painful error which has been introduced during a moment of absence of the analytical power
consists of discovering the aberration in the individual finding the physically painful experience which corresponds to it and placing the data therein contained at the disposal of the analytical mind
more as an effort to demonstrate how that is accomplished than as an actual outline of the character of the mind the following analogy is offered
first there is the section of the brain containing the motor controls the and the physical nervous system in general including the physical aspect of the analytical section of the brain
the control of all voluntary and involuntary muscles is contained in this section
it commands all body fluids blood flow respiration glandular secretion cellular construction and the activity of various parts of the body
experimentation has adequately demonstrated this
the mind has specific methods of thinking
these are entirely
animal experimentation rats dogs
is experimentation on and with precisely this mind and little more
it is a fully conscious mind and should never be denoted by any term which denies it consciousness since there is no period in the life of the organism from conception to death when this mind is not awake observing and recording
this is the mind of a dog cat or rat and is also the basic mind of a man so far as its operating characteristics are concerned
a man in the deepest possible sleep is still in possession of more mind and thinking and coordinating ability than a lower animal
the term consciousness is no more than a designation of the awareness of now
the mind never ceases to be aware of now and never ceases to record the successive instances of now which in their composite make up a time track connecting memory in an orderly chain
cessation of life alone the recording of perceptions on this orderly track
is a condition wherein the organism is only in its analytical process and motor control direction
in the section of the brain a complete time track and a complete memory record of all perceptions for all moments of the organisms existence is available
as life progresses for instance from a blade of grass greater and greater complexities and degrees of are possible
energy in its various forms is the primary in the lower orders but as the complexity of the order is increased into the animal kingdom the brain attains more and more command of the entire organism until it itself begins to possess the second section of the mind
all animals possess in some slight degree an
this which we designate the analytical mind is present even in lower orders since it is only that section of the brain which possesses the command of the brain and thus of the body
in a rat for instance it is no more than its conscious awareness of now applying to lessons of then without rationality but with instinct and painful experience
this is the analytical section of the mind in a lower animal but it is the mind in a man whose analytical mind is so highly attuned and intricate that it can command entirely the brain and thus the man not only possesses a superior mind but possesses as well an analytical mind of such power and complexity that it has no real rival in any other species
the analytical mind of man can not be studied by observing the reactions of animals under any
not only is it more sensitive but it possesses factors and sensitivities not elsewhere found
continuing this analogy lying between the analytical mind and the mind may be conceived the mind
this is the coordinated responses of the mind the analytical mind of animals and the first post of emergency command in man
all errors of a psychic or psychosomatic nature can be considered for the purposes of this analogy to lie in the mind
the first human analytical mind took command of the body and mind under strained and dangerous circumstances when man was still in violent contest with other species around him
it can be considered that the analytical mind received command with the single proviso that instantaneous emergency would be handled by the outdated but faster any and all errors in thinking and action derive from the mind as it is increased in strength and power by painful experience
it can be called a shadow mind instantaneously when any of its content is perceived in the environment of the individual at which time it urgently the analytical mind and causes immediate reaction in the mind and in the body
additionally the mind is in continual presence when chronically by a constantly present which is to say an approximation of the minds content or some part thereof continually perceived in the environment of the
the mind is in action so long as it is activated by an exact or nearly exact approximation of its content
but given too continuous a it can and does both the mind and body below it and the analytical mind above it
it was created by circumstances of a physical nature hence it
the entire content of the mind is records of physical pain with its accompanying perceptions during of the
all conduct and error on the part of an individual is occasioned by of his mind
none of these minds are unconscious nor are they subconscious
the entire organism is always conscious but the temporary dispersion of the thought processes of the analytical mind brings about a condition whereby that mind having been dispersed and considering itself the residence of the person is unable to obtain and reach data perceived and received by the organism during the analytical minds condition of dispersion
that the analytical mind can be thrown by pain or shock out of circuit is a survival factor of its own as sensitive machinery it must be protected by a fuse system
the dynamics the basic dynamic survive increases in complexity as the complexity of the organism evolves
energy may be considered to have taken many paths through eternity to arrive intact at the infinite goal
the why of the goal may lie above the finite line but below it by the word survive definite manifestations are visible
energy collects into various forms of matter which collect and aggregate in various materials and compounds
life evolves from the simplest basic into complex forms since evolutionary change is in itself a method of conflict amongst species and individuals within the species is additionally a survival factor
affinity of individuals for groups races and the whole of its species and for other species is additionally a survival factor as strong or stronger than conflict
drive is defined as the dynamic thrust through time toward the attainment of the goal
survive is considered to be the lowest common of all energy efforts and all forms
it can then be specifically into several drive lines as applicable to each form or species
the self contains eight main drives which are held in common with man
the dynamics are one self two sex three group four mankind five life six the physical universe seven thought eight universal thought or infinity
an entire philosophy can be built around each one of these dynamics which will account for all the actions of an individual
any one of these philosophies is so complete that it can be logically made to include the other seven
in other words all purpose of an individual can be rationalized into the dynamic of self
a philosophy exists which attempts to rationalize everything into the sexual dynamic and so on with all the dynamics
observing that each one can stand as a logical unity one finds it necessary to retire to the lowest common of the basic dynamic which actually does explain the eight subdivisions
as each one of the subdivisions is capable of supporting the whole weight of a rational argument it can readily be deduced that each is of nearly equal importance in the individual
the conditions of a society tend to vary the stress on these dynamics making first one and then another the keynote of the society
in an individual or society the validity of all eight would be recognized
the individual may possess or stress one or more of these dynamics above the others
in terms of basic personality the aspect of the individual is of varied strength in the eight each one of the eight dynamics breaks further into purposes which are specific and complex
purposes and other factors these dynamics and varying situations and the observational power of the individual may conflict one of these dynamics against another within the individual himself
this is a basic complex factor of personality
i the dynamic of self consists of the dynamic thrust to survive as an individual to obtain pleasure as an individual and to avoid pain
it covers the general field of food clothing and shelter personal ambition and general individual purpose
 the dynamic of sex embraces the procreation of progeny the care of that progeny and the securing for that progeny of better survival conditions and abilities in the future
 the dynamic of group embraces the various units of the species man such as the association the military company the people in the surrounding countryside the nation and the race
it is characterized by activity on the part of the individual to obtain and maintain the survival of the group of which he is a part
 the mankind dynamic embraces the survival of the species
note the first four dynamics belong to
the upper four introduced late complete the full eight dynamics of to
v the dynamic of life is the urge of the individual to survive for life and for life to survive for itself
 the physical universe dynamic is the drive of the individual to enhance the survival of all matter energy time and space
 the thought dynamic concerns the urge of the individual to survive as
the dynamic of universal thought is the urge of the individual to survive for the creator
while man is concerned with any one of the above dynamics any one of them may become to his own survival
this is rational conflict and is normally and commonly incidental to survival
it is in that it is rational within the educational limitation
the family as a unit is not a dynamic but a combination of dynamics
and in this and other societies it attains a position of interest which is not necessarily inherent in the individual or basically simple complexity is introduced amongst the dynamics by individual and group
the basic individual has continual difficulty the problems of and choices amongst these dynamics
when the basic individual becomes and is unable to reason freely on all problems a selection of amongst these dynamics becomes nearly impossible and produces solutions which may resolve such an extreme as the destruction of the individual himself by himself under the mistaken solution that he may thus obey the primary command
note all effort is irrationality of a precise nature which will often be found by the auditor in his during but which forms no part of the basic personality of that individual
this term covers anyone who is not clear however it is principally used to describe a person who through auditing is finding out more about himself and life
auditing the application of procedures to a by a trained cthe basic individual for the purposes of this work the terms basic and clear are nearly synonymous since they denote the self in complete integration and in a state of highest possible rationality a is one who has become the basic individual through auditing
the precise personality of the basic individual is of interest to the auditor
his complete characteristic is established by
the strength of his basic dynamic
the relative strengths of his dynamics
the sensitivity which is to say the intelligence of his
the coordination of his motor controls
his physiological and glandular condition
his environment and education
the experiences of each individual also create an individual composite and so may additionally designate individuality
there are as many distinct individuals on earth as there are men women and children
that we can establish a common of drive and basic function does not can not and will not alter the fact that individuals are amazingly varied one from the next
it will be found by experience and exhaustive research as it has been clinically established that the basic individual is invariably responsive in all the dynamics and is essentially good
there are varying degrees of courage but in the basic individual there is no
the virtues of the basic individual are innumerable
his intentional vices and destructive are nonexistent
he is in close alignment with that ideal which mankind recognizes as an ideal
this is a necessary part of an auditors working knowledge since deviations from it denote the existence of aberration and such departures are unnatural and enforced and are no part of the of the individual
man is not a animal
he is capable of
he has will power
he ordinarily has high analytical ability
he is rational and he is happy and integrated only when he is his own basic personality
the most desirable state in an individual is complete
such may be altered and shaped to some degree by education and environment but so long as the individual is not he is in possession of
so long as he is in his actions he adjusts himself successfully to the degree that his environment will permit such an adjustment
he will be more forceful effective and happier in that environment than when
that the basic personality is good does not mean that he can not be a terribly effective enemy of those things rationally recognizable as destructive to himself and to his
the basic individual is not a buried unknown or a different person but an intensity of all that is best and most able in the person
the basic individual equals the same person minus his pain and
the drive strength of the person does not derive from his aberrations
the aberrations lessen the drive strength
artistry personal force personality all are residual in the basic personality
this is derived from clinical research and experimentation
the only reason an occasionally holds hard to his aberrations is due to the fact that his have a content which forbids their removal
the mind consists of a collection of experiences received during an moment which contain pain and actual or conceived antagonism to the survival of the individual
an is a entity which can be precisely defined
the aggregate of compose the mind
a new entitled has been originated here to define adequately data
contains as one of its facets the field of
precisely as the field of is organized so is organized in each sensory perception
the communication system of man has its counterpart in various languages observable in lower animals
words are sounds in form delivered with a definite timbre pitch and volume or sight recognition in each case
words are a highly specialized form of
the quality of the sound in uttering the word is nearly as important as the word itself
the written word belongs in part to
having but lately acquired his extensive vocabulary the mind of man is least adjusted to words and their sense
the mind is better able to differentiate amongst qualities of utterance than amongst the meanings of words themselves
included in in the same fashion and on the same axioms as are the other sensory perceptions organic sensation the tactile sense the sense and the senses involved with sight and hearing
each has its own grouping
and each carries its class of messages with highly complex meanings
each one of these divisions of the senses is plotted in time according to the earliest or most forceful
each class of messages is so filed as to lead the individual toward pleasure and away from pain
the classifications and study of this varied sensory file has been designated
are received into the mind forming a area during moments of lowered analytical awareness of the individual and they contain physical pain and antagonism to survival
the is a packaged not available to the analytical mind but intimately connected to the mind
under normal conditions it reacts as a dramatization of itself when approximated by the organism perceptions of its content in the immediate environment during periods of weariness illness or hypnotic moments in the life of the individual
when injury or illness the analytical mind producing what is commonly known as and when physical pain and antagonism to the survival of the organism are present an is received by the individual
subsequently during moments when the potential of the analytical mind is reduced by weariness illness or similar circumstances one or more of the contained in the may be observed by the individual in his environment and without his perceiving that he has observed it or the identity of it the individual dramatizes the moment of receipt of the
an one or more dynamics of the basic individual
being antagonistic to his survival it can be considered to consist of a reverse charge
as an example the analytical mind can be said to possess multiple scanners in layers
ordinary or memory can be considered to have as an analogy only a positive charge
the multiple scanners are able to sweep these areas and make available memory data to the analytical mind so that it can arrive by various mathematical means at a solution for its various the as a specific memory package can be considered to have a reverse charge which can not be reached by the of the analytical mind but which is directly connected to the motor controls and other physical functions and which can exert at a depth not nearly as basic as the basic drive but nevertheless low a hidden influence upon the analytical mind through another circuit
the analytical mind in awareness of now nevertheless is unable to discover without assistance from an auditor the existence of such an impediment since it was received during a moment of extremely low potential on the part of the analytical mind
as a further analogy and for demonstration only an can be considered to be a bundle of perceptions of a precise nature
an is an entire dramatic sequence implanted during which possesses specific keys any one of which when perceived by the individual in his environment may in greater or lesser degrees set the into reaction
denied to the analytical mind at its reception it is denied to the analytical mind in its exact character during its dramatization
its content is literal and on the level demands action
mans analytical ability and his vocabulary are imposed above both the mind and the mind both on the evolutionary time track and in awareness
the charge contained in the is inexhaustible and remains in full force whenever keyed into the circuit by
are those approximations in the environment of an individual of the content of an
can exist in any of the various senses
the orderly filing of in the memory does not apparently include the content of these being filed separately under an immediate danger heading
there are three kinds of thought the first is or literal
it demands immediate action without examination by the analytical mind
a hand being withdrawn from a hot stove when burned is being governed by the principle but as the ensuing instant of caused by the shock is ordinarily slight no real can be said to have the second type of thought is justified thought
thought is literal without reason irrational
justified thought is the attempt of the analytical mind to explain the reactions of the organism in the ordinary course of living
every may cause some form of conduct on the part of the individual
justified thought is the effort of the conscious mind to explain away that aberration without admitting as it can not do normally that it has failed the organism
the third and optimum type of thought is rational thought
this is the thought used by a clear
an is an apparent in the mental circuit with certain definite finite content
that charge is not reached or examined by the analytical mind but that charge is capable of acting as an independent command
when the basic drive of the individual is boosted in potential by an observed necessity the residual charge in an is insufficient to contest at times the raised purpose
the analytical mind can then be seen to function in entire command of the organism without serious modification by command
at other times hostility in the environment and confusion of the analytical mind combine to reduce the dynamic potential to such a degree that the command in comparison to the basic drive can be seen to be extremely powerful
it is at such times in the presence of even faint that the individual most demonstrates his aberrations
example received at the age of three and years
adult
as child in dental chair against his will under antagonistic conditions given oxide and tricked by dentist
during painful portion of treatment the dentist says he is asleep
he cant hear feel or see anything
stay there
the which can be in this are the quality pitch and volume of the dentists voice the sound of the dentists drill the slap of the cable running the drill street noises of a specific kind the tactile of the mouth being forcibly held open the smell of the mask the sound of running water the smell of oxide and in short several of each class excluding only sight
the effect of this experience being a part of an chain which contained two earlier experiences was in some small degree to trance the individual and maintain some portion of him in a state
this is too brief and extraordinarily simple but it will serve as an example to the auditor
the timeless quality of the suggestions the conceived antagonism on the chain awakened and all these things confused the time sense of the individual and were otherwise in later life
for every there is a somatic as part of that
no aberration exists without its unless it is a aberration in which instance it is compatible with its environment and so is not considered irrational
every aberration contains its exact command in some
the numbers of per individual are relatively few
the condition of the individual does not depend on the number of but the severity of individual
an is severe in the exact ratio that it is conceived by the organism to have been a moment of threat to survival
the character of the threat and the content produce the aberration
a number of with similar in an individual produce a complex aberration pattern which nevertheless has for its parts individual
an aberration is the manifestation of an and is serious only when it influences the competence of the individual in his environment
are of two types depending upon the duration of
there are and
a floater has not been in the individual during the lifetime succeeding it
a chronic is an which has been more or less continuously so that it has become an apparent portion of the individual
a chronic begins to gather locks
a floater has not accumulated locks since it has never been
a lock can be conceived to be joined to an in such a way that it can be reached by the multiple scanners of the analytical mind which can not reach the
a lock is a painful mental experience
it is or is not regarded by the analytical mind as a source of difficulty or aberration
it is a period of mental anguish and is wholly dependent upon an for its pain value
when an is activated into a chronic it accumulates numerous locks along the time track of the individual
the itself is not immediately except along the time track of the individual
locks are of some diagnostic value but as they exist as experiences more or less by the analytical mind they can be depended upon to vanish upon the removal of the from the mind
the running of a lock as a lock has some value but the exhaustion of locks from an individual is long and arduous and is seldom productive of any lasting result
upon the location and exhaustion of the from the mind all of its locks vanish
an may exist as a floater for any number of years or for the entire duration of an life
at any future moment after the receipt of an whether that time period consists of days or decades the floater may at which time it becomes part of the command obeyed by the analytical mind in its efforts to rationalize
the removal of the individual from his which is to say the environment in which the was is in itself a form of therapy since the may then return to its status as a floater
example at birth occurs the phrase no good uttered during a moment of headache and gasping on the part of a child
lock at the age of seven while the child was ill with a minor malady the mother in a fit of rage said that he was no good
the removal of the also removes ordinarily without further attention the lock
note birth remained inactive in the above case as a floater until the moment of reduced analytical power at the age of seven when a birth phrase was repeated
it is worth remarking that the entire content of the birth is given simultaneously both to the child and to the mother with only the difference of
it is further worthy of note that the mother quite often perceives in the child a and uses against it the phrases which were said when the child gave the mother the greatest pain namely birth
the child is then victimized into various psychosomatic ills by the repetition of its birth which may develop even more seriously into actual disease
the brain controls the multiple and complex functions of the growth and condition of the organism
containing organic sensation as one of its the then when reactivated causes a somatic and additionally may deny body fluids ie
hormones and blood to some portion of the anatomy psychosomatic ills
the denial of fluid or adequate blood supply may result in a potentially area
the psychosomatic reduces the resistance of some portion of the body to actual disease
somatic and other sensory errors find their basis in unconscious antagonistic moments
a somatic may be adjusted by an address to a lock but
the of adjustment only until such time as the is again reactivated causing another lock
all aberrations are occasioned by
an is severely painful or severely threatening to the survival of the organism and is an only if it can not be reached by the awake analytical mind
a simple approximation of the action of an can be accomplished by an experiment in whereby a positive suggestion which contains a signal is delivered to an person
the subject having been commanded to forget the suggestion when awake will then perform the act
this suggestion is then actually a light portion of the mind
it is literally interpreted unquestionably followed since it is received during a period of unawareness of the analytical mind or some portion of it
the which may be the act of the operator adjusting his tie causes the subject to commit some act
the subject will then try to explain why he is doing what he is doing no matter how illogical that action may be
the suggestion is then recalled to the subjects mind and he remembers it
the compulsion vanishes unless it is laid upon an actual
the obedience of the subject to the command has as its source thought
the explanation by the subject for his own action is the analytical mind observing the organism which it supposes is in its sole charge and justifying itself
the release of the suggestion into the analytical mind brings about rational thought
can be considered to be painfully inflicted often timeless suggestions delivered to the unconscious subject
the suggestion given the subject in the above example would not have any permanent effect on the subject even if it were not removed by the operator because there was presumed to be no antagonism involved unless of course it rested on a former
the mind of an organism never ceases recording on some level
the exact moment when recording begins in an organism has not at this date been accurately determined
it has been found to be very early probably earlier than four months after conception and five months before birth
in the presence of pain any moment prior to the age of two years may be considered to be
any painful experience received by the contains its full package including darkness
once an auditor has worked a and has seen its influence upon the chain and the awake life of the adult no question will remain in his mind concerning the actuality of the experience
that the does record is attributable to a phenomenon of the extension of perceptions during moments of pain and the absence of the analytical mind
laboratory experiment demonstrates that under hypnosis an individuals sensory perception may be artificially extended
the existence of pain in any large degree is sufficient to extend the hearing of the so that it records during the existence of pain and the presence of exterior sound the entire and complete record of the experience
as a chronic is but precariously fixed on the mind the syllables or voice contained in the will the somatic and the emotional content whenever the approximations of that appear in the or the adults vicinity
the understanding of language is not necessary to an since the recording of the brain is so precise that the utterance of the identical words in similar tones during later periods or during birth or immediately after birth can and may occasion the original or any of the to become producing locks injuring the health of the infant or for that matter of the
the of the are extended only during moments of pain
but a chain of can occasion a condition wherein the hearing of the is chronically extended forming numerous locks before birth
these locks will vanish when the actual are discovered and exhausted from the
any painful moment containing antagonism is not only a matter of record but a source of potential action in the human organism at any period during its lifetime reserving of course the question of when the first begins to record
birth is ordinarily a severely painful unconscious experience
it is ordinarily an of some magnitude
anyone who has been born then possesses at least one
any period of absence of analytical power during receipt of physical pain has some potentiality
moments when the analytical power is present in some quantity when physical pain is absent and only antagonism to the organism is present do not form and are not responsible for the aberration of the individual
sociological maladjustments parental punishments of a minor sort even when they include pain childhood struggles and jealousies are not capable of the individual
these can influence the personality and environmental adjustment of the individual but so long as he is not incompetent he can and will resolve these problems and remain without aberration
the human mind is an enormously powerful organism and its analytical ability is great
it is not overlaid above naturally or evil desires but is founded upon powerful and constructive basics which only powerful painful and antagonistic experiences can
will be found to have been conceived by the individual as intensely antagonistic to the survival of the organism
the discovery of the basic is the first problem of the auditor
it normally results in an chain
the content of that chain will be found to be physically severe
an is physically painful is conceived by the organism as an antagonistic threat to its survival and is received during the absence of the analytical power of the mind
these factors may vary within the so that an may be of minimal pain maximal antagonism and minimal absence of the analytical power
note one has as much functioning as one has awareness of no w the body is to some degree reliving the experience of the whenever the experience is
a chronic psychosomatic such as a painful arm indicates the chronic continuous coexistence with now of the moment the arm was broken or hurt
several reactivated into a chronic state bring several moments of pain and antagonism into a coexistence with no w the is a bundle of which include as the primary manifestation organic sensation
the organic sensation is enforced on the members of the body to a greater or lesser degree whenever and as long as the is
there is only one psychosomatic command which is common to all
any contains this as part of the command it will enforce upon the body
as a stomach may be made to ache chronically to feel broken the also enforces a command upon the organ of the analytical mind
that command is common to every
are valid only when they are received during a momentary dispersal or shocked null condition of the analytical mind
every contains and enforces the command on the analytical mind that it has been dispersed and is not operating
this is common to every
this is reduction of the intellect by totally aside from specific content
it explains at once insanity and also the remarkable mental facility of a cleared or released individual
c
aberrations all aberrations of any kind are of precisely the same nature as covered in the last chapter
it is the content of the which causes the aberration and forms its nature
complexity amongst contents may demonstrate a most complex aberration
the various commands contained in the and modifying the basic dynamic command of the mind produce abnormal characteristics in the behavior of the analytical mind which are chronic or sporadic as the them are
an entire concept of existence may be built from content
conflicts in the commands contained in and conflicts between the basic drive and the contents combine into behavior when the organism has become so impeded that it can no longer influence or command its environment it can be considered to be insane in that environment
change of environment may relieve the condition or more certainly the exhaustion of the content of the mind will restore the ability of the analytical mind to solve the problems with which it is confronted
whatever the content of the mind and its potential influence upon the behavior of the individual it does not necessarily follow that the mind need be chronically
however when the mind has been consistently the analytical mind called upon to solve the problems around and through antagonistic and incorrect data may be unable to perform its task
in the absence of disease or injury any mind not in a physiological state may be restored to normal function by the removal of the mind
it should be noted however that this is modified by the fact that people who have received insulin shocks electric shocks and other treatments are regarded as equivocal and are temporarily classed with disease cases for lack of adequate observation in this stage of the experimental research
people can be regarded as rational or irrational only insofar as they react in their customary environment
but any person in possession of a mind is an unknown quantity until that mind has been examined
there are several factors contained in the in the mind which most certainly tend toward aberration
these include commands which the time sense of the individual and thus apparently destroy his time track and which contain of such and such content remain thereafter continually with the individual and seem to arrest him or him in time
containing commands which make the individual chronically unable to conceive differences are especially harmful since these tend to compare everything to value and thus cause the individual to arrive at a chronic state of thinking
the mind resolves problems related to survival utilizing its ability to conceive similarities and differences
which destroy or tend to hold in suspension the analytical minds ability to conceive associations most influence the apparent intelligence of the mind
but which tend by their command content to destroy the minds ability to conceive differences may produce severe aberration
example all men are alike received as powerful content would tend to compare and associate every man with those men contained in the mind as painful and dangerous
an aberration may attain any form of complexion
as a rough analogy a compulsion may be conceived to be an command that the organism must do something a repression is a command that the organism must not do something a neurosis is an emotional state containing conflicts and emotional data inhibiting the abilities or welfare of the individual and a is a conflict of commands which seriously reduce the individuals ability to solve his problems in his environment to a point where he can not adjust some vital phase of his environmental needs
all this variety of manifestation of aberration is occasioned by the commands or contents of
physical aberrations are occasioned by when they are not the result of injury or disease even then the aspect may be improved by the exhaustion of the mind of the sick individual
the can not manifest itself as a mental aberration without also manifesting itself to some degree as somatic aberration
removal of the somatic content of which is also necessary to obtain any other relief can and does occasion glandular readjustment cellular inhibition and other physiological corrections
cthe tone scale the tone scale denotes numerically first the status of an in the mind next its or reduction and provides a measure for sanity in an individual
the derivation of this scale is clinical and is based upon observation of being worked
when an is located and developed the extreme range it can follow begins with apathy develops into anger or the various facets of antagonism proceeds into boredom and arrives at last in cheerfulness or vanishes utterly
the tone scale is essentially an of numerical value by which individuals can be numerically classified
it is not arbitrary but will be found to approximate some actual governing law in nature
zero is equivalent to death
an individual with a zero tone would be dead
ranging upwards from zero to one then is that emotional bracket which may be denoted as apathy along its graduated scale from death to the beginnings of apathetic resentment
from one to two is the range of antagonism including suspicion resentment and anger
boredom and its equivalents by which is denoted minor annoyance begin at two and end at three
from three to four are the emotions which range from carelessness to cheerfulness
the term tone four denotes a person who has achieved rationality and cheerfulness
each residual in the mind has its own independent tonal value
serious will be found in the apathy range
dangerous will be found in the anger range
above two point five an could not be considered to have any great power to affect the analytical mind
each in the mind then can be said to possess a tone value
the composite sum of these will give if added a numerical value to the mind
can be computed as they lie along the dynamics and to each dynamic may be assigned a tone
the sum of the tones of the dynamics divided by the number of the dynamics will give a potential numerical value for an individual
this of course is variable depending on the existence of in his environment to the
the probable average of mankind at this writing may be in the vicinity of  complete rationality depends upon exhaustion of the mind and complete rationality is invariably the result of reaching tone four
the initial diagnosis is done by the of a general tone to denote the condition of an individuals mind
his methods of meeting life his emotional reaction to the problems in his environment can be evaluated by the use of the tone scale
in auditing as will be covered later an normally can be expected to run from its initial value in the apathy or anger range to tone four
very shortly after it reaches tone four it should vanish
if it vanishes without attaining the laughter of tone four it can be assumed that the individuals basic has not been erased
the tone scale has value in auditing and should be thoroughly understood
cthe character of there are several general types of
it must be understood that the mind possesses a time track of one sort or another and that this track is a specific thing
the time track of an individual will include all those things available to his analytical mind when in a light trance or during regression
however a person can be and the data which he can easily contact along his time track is definitely not even if it possesses an emotional charge
everything on this track will be rational or justified experience
it will not include
it may include locks which is to say that it may include moments of mental anguish or antagonism and may even include of which have some slight command value
an has several specific positive characteristics
it is received by the individual at some moment of physical pain
it is not available to the and it includes conceived or actual antagonism to the survival of the organism
certain mechanics such as forget it may swerve a painful or unconscious experience off the time track
in that case it becomes possessed of command value
all with power to the analytical mind and the physical body lie off the time track and are not available to the analytical mind
by reason of its disorganization during the moment the was received or because it has been forcibly instructed that the data in the is not to be recalled the can not reach the by ordinary means because the data has been erroneously labelled dangerous important or too painful to touch
the then by a bypass circuit feeds hidden commands into the
by a direct instantaneous circuit it is permanently connected to the motor controls all channels the glands and heart
it is awaiting a moment of low general tone weariness or injury when the analytical mind has reduced powers
it is also awaiting the perception of one or more of the in the environment of the continuous of the can in itself cause a low general tone which in its turn permits more to become
as the mind comes into a more or less completely chronic state of the individual becomes more and more governed by this mind
his thought becomes more and more and he can be seen to drop in general tone on the tone scale down to the break point which may be arbitrarily placed somewhere between and
and below which lies the region of insanity
thought is irrational by which the mind is made to conceive identities where only vague similarities may exist
it is necessary that the auditor thoroughly understand thought for it is with this complete irrationality of identity that he will basically deal
as he works with any he must continually employ in the bulk of his computation on the case the equation of thinking
thinking can be stated by a equals a equals a equals a equals a the when one or more of its is perceived in the environment during a moment of low general tone may dramatize
the dramatization is the precise content of the
the aberration is the precise content of the
the reaction of an individuals analytical mind when an is reactivated is justification
there is reason to believe that part of this survival mechanism consists of the axiom the must never permit an incorrect solution
the brings about many incorrect solutions
the may very well become entirely involved with the attempt to discover and deliver to a society or to itself adequate rational reasons for the behavior of the organism
the analytical mind though working from the command of the itself is unaware of the source of the command
not being able to discover the source it more and more in an effort to solve a problem which contains danger to the organism
the analytical mind tends to find the danger without and within the organism
there are five ways that the organism can react to a danger in its vicinity
it can attack it avoid it neglect it run from it or succumb to it
in just these ways can the analytical mind which it must be remembered is possessed of and will power react to the mind
as the general tone lowers as the analytical mind becomes less and less powerful through weariness continual reverses in general health
the more and more heed it must give to the problems unsolved in the mind
these are in essence unsolved problems
as such they contain their own solutions
the analytical mind unable to reach them the organisms reaction to them to them causes the organism to attempt to flee from them may neglect them as in avoids them in many intricate ways or attacks them
the analytical mind is not only not certain where the experience lies on the time track it also does not know whether the menace is within the organism or without it
so it can become entirely indiscriminate and eventually it may achieve highly irrational solutions by which it seeks to solve the problems of the highly irrational mind
the deep sensory perception channel entering the mind is evidently equipped with an which sorts according to the momentary general tone or potential of the analytical mind
the higher the general tone or potential of the analytical mind the better the data in the is sorted
the circuits are evidently fully of content in the mind and evaluate perceived in the environment against the general tone of the analytical mind
when that is low route more or less directly to the mind which instantly responds by fixed connections into the motor controls
commands to the various members muscles glands and organs of the body may be sporadic or constant producing a high variety of responses in the body
entire vocabularies are fed into the voice circuits directly from the mind when an is
orders to be active or inactive are fed to other portions
the individual time track of the spaces the commands to the organism and a dramatization is accomplished which may contain a portion or all of the content of the as governed by the situation
psychosomatic ills rages tantrums criminal acts and any and all content prejudicial to the survival of the organism in which the organism is seen to be indulging has as its source the mind
the sole and only content of the mind is what exterior sources have done to the none of the content of the mind is
the auditor is then interested only in what is done to the person not what the person himself has done since for purposes of auditing the acts of the organism in its society can be discounted beyond diagnosis
even then they are of small importance to the auditor
an organism possessed of an analytical mind not victimized by disease or injury and will commit no act knowingly prejudicial to the survival of the organism or other facets within the dynamics
it will combat only those dangers in society which are actual whatever may be the status of the innate moral sense the basic intent of the basic personality is to further various energy forms along the dynamics toward the goal
only moments of actual dispersal of the awareness of the analytical mind permit data to be received which is prejudicial to the intent of the dynamics
only from these unconscious moments can the basically stable and enormously powerful and able analytical mind be through the implantation of unanalyzed painfully administered and antagonistic
it is the purpose of the auditor to find and exhaust these moments from the life of the individual
auditing includes therefore as its basic principle the exhaustion of all the painfully unconscious moments of a subjects life
by pain from the life of an individual the auditor returns the individual to complete rationality and sanity
the auditor should never be content with merely bringing the person back to normal
he should achieve with the person a tone even though this is far in advance of the average state of society at this time
a tone with his drives intact and powerful with his rationality and intelligence increased to the optimum becomes extremely valuable to the society whatever his knowing this the auditor can expect a maximum result of lasting duration with any not physically hopeless
the entire purpose of the auditor is to the basic dynamic and the normal purpose or profession of the individual whom he
anything implanted by positive suggestion or education in the course of auditing is harmful and must be cancelled if delivered
only the basic personality of the individual can decide and evaluate things in his environment
therefore as practiced with positive suggestions should be shunned since any and all hypnotic commands with the attendant mechanisms are no more than artificially implanted
indeed it is quite usual for the auditor to have to exhaust hypnotically planted material received either from some or from the analytical mind itself when the person has been operating under
as such does not work and a study and short practice in will reveal exactly why
the auditor is attempting to the mind from the individual
this mind is an infestation of foreign careless and unreasoning commands which disrupt the of the individual to such an extent that he no longer has charge through his analytical mind of the organism itself but finds himself under the continual and chronic orders of unseen exterior forces often and usually to the survival of the organism
deal with identities where no identities exist
they therefore pose many strange and irrational problems which are seen as aberrations in
if a human being has been born he can be supposed to have at least one
anyone who has a birth which has not been cleared by therapy has therefore a mind
there is no disgrace attached to having a mind since it was thrust without his consent and without his knowledge upon an unconscious and helpless individual
sometimes this was done by persons with the best of intentions
a person not possessed of a rational mind can not be rationally considered to be morally responsible no matter the demands of the current society which hitherto lacked any method of determining responsibility
the pain contained in the mind is normally severe
the usual parental punishments family complications minor accidents and the battle of the individual with his environment influence but do not cause a mind nor do these things have the power to change materially the reactions of an individual
in the background of any individual exist many hidden personalities contained in the mind
dealing in identities the mind often confuses identities of individuals
therefore irrational attachments and are formed by individuals who can often find no reason for such attachments or in their contemporary environment
the content of an is literally interpreted not as it was stated to the unconscious subject but as it was received in its most literal phraseology and perception
the organism possesses many inherent mechanisms and abilities by which it can learn or preserve or forward itself along the dynamics
any one of them may be exaggerated by to a point where it becomes an actual threat to the organism or it
can and do all the sensory perceptions any and all parts of the body and the mind itself
by demanding suicide the can destroy the entire organism
the error of the mind was introduced by the evolution of speech for which the basic mechanism was not designed
when all save speech formed the mind it was to some degree serviceable
with speech came such complexities of perception and such interchanges of ideas that a whole series of illusions and could be derived from the minds necessity to determine identities for purposes of emergency
with speech the mind came to possess far more power and extensive content
the analytical mind being a delicate mechanism in some respects no matter how rugged and capable in others then could become subjected to and illusions which however shadowy and unreal must nevertheless be obeyed
by the mind of its past painful content the analytical mind may be placed in complete command of the organism
the moment a man or a group becomes possessed of this ability it becomes possessed of
so long as these possess minds will persist
because it contains literal speech no mind can be conceived to be of any value whatsoever to the rational organism since the methods of that mind remain intact and will continue to act to preserve the organism in times of of the analytical mind
there is no residual good in any mind
it is capable of any illusion
it has no assist power along the dynamics save only to cancel or modify other mind content
the source of the individuals power and purpose is not derived from the mind but from the basic dynamic and its eight divisions
any auditor will establish this to his own satisfaction after he has run a very few cases
when an individual during auditing is attempting to hold on to his aberrations the auditor may be assured that that person has as part of the content of the mind such phrases as dare get rid of it which identically translated apparently applies to aber rations
it may in fact apply in an containing an attempted abortion
the identity factor in the mind may cause the analytical mind to respond irrationally in auditing and to justify the aberrations in many irrational ways
whatever means he uses or statements he makes to avoid the exhaustion of his mind is contained exactly in the mind as a positive suggestion and has no application whatsoever in rational thought
individuality if by that is meant a mans desires and habits is not traced to the mind save when by individuality is meant those flagrant eccentricities which pass in for characters
a man is much more an individual after his mind has been cleared
c
dramatization dramatization is the duplication of an content entire or in part by an in his present time environment
conduct is entirely dramatization
conduct will occur only when and if an exists in the mind of the
that conduct will be a duplication of such an
the degree of dramatization is in direct ratio to the degree of of the causing it
a mild dramatization would be a similarity to the
a severe dramatization would be an identity with the
the general tone of an when high when his person is and he is well and not directly menaced in his environment does not permit as great an influence by the mind since the tone level of the entire individual possesses too great a differential from the tone of the
as the general tone of the individual approaches the tone level of the under dramatization becomes more severe
the analytical mind is present to the degree that the general tone of the is high
as this general tone lowers through ill health reverses or constant of the mind the analytical mind is proportionately less aware
dramatization is demonstrated by the in inverse ratio to the potential of the analytical mind
a geometrical progression is entered as general tone lowers to cause the analytical mind to lose its entire awareness potential
once every contains as the common of all the of the organ which is the analytical mind gain rapidly as this interaction progresses
in the presence of a relatively high analytical mind dramatization takes the form of similarity
the data of the is present but is interspersed with or by justified thought
the physical pain which is always present as part of the dramatization is equally mild a duplication of the pain which was present during the
the awareness potential of the analytical mind reduces in the of the which again reduces the general tone
the is subject to almost continuous dramatization of one or another as the appear in his vicinity
although the aberration may be so mild as to include only some chronically affected organ
complete dramatization is complete identity
it is the in full force in present time with the taking one or more parts of the personae present in the
he may dramatize all the actors or merely one of them
his dramatization is identity is and always entirely
when the analytical mind reaches the low point of awareness potential it held during the incident that point is also forced upon the as a part of the dramatization
the may also dramatize himself as he was at the moment of the receipt
the words physical actions expressions and emotions of an undergoing an identity dramatization are those of the single or various personae present in the
an which can be may at any time in an future be as an identity dramatization when and if his general tone is low and his environment becomes infiltrated by
an because of high general tone and other factors may not suffer the of an for a number of years after its receipt
a large number of may be present and in any if he has never been presented with their particular in an optimum moment for
the common of all insanity is the absence of all or almost all awareness potential in the analytical mind
insanity can be acute or chronic
any identity dramatization is insanity by which is meant the entire absence of rationality
the commonly and chronically dramatizes locks
the content may compel or repress the whenever
an irrational person is irrational to the degree that he dramatizes or to content in his mind
the computations which can be made on the basis of dramatization are infinite
the mind thinks in identities
are severe as they approach identity with the which force them into being in the conduct of the
the can profit in many ways by these principles of dramatization
by examination of the rage or apathy or hysteria patterns of the the will find himself in possession of the exact character of the for which he is searching
in the case of the manic the or the zealot an has entirely blocked at least one of the purpose lines deriving from a dynamic
the may be called an assist
its own not the dynamic force leads the individual to believe that he has a high purpose which will permit him to escape pain
this purpose is a false purpose not ordinarily sympathetic with the organism having a hectic quality derived from the pain which is part of it even though that pain is not wittingly experienced
this assist is using the native ability of the organism to accomplish its false purpose and brings about a furious and destructive effort on the part of the individual who without this assist could have better accomplished the same goal
the worst feature of the assist is that the effort it commands is dramatization of a particular sort and if the itself is the individual becomes subject to the physical pain and fear which the entire experience contained
therefore the false purpose itself is subject to sporadic sag
this sag becomes longer and longer in duration between periods of false thrust
it is easy to confuse in casual observation an assist and an actual valid drive unless one also observes the interspersed periods of sag
the assist may or may not occasionally accomplish something but it does accomplish a confusion in the society that the dynamics of the individual are derived from his bad experiences
this is a thing which is emphatically untrue
inherently the individual has great will power
this however can be
will power or its absence occasions the attitude of the toward his mind
the prevention of the dramatization of an or a lock further reduces dynamic thrust of the
chronic prevention lowers his general tone toward the break point
dramatization as it contains of a physical pain and the reduced potential of the analytical mind produces other harmful effects
necessity can and does render inactive the entire mind
dramatization occurs most often in the absence of necessity or when the mind has obscured the presence of necessity
dramatization is residual in the motor controls including speech and can be by the physical exhaustion of the individual
the organism during dramatization tends to toward the moment of the occurrence the containing as one of its identity parts the complete physical condition of the organism as at the moment of of the
there is no folly or facet of human activity which can not be
an immediate alleviation can be achieved when addressing an who is in identity dramatization by acting upon the fact that the conditions of auditing with no exception already exist ie
the returned to the moment of occurrence
affinity may be established and auditing begun at once
he can be persuaded to listen for the phrases he is uttering and they can be by exhaustion on routine procedure
cthe auditors code not because it is a pleasant thing to do or because it is a noble idea the auditor must always treat a in a certain definite way which can be outlined as the auditors code
failure to follow this code will cause trouble to the auditor will considerably lengthen and disturb his work and may endanger the
the auditor in the first place at the optimum should be himself cleared otherwise he will find that many of his own are as he listens to the of his
this may cause his own to become chronic him with various allergies and and causing him to be at best extremely uncomfortable
an auditor can audit while he himself is being cleared as this is a peculiar and special method of locating his own since they become
becoming painful to him they can be found and speedily removed
even if he is not himself cleared the auditor must act like a clear towards the
the auditors code is the natural activity of a clear
the auditor must act toward the exactly in the way that the as an organism would desire that his own conscious analytical mind would react to and consider the organism
an affinity must therefore be maintained at all costs
the auditor must never permit himself to lose his temper become aggravated to or or antagonize the in any way
to do so would not merely disturb the comfort of the but might additionally him and might even prohibit further beneficial therapy by the auditor
the code is nearly
the auditor must be confident in that he must continually reassure the when cause despondency on the part
a cheerful optimistic presence encourages the through his most painful experiences
the auditor must be courageous never permitting himself to be intimidated by either the aggression or hostility of the
the auditor must be kind never indulging in hostilities or personal prejudices
the auditor must be trustworthy never betraying or denying a and above all never breaking his word to the
an auditor must be clean for personal odors or bad breath may be to the or may disturb him
the auditor must take care not to offend the concepts or sensibilities of the
the auditor must be persistent never permitting the case of the to either resist him or to remain unsolved until it is in a proper tone four since the of is a malady unto itself unless they are being properly exhausted
the auditor must be patient never hurrying or harassing the beyond the needs of stirring an into view
he must be willing to work at any and all times necessary and for the length of time necessary to exhaust the in process of elimination
in addition to these things it may be remarked that a definite affinity is established between the auditor and during the auditing
in the case of opposite sexes this affinity may amount to an infatuation
the auditor must remain aware of this and know that he can and should redirect the infatuation to some person or activity other than himself when auditing is at an end
not to do so is to produce an eventual situation wherein the may have to be rebuffed with consequent trouble for the auditor
c
auditing the auditing technique consists of assisting the analytical mind or some part of it with the auditor analytical mind
the auditor then functions during each successive period of auditing and only during the periods themselves as an extra analytical mind of the
the mind was received during the dispersal or inactivity of the analytical mind
the mind is removed by returning the to the and laying its contents before the scrutiny of the analytical mind
this technique may be considered the lowest common of a number of techniques
anything which will serve this purpose and permit auditing to be accomplished efficiently is valid technique
the optimum is purely personal affinity brought about by understanding and communication with the on agreeable subjects
another and almost useless method is together with the drugs and used to produce sleep
methods can be found such as faith healing books on medical hypnosis the techniques of medicine men and so forth
it is pointless to these methods here
they are currently available under the name of but a caution should be enjoined that hypnosis as itself is not at all acceptable to and indeed has extremely limited use
briefly however it must be remarked that if is studied to advance these techniques all positive suggestion and suggestion must be avoided as these suggestions depend for their effectiveness upon the already existing content of the mind and will only form additional locks
any and all hypnotic drugs have definite since they like so many other things may be termed shotgun methods
these paralyze not only the analytical mind but the remainder of the organism so that it is nearly impossible to obtain the proper somatic reaction in the
they are not anesthetics but
by using them the auditor instantly denies himself the main material which will lead him to the which is to say physical pain
such pain is never of very great magnitude and is obliterated by the use of
at no time should the auditor permit the to be under the delusion that he is being hypnotized
this is mentioned because is a current fad and the principles of have nothing whatever to do with
both are based upon simple natural laws but have between them an enormous gulf
one is the tool of the and the other is the science of the human mind
regression in its simplest form hereafter called return is employed in auditing
it would be an extraordinary case which required
return is the method of retaining the body and the awareness of the subject in present time while he is told to go back to a certain incident
dates are not mentioned
his size is not mentioned
various means are used to his memory
any of the may be employed to return him to some period of his past
he is told simply to go back to the time when
he is asked to recount what he can of the incident
he is told that he is right there and that he can recall this
little else is said by the auditor save those hints necessary to return the to the proper time
the is not allowed at any moment to in that period since the data is drained as a from his time track to present time
he is told that he can remember this in present time since that will occasion the to return to present time
most of the data is located by observing some somatic pain in the individual or some somatic aberration and seeking to discover wherein it was received
the are employed primarily because the motor controls possess a less disturbed time track than the sensory strip
anything which tends to these is then to auditing
it must be remembered that there is no aberration without an accompanying somatic
the alone being physical ills of one sort or another hold the content of the mind in place
the motor controls can be returned to a period although the conscious or analytical mind believes itself to be entirely in present time
by talking to the muscles or motor controls or various bodily aches and pains the auditor can shift them at will up and down their time track
this time track is not connected to the analytical mind and speech but is apparently a parallel time track with greater reliability than the sensory track
the precision of data contained in the motor control time track is enormous
muscles can be made to tense or relax
aches and pains can be made to come and go simply by uttering the right words for the or the wrong words
it is the primary task of the auditor to cause the time tracks of the motor strip and the sensory strip to come into parallel
that the time track exists in the strips has not been proven but they can so be considered for the purposes of this explanation
that they exist is extremely apparent
the motor strip time track can be asked questions down to the smallest moment of time and the area of an can be so located and its character determined
as an analogy a dream may be considered as the reception by the remaining analytical mind of a reflected and indirectly received picture of the
this applies only when the dream is specifically directed at the mind
it will be found that a with a large and active mind does not dream to any great extent in normal sleep but that a release may dream pleasantly and consistently
a dream in its normal function is that powerful and original mechanism called the imagination or creating new pictures
the use of the dream is not highly technical and has little value in
the auditor data from the by his own remarks about any subject or by the on a subject
the auditor tells the to dream about this data
when the has had the dream he is directed to go back to the causing the dream
quite often he will do so
if he does not or if he becomes hostile it is certain that an exists on the the lie detector the and many other means are of limited usefulness in determining both the character and the extent of the since into these as into the dreams can be fed the of the
a codified list can be created which will be found to be common to most
it should include all types of illnesses accidents the common trite phrases of the society and names of various persons who commonly surround a child during his childhood
such a codified list would be interesting for experiment and every auditor can compose his own
these are best composed after auditing the individual and after inquiry into his life to determine the various of thought
in that are identity thought the remarks of the about his will be found to be included in the content of those
when the is asked to imagine a bad situation at certain ages and under hypnotic conditions he will very often deliver up a complete
the auditor must realize that every remark that a makes while he is going over his mind is probably some part of the content of that mind
that mind is literal
the words the uses when referring to it must be literally evaluated
c
diagnosis it is a useful and positive principle that whatever confronts or contests the analytical mind of the will also confront and contest the analytical mind of the auditor
when the auditor is acting as the analytical mind of the whatever emotion or antagonism is directed towards him is the emotion or antagonism which is directed by the mind toward the own analytical mind
if a can not hear what people are saying in his he has another about cant hear
if he can not feel anything in his it is because he has an about cant feel
if he can not see he has an about not being able to see and so forth
if he can not return he has an about going back or returning to childhood or some such thing
if he is doubtful and skeptical about what is happening or what has happened to him it is because he has an about being doubtful and skeptical
if he is antagonistic his mind contains a great deal of antagonism
if he is or embarrassed it is because his mind contains or embarrassment
if he insists on maintaining his own control refusing to do what the auditor tells him to do although he is returned it is because he has an about and so forth and so on
this is identity thought and is used in diagnosis
the return is the best method of learning the problems of the
trying to work the into remembrance hearing seeing feeling going back and forward going to sleep awakening and taking due notice of what he says about the entire process will form a rather complete diagnosis on one who is not insane
questioning the as to what is wrong with him while returned will elicit replies straight out of his principal
listening to an endless justification of his actions is both a delay and a waste of time but listening to what he has to say about what he thinks has happened to him or what he is afraid of is of definite value
the insane form and pose a slightly different problem but essentially the same
it is a clinically established observation that the mind is relatively shallow
below it lies the basic personality of the individual no matter how insane he may be
therefore by one means or another a rational being may be reached within a person a being which is not
it is this fact of which makes the basic personality a difficult aid in diagnosis
here however it can be established what the person really wants what he hopes what he actually feels
it has been observed that no matter what his raving state providing his brain structure is normal and complete the basic personality is entirely sound and sane and will cooperate
after auditing the person will become this strong competent and able personality
the mind when unable to exert itself to its full in the environment of the person will break the person or cause him to lose tone
therefore it is of definite interest to discover what immediately preceded the break of the or what is currently causing him unhappiness
something is dispersing his dynamics
the probability is that he has a chronic in his vicinity
wives husbands mothers fathers superiors
can be the source of such breaking since they turn the purpose of the mind which pretends to desire above all else the best interest of the person back upon the person himself
thus these sources cause the individual to lower back into the tone of the mind apathy or a low tone two
the problem of the fixed person and the problem of the sympathy are both visible in the individual
the identity thought of the mind has taken some part of the personality of some individual in the current environment and referred it to some part of the personality of an individual in the past
the discovery of this identity is one of the principal problems in auditing
the sympathy is of a very specific nature being the effort of the parent or guardian to be kind to a child who is severely hurt
if that parent or guardian has shown the child antagonism prior to the time of the injury the adult is prone to the injury in the presence of the identity personality with whom he is now associated
this causes many somatic ills to present themselves in the present
only the exact words of a sympathy will soothe the personality
there are not many personality types
a human being learns through
if his own self is found to be too painful he can become another self and very often does
a tone four can become another person at will without being about it thus enjoying books and plays by being the person portrayed
but an individual can become part of the cast of his mind and so solve all of his problems in such an fashion
persons are not themselves since they do not possess their own determinism
as has been stated those emotions doubts worries and problems which confront the auditor when attempting to place the in reverie or to work him in that reverie will lead the auditor into the basic content of the mind
there are certain definite manifestations which can be suspected and certain routines which follow every case
every human being has been carried in the womb and every human being has been born
the discovery of the basic on each chain is extremely important
finding the basic is like taking the enemy in the flank
there is nothing before it therefore the end most remote from the adult life of the individual is the end most exposed for the attack of the auditor
in the basic the can see feel hear and freely
when he is returned to later incidents it may be found that he can not do these things no matter how hard the auditor works to enable him to do so
by pursuing the chain up its chronological sequence this ability will be restored
therefore it is necessary first and foremost to locate the basic
this may in some few cases lie later than birth
in the majority of the cases it will be found to lie at or before birth
no discussion is here entered about the ability of the human mind to remember at such remote periods
it can be stated however that when data does exist the time track is opened by pain and antagonism at these extreme points and can be contacted and exhausted
it is with the greatest difficulty that the auditor will find the basic
it is ordinarily quite painful and since the scanning mechanism has as its purpose or one of its purposes the avoidance of pain it will not easily reach them
like the scanning mechanism on a cathode ray tube the scanners of even a very reduced potential analytical mind sweep over skipping and not touching the data on the chain
by various means the auditor must then require the scanners to contact that data and force the data back onto the time track where it can be properly exhausted
light are the best possible approach to a case
when the only is an extremely heavy one or an attempted abortion which by the way are very common the auditor must use a great deal of guile
it can be said that the basic and the beginning of the actual chains is very early before near or during birth is painful and will not be easily contacted
in that few have more than a few hundred serious the task is light when once begun but requires a great deal of imagination and persuasion
a must always be suspected unless birth when lifted rises easily into a tone four
if none of the will rise into a tone four the auditor would suppose that he has not discovered the basic
there are three kinds of the the and the follower
by here is meant that experience which the auditor has found and is working upon
if it does not seem to be lifting after a few a earlier must be suspected and returned to
in this way an earlier basic may be discovered
blows in the womb attempted abortions and birth are the usual basics
easily the most important are the
when a child is abnormally afraid of the dark he probably has a severe experience in
this experience will include all the sound data and sensory data of the incident
it is idiotic and identical
the will have
these on the first few will be ordinarily faint and then become more severe as more data is located
the data will finally be in a more or less complete state and the will begin to lift rising up through the various tones
all are apathy experiences and are therefore serious
minor taps and in the womb are of no consequence
a true will consist of such a thing as a knitting needle being rammed through the half of the head being badly injured blows of various kinds bringing about and so forth
return eventually will find an opening into any period when there has been pain
and antagonisms from the on the subject of such a thing as an attempted abortion should be overlooked by the auditor or taken into account as the sign of an existing
a case is recalled wherein a girl insisted that if an abortion had ever been attempted on her it should have been successful
through several sessions while an attempt was made to lift birth she continued this assertion until the auditor realized that this was probably a remark made by the or the mother when his efforts failed
as soon as this was suggested to the girl she was able to contact the actual incident
a chronic apathy case under treatment for some years in an institution she suddenly responded to auditing brought the abortion to tone four erased birth to tone four and recovered mentally and physically into a social asset well above normal
the auditor should continue to suspect as long as he can not get later easily into tone four
once an chain has been lifted at its end nearest to conception the should begin to release relatively automatically aided but little by the auditor
the should be in terms of laughter at its optimum
this laughter is the reversing of charges residual in the locks which depended for their fear content or antagonistic content upon the basic
abortion attempts are easy to recognize when an auditor has had some experience
the parent who attempted the abortion will after the birth likely be a source of anxiety to the individual who seems to require a great deal of affection and attraction from that parent
the individual will be found to be most fond of the parent or other who did not aid or who actually tried to prevent the abortion attempt
at this time abortion attempts are extremely common
when an abortion attempt has been lifted the chain should easily be brought to the time track and exhausted
auditing is essentially very simple but it demands precise understanding of the principles involved and imagination and sympathy on the part of the auditor
he must learn to compute or learn to think with his analytical mind only for the purposes of auditing others
his biggest problem is the discovery of the basic of basics
it may him for a considerable period of time
there is however preparatory work to do in a case other than the discovery of the basic
occasionally an entire time track must be in which do not remember and cant remember have obscured the track
later locks can be found and exhausted in the same manner that are exhausted and rapid scanning methods may be developed in the future for these
the hysteria or fear of the individual can be momentarily one way or the other and the problem of reaching the basic can be entered upon
there are as many types of case as there are cases but these are the primary fundamentals
an auditor must think his way through every case taking as his data the constantly reiterated statements of the during auditing and accumulating experience as to how incidents can be thrust off the time track them from sight by the analytical mind thus forming a mind to the detriment of the organism
cexhaustion of the technique of exhausting an is not complicated but it must be adhered to
an is an unconscious moment containing physical pain and conceived or actual antagonism to the organism
therefore that before it is discovered will exhibit antagonism toward the auditor trying to discover it
when it is first discovered it may be found to be lacking in its essential data
there are many techniques by which this data can be developed
in a the analytical mind apparently must the situation
many returns through the incident are therefore necessary
when an will not exhaust the first thing the auditor should suspect is an earlier
it is actually possible for a later one to contain essential information which will not permit the information to rise
in the course of auditing when an is by the auditor but will not rise above apathy and does not seem to contain all the necessary data the auditor must look for an earlier and it almost inevitably will be found to exist
this is then developed as the basic
if it follows the same behavior pattern of not lifting or becoming complete another previous to it must be discovered
if at last the auditor is entirely certain that there is no ahead of the one being run some possible locking mechanism later on may be found and exhausted at which time the basic may show itself
continual application of energy to the basic will at length bring it into full view and continual recounting of it will gradually develop it raise its tone and lift it into tone four
the principle of recounting is very simple
the is merely told to go back to the beginning and to tell it all over again
he does this many times
as he does it the should lift in tone on each recounting
it may lose some of its data and gain other
if the is recounting in the same words time after time it is certain that he is playing a memory record of what he has told you before
he must then be sent immediately back to the actual and the of it
he will then be found to somewhat vary his story
he must be returned to the consciousness of continually until these are fully developed begin to and are then gone
tone four will appear shortly afterwards
if the is bored with the incident and refuses to go on with it there is either an earlier or there is other data in the which has not been located
the auditor will discover that occasionally an when lifted into a three or even erased without reaching laughter will sag
this is a certain sign of an earlier basic on that chain
any kind of sag from a tone four is impossible if tone four has truly been reached
tone four will not be reached if there are earlier basics
the may vanish and be erased but there will be no cheerfulness or laughter about it at the end if it is not the basic
once the basic has been reached and brought into tone four it will disappear
the next on the chain will be located and rather easily brought into tone four
if one is accidentally skipped the third in line will be found to hold or sag
the intermediate must then be located and brought into a tone four
in such a way the chain will gradually come up into a complete tone four
at this time the locks the merely mentally painful incidents in the persons life will begin to release automatically
these will erase or lift without any attention from the auditor
while these are releasing the auditor must concern himself with secondary
these would be on their own if they had not had forerunners
they therefore do not relieve after the removal of the basic but must be located as themselves
these in turn will start a chain of releasing locks which again need no attention
there may be entirely distinct chains in the mind which are not appended in any way to the original basic
so long as a retains any part of a mind he will be interested in himself in the condition of his mind and be introverted
therefore so long as he is interested in his own mind he is impeded in his dynamic pursuit of survival
a guarantee of a tone four is the patient interest in positive action along his dynamics and his application of himself to the world around him
is not natural nor is it necessary to the creation of anything
it is a manifestation of the analytical mind trying to solve problems on improper data and observing the organism being engaged in activities which are not conducive to survival along the dynamics
when a clear has been reached the basic personality and of the individual will have asserted itself
no chronic in the present will remain excepting those which can be accounted for by actual disease injury or of the brain
though more germane to child it is of help to the auditor to know that a child can be considered to have formed his general basic purpose in life somewhere around the age of two
this purpose is fairly reliable as at that time his have probably not gained much force over him since his responsibilities are slight
he will have tried to hold his main purpose throughout his life but it will undoubtedly have been warped both by his minds experience content and by his environment
the time when the purpose is formed varies and may indeed never have been manifested as in the case of
as the is normally interested in this purpose and its rehabilitation he will often take a more intense interest in auditing if there is an attempt made to discover it
this purpose is quite valid and the can be expected to his life along its dictates unless he is too oppressed by his environment
it can be remarked that a release or clear will ordinarily order or change his environment
vocational therapies have as their source the of the rehabilitation of the general purpose of an individual or the establishment of a false purpose in order to allay the activity of his mind
it has little bearing on but an auditor for the term of auditing may engage his along the purpose line of becoming a clear
this is not necessary and is indeed often automatic since the basic personality beholds at last a chance to manifest itself
however it will occasionally aid the auditor
the auditor should be prepared to have to solve many individual problems since above the basics are almost as many problems as there are cases
for example in the case of a who has several very nasty it will be found that the formation of the body in the womb has overlaid or confused the time track so that a later must be partially lifted before an earlier can be exhausted
this is often true of a later period of life
in one case an entire series of was held down by a dental operation under oxide at the age of
until some portion of this was removed the bulk of the were not available
in short the circuits of the mind can become to a point where even the motor control time track is confused
dispersal of purpose by some along some dynamic or purpose line is a common situation and is indeed the basic concept
as a stream of electrons would behave if they were to encounter a solid object in their path so does a drive or purpose disperse
these many varied and faint tracks after impact with the are symptomatic
along dynamic two the sexual drive inevitably and invariably indicates a sexual of great magnitude
once that is removed can be expected to cease
anxiety is established in the mind by such and he dramatizes because of the dispersal
this is one of the manifestations of his malady
no ever became a without having been educated or abused by a
and that abuse must have been very thorough
the contagion of is an interesting manifestation which the auditor should and must observe
it can be said that insanity runs in families not because this is a eugenic truth but because a standard patter during emergencies or stress creates certain types of which in turn create types of
are so definitely contagious that when a child is raised by parents the child becomes
as would be delineated by child the best way to guarantee a sane child is to provide it with cleared or released parents
this is of definite interest to the auditor since he will discover that in cases of severe and birth the were also received by the mother exactly as they were received by the child
the child will thereafter be a to the mother and the mother a to the child for the severe incidents
the mother having received the exact wording of the also contains the
by the child will occasion the use of the language toward the child
this brings the infant and child and adolescent into the unhappy situation of having his birth or his continually
this occasions dire results and very great unhappiness in the home and is one of the main sources of family difficulties
a child even if he despises them will dramatize the actions of his parents when he himself is married and when he himself has children
in addition to this the other partner in the marriage also has his or her own
their combine into doubled in the children
the result of this is a contagion and a progression of aberration
thus any society which does not have a high purpose finds itself declining and gaining greater numbers of insane
the contagion of aberration is at work progressively and the children become progressively until at last the society itself is
while the fate of society belongs definitely in social and political the auditor is interested in the fact that he can take the and birth content of the of his and run them to discover locks and secondary
the mother will normally have used much the same data whenever the troubles of the child upon her mind this of course accounts for the locks
the auditor will also discover that where he has a married who is he should have two which is to say the partner
it is useless to return a to his or her spouse and expect domestic tranquility to result
while the release can not and will not pick up his old from the spouse in whom he has implanted them he will never find his life made unbearable by the mere existence of a spouse that he himself may have
further the children of these people will also need auditing since they will be found if the parents aberrations were of any magnitude to be sickly or or deficient in some way
the auditor should therefore when he undertakes a case be prepared to audit the family of his should an investigation of that make it seem necessary
aberrations are contagious and where a person has been his environment will to some degree also have become
the may for one thing be somewhat victimized and impeded by his mind which is now existing in his associates
the auditor should not permit such terms as crazy or mentally exhausted to exist for long in the mind
these are and are actually aberrations in the society
it is true and that the is on his way to being not a person who is crazy or neurotic but an individual who will have more stability and and ability possibly than those around him
to be blunt this is not the process of reviving corpses into a semblance of life
it is a process which at its best usage is taking the normal and average and giving them their birthright of happiness and creative attainment in the world of cengram chains more than one chain will be found in every
when this person becomes a the does well to discover the earliest chain
it is not always possible to do this with accuracy since sometimes in such a nervous condition that he can not be worked on his basic chain but must be in a greater or lesser degree by the exhaustion of a later and more available chain
this last however is not the usual case
the should clearly understand certain working principles and definitions
by an is meant a moment of accompanied by physical pain and conceived antagonism
the basic is the earliest on an chain
also there may be of the same character and kind on the same drive line as the basic of the chain
an chain is composed of a basic and a series of similar incidents
chains also contain locks which are instances of mental anguish more or less known to the analytical mind
these are often mistaken by the for the cause of his conduct
a true is unknown to the conscious computer of the but underlies it as a false datum on which are erected almost equally unknown similar incidents and an enormous number of locks
in order to release an chain it is vital and absolutely necessary to discover the basic of that chain
an individual will have more than one chain but he has a basic chain
this must be released as soon as possible after auditing is begun on the
when an is discovered by the he must examine the aspect of it to determine whether or not it is the basic
discovering it is not he must immediately determine an earlier basic and so forth until he is obviously on the scene of the basic
there are certain tests which he can apply
a basic will rise to laughter sag slightly and then rise to tone four and vanish
successive will then erase from that chain with very little work
almost any on an chain can be exhausted but if it is not a basic it will recede and vanish at times but will rise in part again when the basic has been reached and the is brought forward into its area
an not basic is subject to sag
which is to say that it may be brought to the two point zero
tone but after a certain length of time has elapsed from one to two days it will be found to have sagged and to be for instance in a one point one
tone
it can be successively lifted until it is apparently in a three point zero
tone at which point much of its content will disappear
this is reduction
any chain can be reduced to some degree without reaching the basic but when it has been reached the basic itself and subsequent can be brought rapidly to tone four providing no are skipped on the return up the time track
when an chain has been brought to tone four it can be considered to have vanished
the can no longer find it on the time track he may even be unable to recall some of its most painful and disheartening aspects
the mind apparently has been against the data it has contained
a search for an chain after it has been exhausted and a tone four has been achieved should for purposes of auditing be entirely fruitless
once the basic has been discovered and the chain has been brought to tone four the locks will vanish of their own accord
if this does not occur then there is something remaining or the auditor has been too optimistic about the selection of his basic for the chain and has not in reality discovered it
all chains should be exhausted from a
these may be discovered to lie along the various dynamics but any chain may influence more than one dynamic
another type of is the cross
this is usually a childhood or adult which embraces more than one chain
the receipt of the cross containing as it does the of two or more chains is often accompanied by a nervous breakdown or the sudden insanity of an individual
a cross may occur in a severe accident in prolonged or severe illness under antagonistic circumstances or a oxide operation
cross are very easy to locate but should not be addressed by the as such since an enormous amount of work upon them will not exhaust them until the basic and the chains on which the cross depends have been brought to tone four
is almost always traceable to the receipt of a cross
this must be of course an in its own right on more than one chain
it is conceivable that it may be so severe that it breaks the individual even if it lies on only one chain
there are certain rules the may employ to establish the basic of a chain
in first entering a case these rules apply as well to the first goal which is the location of the basic of the basic chain
number one no will lift if the basic of that chain has not been lifted
number two the basic will not lift until the basic instant of the basic has been reached which is to say the first moment of the
ordinarily this is the most number three if after two or three test of an it does not seem to be improving the auditor should attempt to discover an earlier
number four no is valid unless accompanied by somatic pain
this may be mild
incidents which do not contain are either not basic the chain having been suspended by some such command as cant feel in the basic or else it may not even be an cases should be entered as near as possible to the basic
then they should be returned to earlier incidents until the basic is discovered
the running of locks themselves may accomplish some alleviation of a case
c
birth and infant the human mind and the human anatomy are enormously more powerful and than has commonly been supposed
only incidents of the greatest magnitude in physical pain and hostile content are sufficient to a mind
the ability of the mind to store data can scarcely be overrated
in early life before sound is analyzed as speech a human being receives and stores exact impressions of everything which occurs
at some future date when similar are encountered the mind on the basis of identities only the content of the early mind
this becomes the foundation of the personality
the actual personality in the individual is powerful and very difficult to
unlike animals which can be driven mad by minor mechanisms of experimental psychology a man must be most severely handled before he begins to show any signs of derangement
that derangement proceeds from the ability of the mind to store perceptions from the earliest moments of existence and retain them on either the analytical or the plane for future reference
the basic personality does not proceed from and the dynamics of the individual are impeded not enhanced by
the dynamics are entirely separate and are as native to the individual as his basic personality of which they are a part
information falls into two categories the educational or experience level banked and available to the analytical mind on at least its deeper levels and or data stored in the mind and often used but never reached by the analytical mind save through auditing
there would seem to be two types of recording
the first is cellular recording in which the cells would seem to store data
in that cells in become themselves again which is to say that when cell a divides both halves are still cell a cellular intelligence is not lost
personal identity is duplicated
in the case of individual men procreation is far more complex and individual identity is lost the son is not the father but a genetic composite of vast numbers of ancestors
the cells of the human being shortly after conception are capable of enormous and retentive power
after a very short time in the womb the brain and nervous system are already operating
from then until birth the human being is apparently capable of computations of a rather complex nature on the analytical mind level
far more certainly he retains information on the level
fear pain and extend the range of perception of the individual
when the human being in the womb is injured his senses extend so as to record sounds outside the mothers body
he records them so well that their precise nature is stored for future reference
the human being in the womb responds exactly as it does after birth to the receipt of storing the data with precision and reacting to it
the repair facilities available to a human being before birth are greatly enhanced by the presence of ample connective tissue oxygen and sustenance
these repair facilities are great so that a human being can be severely torn and ripped without becoming structurally deficient
it does however receive and these are subject to
in many cases of attempted abortions it was found that large sections of the human beings brain could apparently be injured without the brain being deficient or even scarred after birth
these repair facilities do not however lessen the extreme severity of the which can be received by the human being
the word is dropped at this point and it is advised that it should be dropped from the language as a description of a human being
insufficient evidence is at hand to make an outright declaration that attempted abortions are responsible for the bulk of our criminal and insane
but according to the cases at hand the attempted abortion must be accounted responsible for the majority
the attempted abortion is the most serious aberration producer
so exact is the recording of the human being that the mind makes no errors in recognizing its enemies after birth
the mind becomes in having to depend upon these same enemies for the ordinary sustenance of life while the child is a helpless infant
the diagnosis of a case is relatively simple
nearly all will be found to have at least one and the case will not solve unless that is reached and exhausted
the can usually establish the attempted abortion by an investigation of the conduct of the infant and child
uneasiness or unhappiness in the home a feeling of not being wanted unreasonable fear and a strong attachment to grandparents or another member of the household are often signs of an attempted abortion
fear of the dark is usually but not always a part of the attempted abortion case
the auditor should suspect an abortion attempt in every he at least for this next generation
whether or not the disbelieves the diagnosis is of no importance to the auditor as the may very well contain the words cant believe it
the parents themselves as well as society the individual as to the enormous prevalence of this practice at this time
the attempted abortion may not be discovered to be such until considerable auditing has already been done
any auditing done on an attempted abortion unless it is solely addressed to making the case workable is wasted until the attempted abortions are reached
the presents a somewhat different case than the since his case can be entered at any point and the earliest moments of it can be attained easily
this is not true of the attempted abortion
attempted abortions may run to any number
since they are easily the most prevalent dramatization of in the society they are repeated time and again
the auditor will find it necessary to the period
he will ordinarily reach the latest injury first
as he finds and examines it it places itself on the time track
by going to earlier and earlier attempts more and more of these are revealed until at last the earliest is discovered
the auditor must be prepared to spend many hours of hard work in injuries
he will many times believe that he has reached the basic of that chain only to discover that another type of abortion was attempted prior to that moment
he need not address these for any length of time before he goes on to the earlier one
he should only get some idea of them so that they will be easily on the return
the basic on the attempted abortion case may be found shortly after the first missed period of the mother
its emotion will be exactly that of the person or persons attempting to perform the abortion
the human being identifies himself with himself but an adult returned to the period is the data and will find that he has and is confusing himself with other people associated in the attempts
this data may have slumbered for years before it became violently and may indeed never have been awakened
it must be removed however before a release can be obtained
the auditor should be prepared to fifty or more incidents before birth if necessary
when he is at last in the vicinity of the basic even the most skeptical one who has skepticism as part of the chains will have no further question as to what is happening to him
the auditor should be prepared to encounter difficulty in the ability of the to hear voices or feel pain as it is quite common for the content to contain such phrases as unconscious and cant see cant feel cant hear this having been the misconception of the society regarding life
the auditor should never be appalled at the damage the human being has received and so question the validity of his data
unless the cord is severed or the heart is stopped it is apparently the case that no damage particularly in the earlier months is too great for the organism to reconstruct
in that parents performing abortions are usually dramatizing attempted abortions which have been performed on them rationality of content in the should not be expected
even the data given for it by the father mother or professional is often entirely inaccurate
the test of an is whether or not it will lift and whether or not the which accompanied it disappear and a tone four is obtained
rearranging data into other sequences will not obtain this
the exact content must be brought out
the attempted abortion human being is often struck unconscious by the earliest part of each attempt since the head is so available to the knitting needles hat pins sticks and so forth which are employed
these periods of must be penetrated and will quite ordinarily release slowly
the number of should not particularly the auditor for when the basic has been discovered and a tone four achieved the succeeding experiences will lift with greater and greater ease
the periods of consciousness interspersed between the being locks will vanish
birth is in itself a severe experience and is recorded by the human being from the first moments of pain throughout the entire experience
everything in a birth is since the human being conceives the ministrations to be more or less antagonistic when they are accompanied by so much pain
a birth must be lifted as a matter of course but not until the presence or absence of has been established
even after birth has been lifted should be looked for since may often be found only after birth has been exhausted
the habits of the presence of sound and speech in the delivery room the of an infants nostrils the examination of its mouth the severe treatment administered to start its breathing and the drops on the eyes may account in themselves for many psychosomatic ills
a cough however although it is present in birth and seems to be by the exhaustion of the birth is quite ordinarily blood running down the throat of the during an attempted abortion
any perception during birth when difficulty is encountered with breathing may become a for asthma
clean fresh air and electric lights may cause allergies and may be the principal
everything said during birth as well as everything said during experiences is recorded in the mind and acts as matter which can and does cause psychological and physiological changes in the individual
because the parents are not greatly in evidence at birth this experience may not be for many years
on the other hand more easily
infant life is very sentient
delay in learning to talk is delay in learning the complexity of handling vocal muscles rather than an inability to record
everything in infant life is recorded and the received in it are extremely valid
the auditor will find himself dealing mainly with birth and infant life
the cases are very rare which have many important basics in childhood or adult life
these last periods contain mainly other which though they must be addressed to create the release should not engage much initial attention on the part of the
most of the experiences of mental anguish in childhood and adult life are founded on very early and are locks which are almost
moments of which contain physical pain and conceived antagonism lying in childhood and adult life are serious and can produce aberration
chains complete with basic may be found which will all by themselves exhaust
cthe laws of returning by aberration is meant the reactions to and difficulties with his current environment
by somatic is meant any physical or physically sensory which the generally or in his environment or any such manifestation encountered and re experienced during auditing
the aberration is the mental error caused by and the somatic is the physical error occasioned by the same source
the auditor follows the general rule that no aberrations or exist in a subject which can not be accounted for by
he may ordinarily be expected to discover that anything which reduces the physical or mental perfection of the subject is
he applies this rule first and in practice admits no organic trouble of any character
only when he has obviously obtained a clear and when he has observed and has had that clear medically examined after a period of sixty days to six months from the end of auditing should he be content to assign anything to organic origin
he can not be expected to know until the final examination exactly what somatic was not
in other words he must persistently adhere to one line of thought that the can be brought to mental and physical perfection before he resigns any mental or physical error in the to a purely organic category
too little is known at this writing of the of the mind and body for a to deny that ability to recover
since primary research considerable practice has demonstrated that this ability to reconstruct and recover is enormous far beyond anything previously conceived possible
accounts for all faith healing phenomena on an entirely scientific basis and the can expect himself to daily in his practice with what appear to be miracles
in addition to knowledge of his subject considerable intelligence and imagination and a personality which inspires confidence the auditor must possess to a remarkable degree
in other words his drives must be high
there is no substitute for the auditors having been cleared
it is possible for an individual to operate with without having been released and he may do so for some time without but as he he will most certainly encounter the contained in of his own time after time until these are so that he will become mentally or physically ill in psychoanalysis it was possible for the analyst to escape this fate because he dealt primarily with locks occurring in the life
the analyst might even experience relief from operating on patients since it might clarify his own locks which always had been more or less completely available to his analytical mind
this is very far from the case with the who handles continually the vital and highly charged data which cause physical and mental aberrations
an auditor in may work with impunity for a very short time only before his own condition demands that he himself be audited
while this is aside from the main subject of auditing it has been too often observed to be neglected
every possesses some quality which denies it to the analytical mind
there are several types
first there is the which contains the species of phrase frank will never know about this forget it can not remember it and so forth
second is the which contains the phrases never happened cant believe it possibly imagine it and so on
third is the which contains the species of phrase cant stay here get out and other phrases which will not permit the to remain in its vicinity but return him to present time
a fourth is the holder which contains stay here hold still cant get out and so on
these are four of the general types which the will find occasion him the greatest difficulty
the type of phrase being encountered however is easily diagnosed from reaction
there are many other types of and phrases which will be encountered
there is the which implies that it will always be this way and it happens all the time
the auditor will soon learn to recognize them forming lists of his own
an would not be an unless it had strong compulsive or repressive data contained in it
all are to some degree being well off the time track and touching it slightly if at all with some minor and apparently bit of information which the analytical mind as unimportant
classed with the variety are those phrases which deny perception of any kind
the auditor will continually encounter perception denial and will find it one of the primary reasons the can not recall and articulate the
cant see cant hear cant feel and alive tend to deny the whole containing any such phrases
as the is a powerful of physical pain it will without any phrases whatsoever deny itself to the analytical mind which in seeking to scan the is repelled by the operating principle that it must avoid pain for the organism
as has already been covered there are five ways the organism can handle a source of pain
it can neglect it attack it succumb to it flee from it or avoid it
as the entire organism handles exterior pain sources so does the analytical mind tend to react to
there is an exterior world reaction of the organism to pain sources then
this is approximated when the analytical mind is addressed in regard to
there is an excellent reason for this
everything contained in the mind is exterior source material
the analytical mind went out of circuit and was recording imperfectly if at all in the time period when the exterior source was entered into the mind
an analytical mind when asked to approach an reacts as it would have had it been present which is to say in circuit at the moment when the was being received
therefore an artificial approach to the must be made which will the auditor to direct the subjects analytical mind into but one source of action attack
the actual incident must be located and
in that the analytical mind has five possible ways of reacting to the and in that the auditor desires that only one of these attack be used the must be persuaded from using the remaining four
on this general principle can be created many types of approach to the problem of obtaining a clear
the one which is offered in this manual is that one which has met with quicker and more predictable results than others at this time
it has given in use one hundred per cent results
in the beginning at this time an auditor should not attempt to stray far from this offered technique
he should attempt to vary it only when he himself has had extensive and sufficient practice which will enable him to be very conversant with the nature of
better techniques will undoubtedly be established which will provide exhaustion of the mind
the offered technique has produced results in all types of cases so far encountered
there are three equations which demonstrate how and why the auditor and can reach and exhaust them i the auditors dynamics are equal to or less than the in the
 the dynamics are less than the
 the auditors dynamics plus the dynamics are greater than the
when the dynamics are entirely or almost entirely reduced as in the case of trance drug trances and so forth the auditors dynamics are not always sufficient to force the analytical mind into an attack upon the
the auditors dynamics directed against an in a who has not been subjected to a process which will inhibit the free play of his mind and concentrate it ordinarily provokes the into one of the four methods of succumbing fleeing avoiding or neglecting the
demanding that the face reality or see reason or that he stop his foolish actions falls precisely into this category
the auditors dynamics operating against an awake can produce an insanity break temporary or of considerable duration in the
when the is in reverie some of his own dynamics are present and the auditors dynamics added to these make a combination sufficient to overcome the
if the auditor releases his dynamics against the analytical mind of the which is to say the person of the while an attempt is being made to reach an in violation of the auditors code or with some erroneous idea that the whole person of the is confronting him he will receive in return all the fury of the
an can be innumerable times for such is the character of the mind that the of the can not exhaust itself and will not exhaust itself regardless of its age or the number of times until it has been approached by the analytical mind of the subject
the additive dynamic drive law must be made to apply before are reached
it is occasionally very necessary to change auditors for some will work well only with either a male or a female auditor or with one or another individual auditor
this will not be found necessary in many cases
three cases are on record where the was definitely anti pathetic toward the auditor throughout the entire course of auditing
the was found to be a for one or more of the persons contained in the
even so these persons responded
greater patience was required on the part of the auditor
closer observance of the auditors code was necessary and a longer time was required for auditing
it will be discovered that once the understands what is desired of him and why his basic personality is aroused to the extent that it will cooperate with any auditor in order to be free
it will suffer through many violations of the auditors code
once a has started his auditing he will ordinarily continue to cooperate in the major requirements to the fullest extent no matter what apparent antagonisms he may display in minor matters
reverie is a method that has been used with success
the analytical mind of the while reduced in its potential and under direction is still capable of thinking its own thoughts and forming its own opinions
implicit obedience to whatever the auditor suggests is not desirable as the will inject extraneous material at the faintest suggestion of the auditor
drugs inhibit the somatic and have no use in entering a case
the fact that the is interested solely in what has been done to the and is not at all interested in what the himself has done to others greatly facilitates auditing since there is no social disgrace in having been an unwitting victim
in reverie the is placed in a light state of concentration which is not to be confused with hypnosis
in the state of alliance therefore the mind of the will be found to be to some degree detachable from his surroundings and directed
the first thing that the will discover in most is aberration of the sense of time
there are various ways that he can this and construct a time track along which he can cause the mind to travel
various early experiences which are easily reached are examined and an early diagnosis can be formed
then begins an immediate effort to reach basic with attempted abortion or accident predominating
failures on the first attempts to reach experiences should not discourage the auditor since many hours may be consumed and many false basics reached and exhausted before the true basic is attained
in this type of reverie the can use and will observe certain apparently natural laws in force
they are as follows the difficulties the analytical mind encounters when returned to or searching for an are identical to the command content of that
an in adult life is more or less obeying as the composite experiences contained in his
the behavior in reverie is regulated by the commands contained in the to which he is returned and is by the composite of chronologically preceding on his time track
the of a are at their highest in an where they were received and at the moment of reception in that experience
when returned to a point prior to an the commands and of that are not effective on the
as he is returned to the moment of an the experiences as the common of all a considerable lessening of his analytical potential
he speaks and acts in a modified version of the
all complaints he makes to the auditor should be regarded as possibly being verbatim from first the that he is or second from prior
at the precise moment of an command the experiences obedience to that command
the emotion a experiences when to an is identical to the emotional tone of that
excesses of emotion will be found to be contained in the word content of the as commands
when a is returned to before the moment of reception of an he is not subject to any part of that emotionally or
when the time track is found to contain loops or is blurred in any portion its crossings or confusions are directly attributable to commands which precisely state the confusion
any difficulty a may experience with returning reaching perceiving or recounting is directly and precisely commanded by
an would not be an were it easy to reach or if it gave the no difficulty and contained no physical pain
the characteristic of is confusion
first the confusion of the time track second the confusion of an chain wherein similar words or mix incidents third confusion of incidents with
this confusion is occasioned by the disconnected state of the analytical mind during the receipt of the
auditing by location and identification of hidden incidents first rebuilds at least the early part of the time track and in relation to one another in time and then the basic of the basic chain and exhausts it
the remainder of the chain must also be exhausted
other and incidents exhaust with ease after the of the basic or the basic of any chain within that chain
locks vanish without being located
a tone four gained on basic permits the subsequent on the time track to go forward with ease
a whole chain may rise to four without the basic chain having been located
any perception of life during reverie denotes the existence of experience as far back as the time track is open
if the individuals general tone is clearly not tone four if he is still interested in his another more basic chain than the one found still exists
patterns tend to form an avoidance pattern for the
from basic outward there is an observable and progressive divergence between the person himself and his returned self
in the basic of the basic chain and for a few subsequent incidents on that chain he will be found within and receiving the experiences as himself
in subsequent incidents cleavage is observable and in late the is found to be observing the action from outside of himself almost as a disinterested party
this forms the principal primary test for the basic of the basic chain
another test for basic is sag
any may be exhausted to a point where it will recede without reaching tone four
although it is temporarily and momentarily lost to the individual and apparently does not trouble him that which has been exhausted in a chain without the basic having been reached will sag or reappear within to sixty hours
basic on any chain will not sag but will lift on a number of rise to tone four and will remain erased
another test for basic is whether or not it begins to lift with ease
if an does not intensify or remain static after many it can be conceived to be at least a basic on some chain
locks will lift and disappear without returning as they are not fixed by physical pain
large numbers of locks can be exhausted bringing an alleviation of the difficulties and such a course may occasionally be pursued in the entrance of a case
the discovery and lifting of the basic to which the locks are appended removes the locks automatically
these rules and laws even if in their statement will be found invariable
incompetent auditing can not be excused by the supposed discovery of a special case or exception
a physical derangement must be in the category of actually missing parts of the organism which cause permanent disability and instances of this are not common
case histories the following case histories have been selected at random
due to lack of time these case histories are releases not clears
the releases have been fully diagnosed and

birth was discovered immediately but would not satisfactorily release
the experienced great difficulty in and his aberrations intensified during auditing
by use of dreams and of the was able to reach the beginning of the chain as counted backwards from birth
fifteen experiences were
they were found lying in two loops
the loops were corrected and the basic of the basic chain was reached
a loop is a of the time track back on itself
in this case incidents are not in their correct place on the time track
the basic consisted of a severe quarrel between his mother and father with several abdominal blows being received by the mother
the mother was protesting that it would make her sick all of her life
at the same time the mother was coughing from a throat blow
the father was insisting that he was master in his own home and that people had to do what he told them
this quarrel occurred at about four and a half months after conception and resulted in the temporary paralysis of the right side
the remainder of the chain consisted of similar incidents evidently on the part of the father of his own as the words used were almost identical one to the next
this chain accounted for and relieved the subjects fear that he would be ill and his desire to tyrannize others
birth was then found to consist of near suffocation and considerable antagonism between the doctor and the nurse
this was registered as commands to himself to the effect that he was blind and could not see
birth was in the home and dust the smell of clean sheets and greased metal were the for this severe lung irritation
this birth was not until the age of five and the were not until entrance into the service when the need for authority manifested itself
no locks were found to need attention and only one half hour of his war experience failed to release that being a new basic

she had done very badly in school engaged in sexual escapades afterwards into an illness which was variously diagnosed
case was entered with ease
birth was reached and would not exhaust
a search for was for ten hours fruitless until certain were artificially and intensified to the point that the had to recall the incident to find relief
eight were then and only two incidents were discovered in confusion with each other held together with a head somatic
the basic proved to be a mutual abortion attempt by the mother and father
the mother said she would die if anyone found out but that she would probably die anyway
the father said that the baby was probably like her and that he want it
eighteen of the head throat and shoulders with a long orange wood stick probably in the third month
several similar incidents completed this chain
followed each attempt at abortion
another incident proved to be a basic without a chain and with innumerable locks an attempted abortion by a professional who used some form of needle and
birth was found to be a mild experience
three infant with their own basic were discovered
they consisted of the mothers fear over the injury and the fear that the baby would die
contagion of attempted abortion was particularly manifest in the mothers neurotic dwelling on fear of death which was obviously a dramatization
all neurotic and psychotic symptoms were relieved with a marked improvement in the health of the and an increase of points on the army test

the subject was extremely cooperative with the
birth was found and exhausted without improvement in the case
a number of infant and childhood were discovered and tested
continual address of the attention to life finally brought about a in which terror and rage alternated
the was able to induce the to listen to the voices he was hearing and to go through with the experience
the proved to be twenty nearer birth than the basic which lay on another chain and which was discovered by dream technique
the was caused by the dramatization of an involving the injection of turpentine into the by the mother in an attempted abortion
the main chain consisted of the mothers efforts to herself
from content it was gathered that the mother was a prostitute for as many as twenty experiences of succeeded two of these abortion attempts
they were too numerous to be evaluated
the basic chain contained many quarrels about money between the mother and her customers
the of this chain were largely bruises and caused by the mother ramming herself into pointed objects or beating her stomach and abdomen
there were many loops in the basic chain caused by the similarity of incident and the confusion of with abortion attempts
the basic incident was at last discovered and exhausted
it was found to lie about twenty days after conception when the mother first discovered her pregnancy
all were exhausted in the basic chain
the was fully cleared and birth was suddenly found to have been a very painful experience particularly because the child was taken by others immediately after birth
only one chain resulting from fist fights was found in childhood
ever since i was nine years old i have had but one passion motor racing
i founded a specialist motor sport magazine in simply to be able to live in the environment of a sport where man is constantly trying to surpass himself while striving to surpass others
since my early childhood i had dreamed of one day being a driver following in the footsteps of someone as famous as
thanks to contacts made through the magazine i founded i was given the opportunity to race and about ten trophies now adorn my apartment as a result of those races
on the of however i went to a volcano overlooking in central southern
i went more to get a breath of fresh air than to take a drive in my car
my legs were itching after a full year following the races from circuit to circuit almost always living on four wheels so to speak
the air was cool at the time and the sky rather gray with a background mist
i walked and a little and left the path where my car was parked aiming to reach the center of the crater called where i often went for picnics with my family in the what a superb and breathtaking place it was to think that thousands of years ago right where my feet were standing lava had out at incredibly high temperatures
decorative volcanic bombs can still be found among the debris
the vegetation resembled that of province in but without sunshine
i f t he i was just about to leave and looked for the last time towards the top of the circular mountain which was formed by an accumulation of volcanic
it reminded me how many times i had slid down those steep slopes as if i was on skis
suddenly in the fog i saw a red light flashing then a sort of helicopter was descending towards me
a helicopter however makes a noise but at that moment i could hear absolutely nothing not even the slightest whistle
a balloon maybe site of first encounter de near
t he e by now the object was about twenty meters above the ground and i could see it had a somewhat flattened shape
it was a flying
i had always believed in their existence but i had never dreamed i would actually see one
it measured some seven meters in diameter about
meters in height was flat underneath and
on its underside a very bright red light flashed while at the top an intermittent white light reminded me of a camera flash cube
this white light was so intense that i could not look at it without the object continued to descend without the slightest noise until it stopped and hovered motionless about two meters above the ground
i was petrified and remained absolutely still
i was not afraid but rather filled with joy to be living through such a great moment
i bitterly regretted not having brought my camera with me
then the incredible happened
a trap door opened beneath the machine and a kind of stairway unfolded to the ground
i realized that some living being was about to appear and i wondered what it was going to look like
first two feet appeared then two legs which reassured me a little since apparently i was about to meet a man
in the event what at first i took to be a child came down the stairway and walked straight towards me
i could see then this was certainly no child even though the figure was only about four feet
meters tall
his eyes were slightly shaped his hair was black and long and he had a small black beard
i still had not moved and he stopped about ten meters away he wore some sort of green suit which covered his entire body and although his head seemed to be exposed i could see around it a strange sort of halo
it was not really a halo but the air about his face shone slightly and
it looked like an invisible shield like a bubble so fine that you could barely see it
his skin was white with a slightly greenish a bit like someone with liver trouble
i f t he he smiled faintly and i thought it best to return his smile
i felt rather ill at ease so i smiled and bowed my head slightly in greeting
he answered with the same gesture
thinking that i had to find out if he could hear me i asked where do you come from he answered in a strong articulate voice that was slightly nasal from very far away
do you speak i enquired
i speak all the languages of the earth
do you come from another planet yes he replied
as he spoke he moved closer and stopped about two meters from is this the first time you have visited the earth oh no have you been here often very often to say the least
why did you come here today to talk to you
to me yes to you editor of a small motor sport magazine married and father of two children
how do you know all that we have been watching you for a long time
why me this is precisely what i want to tell you
why did you come here on this cold winter morning i know  i felt like walking in the fresh air  do you come here often in the summer yes but almost never in this season
so why did you come today had you planned this walk for a long no
i really know
when i woke up this morning i suddenly had an urge to come here
you came because i wanted to see you
do you believe in telepathy t he e yes of course its something always been interested in as well as the subject of flying saucers
but i never thought see one myself
well i used telepathy to get you to come here because i have many things to tell you
have you read the yes but why do you ask have you been reading it for a long time no as a matter of fact i bought it only a few days ago
i really know
suddenly i had an urge to read it  again i used telepathy to make you decide to buy it
i have chosen you for a very difficult mission and i have many things to tell you
so come into my craft where we can talk more comfortably
i followed him climbing up the small staircase beneath the machine which on closer inspection looked more like a flattened bell with a full and bulging underside
inside it two seats faced one another and the temperature was mild even though the door was still there was no lamp but natural light emanated from everywhere
there were no instruments like those you find in an aircraft cockpit
the floor was made of a sparkling alloy which was slightly bluish
the chairs were colorless and translucent but very comfortable and made from one piece of material
i sat on the larger one that was set closer to the floor so that the face of the little man sitting in front of me was at the same level as mine
he touched a spot on the wall and the whole machine became transparent except for its top and bottom
it was like being in the open air but the temperature was mild
he invited me to take off my coat which i did and then he started to speak
you regret not having brought your camera so that you could have talked about our meeting to the whole world with proof in your yes of course  listen to me carefully
you will tell human beings about this meeting but you will tell them the truth about what they are and about what we are
judging from their reactions we will know if we i f t he can show ourselves freely and officially
wait until you know everything before you start speaking publicly
then you will be able to defend yourself properly against those people who will not believe you and you will be able to bring them incontestable proof
you will write down everything i tell you and publish the writings as a book
but why did you choose me for many reasons
first of all we needed someone in a country where new ideas are welcomed and where it is possible to talk about such ideas openly
democracy was born in and this country has a reputation the world over for being the country of freedom
also we needed someone who is intelligent and quite open to everything
above all we needed someone who is a free thinker without being
because you were born of a father and a mother we consider you to be an ideal link between two very important peoples in the history of the world
besides your activities do not in any way you to making incredible revelations and this will make your words all the more credible
since you are not a scientist you will not complicate things and will explain them simply
not being a literary man you wont compose elaborate sentences which are difficult to read for a great many people
finally we decided to choose someone who was born after the first atomic explosion in and you were born in
we have in fact been following you since your birth and even before
this is why we have chosen you
do you have any other questions where do you come from from a distant planet about which i will tell you nothing for fear that men of the earth might be unwise enough to disturb our peace
is your planet very far away very far
when i tell you the distance you will understand that it is impossible to reach it with your present level of scientific and technical knowledge
what are you called we are people like you and we live on a planet similar to earth
how long does it take you to come here as long as it takes to think about it
t he e why do you come to earth to monitor and watch over the development of humanity
human beings on earth are the future we are the past
are there many people on your planet there are more people than on yours
i would like to visit your planet
can i no
first of all you live there because the atmosphere is different from yours and you have not been trained for such a journey
but why meet here because the crater of a volcano is an ideal place away from irksome people
i shall leave you now
come back tomorrow at the same time with the and something to take notes with
do not bring any metallic object and speak to no one of our conversation otherwise we will never meet again
he handed me my coat let me climb down the ladder and waved his hand
the ladder folded up and the door closed without a sound
still without making the slightest murmur or any whistling sound the craft rose gently to a height of about meters then disappeared into the mist
he following day i was at the meeting place again as arranged with a notebook a pen and the
the flying machine reappeared on time and i found myself face to face once more with the little man who invited me to enter the machine and sit in the same comfortable chair
i had spoken to nobody about all this not even to those closest to me and he was happy to learn that i had been discreet
he suggested i take notes and then he started to speak a very long time ago on our distant planet we had reached a level of technical and scientific knowledge comparable to that which you will soon reach
our scientists had started to create primitive embryonic forms of life namely living cells in test tubes
everyone was thrilled by this
the scientists perfected their techniques and began creating bizarre little animals but the government under pressure from public opinion ordered the scientists to stop their experiments for fear they would create monsters which would become dangerous to society
in fact one of these animals had broken loose and killed several people
since at that time interplanetary and explorations had also made progress the scientists decided to set out for a distant planet where they could find most of the necessary conditions to pursue their experiments
they chose earth where you live
now i t he t g would like you to refer to the where you will find traces of the truth about your past
these traces of course have been somewhat distorted by successive who could not conceive of such high technology and could therefore only explain what was described as being a mystical and supernatural force
only the parts of the that i will translate are important
other parts are merely poetic of which i will say nothing
i am sure you can appreciate that thanks to the law which said that the had always to be recopied without changing even the smallest detail the deepest meaning has remained intact throughout the ages even if the text has been with mystical and futile so let us start with the first chapter of the book of genesis in the beginning created the heaven and the earth
genesis
translated without justification in some bibles by the word god means in those who came from the sky and furthermore the word is a
it means that the scientists from our world searched for a planet that was suitable to carry out their projects
they created or in reality discovered the earth and realized it contained all the necessary elements for the creation of artificial life even if its atmosphere was not quite the same as our and the spirit of moved upon the face of the waters
genesis
this means the scientists made reconnaissance flights and what you might call artificial satellites were placed around the earth to study its constitution and atmosphere
the earth was at that time completely covered with water and thick mist
i f t he and saw the light that it was good
genesis
to create life on earth it was important to know whether the sun was sending harmful rays to the surface and this question was fully
it turned out that the sun was heating the earth correctly without sending out harmful rays
in other words the light was good
and the evening and the morning were the first day
genesis
this research took quite some time
the day mentioned here corresponds to the period in which your sun rises under the same sign on the day of the vernal in other words about years and made the and divided the waters which were under the from the waters which were above the
genesis
after studying the cosmic rays above the clouds the scientists descended below the clouds but stayed above the waters
that means they were between the clouds the waters which were above the and the ocean covering the whole planet the waters which were under the
let the waters under the heaven be gathered together unto one place and let the dry land appear
genesis
after they studied the surface of the ocean they studied the sea bed and determined that it was not very deep and fairly even everywhere
so then by means of fairly strong which acted rather like they raised matter from the bottom of the seas and piled it up into one place to form a continent
t he t g originally there was on earth only one continent and your scientists have recently acknowledged that all the continents which have drifted apart over many years used to fit perfectly into one another to form one land mass
let the earth bring forth grass the herb yielding seed and the fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind whose seed is in itself upon the earth
genesis
in this magnificent and gigantic laboratory they created vegetable cells from nothing other than chemicals which then produced various types of plants
all their efforts were aimed at reproduction
the few blades of grass they created had to reproduce on their own
the scientists spread out across this immense continent in small research teams
every individual created different varieties of plants according to their inspiration and the climate
they met up at regular intervals to compare their research and their creations
the people back on their own planet followed their progress from afar with passion and amazement
the most brilliant artists came and joined the scientists in order to give some plants purely decorative and pleasing roles either through their appearance or their perfume
let there be lights in the of the heaven to divide the day from the night and let them be for signs and for seasons and for days and years
genesis
by observing the stars and the sun they could measure the duration of the days the months and the years on earth
this helped them regulate their life on the new planet so different from their own where days and years did not have the same duration
research in astronomy enabled them to locate themselves precisely and to understand the earth better
i f t he let the waters abound with an abundance of living creatures and let birds fly above the earth across the face of the of the heavens
genesis
next they created the first animals from to small fish then very large fish
they also created seaweed to balance this little world so that the small fish could feed on it and the bigger fish could eat the small fish in turn
thus a natural balance would be established and one species would not destroy another species in order to survive
this is what you now refer to as and that was achieved successfully
the scientists and artists met often and organized to determine which team had created the most beautiful or most interesting animals
after the fish they created birds
this was done under pressure it must be said from the artists who went out of their way to create the most stunning forms with the colors
some of them had great trouble flying because their beautiful feathers were very cumbersome
the contests went even further embracing not only physical characteristics but also the behavior of these animals particularly the wonderful dances of their mating rituals
some other groups of scientists created frightful animals veritable monsters which proved right those people who had opposed the creation plans on their own planet
these were dragons or what you call dinosaurs and
let the earth bring forth the living creature according to its kind cattle and creeping thing and beast of the earth each according to its kind
genesis
after marine organisms and birds the scientists created land animals on a planet where the vegetation had by now become magnificent
there was plenty of food for the
these were the first land animals which were created
later they created t he t g to balance the population
here too the species had to maintain equilibrium
those scientists who did all this came from the same planet as me
i am one of those people who created life on earth
it was at that time that the most skillful among us wanted to create an artificial human being like ourselves
each team set to work and very soon we were able to compare our creations
but on our home planet people were outraged when they heard that we were making test tube children who might come to threaten their world
they feared that these new human beings could become a danger if their mental capacities or powers turned out to be superior to those of their creators
so we had to agree to leave the new humans to live in a very primitive way without letting them know anything scientific and we mystified our actions
it is easy to work out how many teams of creators did this each race on earth corresponds to a team of let us make man in our image according to our likeness let them have dominion over the fish of the sea over the birds of the air and over the cattle over all the earth and over every creeping thing that creeps on the earth
genesis
in our image you can see that the resemblance is striking
that is when the trouble started for us
the team located in the country you now call which at the time was not far from and turkey on the original continent was composed of brilliant creators who were perhaps the most talented team of all
their animals were the most beautiful and their plants had the sweetest perfumes
this was what you call paradise on earth
the human beings they created there were the most intelligent
so steps had to be taken to ensure that they did not surpass their creators
the created therefore had to be kept in ignorance of the great scientific secrets while being educated for the purpose of measuring their intelligence
i f t he of every tree of the garden you may freely eat but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil you shall not eat for in the day that you eat of it you shall surely die genesis
this means you the created can learn all you want read all of the books that we have here at your disposal but never touch the scientific books otherwise you will die
he brought them to the man to see what he would name them
genesis
human beings had to have a thorough understanding of the plants and animals living around them their way of life and the way to get food from them
the creators taught them the names and the powers of everything that existed around them since botany and zoology were not considered dangerous for them
imagine the joy of this team of scientists having two children a male and a female running around eagerly learning what was being taught to them
the serpent  said unto the woman  of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden  ye shall not surely die for know that in the day ye eat thereof then your eyes shall be opened and ye shall be like
genesis
some scientists in this team felt a deep love for their little human beings their creatures and they wanted to give them a complete education in order to make them scientists like themselves
so they told these young people who were almost adults that they could pursue their scientific studies and in so doing they would become as knowledgeable as their creators
and the eyes of them both were opened and they knew that they were naked
genesis
t he t g the new human beings then understood that they could also become creators in their turn and they became angry at their parents for having kept them away from scientific books considering them to be like dangerous laboratory animals
and said unto the serpent because thou hast done this thou art cursed  upon thy belly thou go and dust thou eat all the days of thy life
genesis
the serpent was this small group of creators who had wished to tell the truth to and eve and as a result they were condemned by the government of their own planet to live in exile on earth while all the other scientists had to put a stop to their experiments and leave unto also and to his wife did make coats of skins and clothed them
genesis
the creators gave their creations the basic means of survival enough to manage without needing any further contact with them
the has preserved a sentence which is close to the original behold the man is become as one of us to know good and evil and now lest he put forth his hand and take also of the tree of life and eat and live for ever
genesis
human life is very short but there is a scientific way to prolong it
human scientists who study all their lives can only begin to amass sufficient knowledge to start making interesting discoveries when they get old which is the reason why human progress is so slow
if humans could live ten times longer scientific knowledge would take a gigantic leap forward
i f t he if when they were first created these new beings could have lived much longer they would have quite rapidly become our equals because their mental faculties are slightly superior to our own
they are unaware of their full potential
this applies especially to the people of who as i mentioned earlier had been selected in a contest as the most successful type of on earth due to their intelligence and genius
this explains why they have always considered themselves to be the chosen people
in truth they were the people chosen by the teams of scientists who gathered together to judge their creations
you can see for yourself the number of geniuses born out of that race
so he drove out the man and he placed at the east of the garden of and a flaming sword which turned every way to keep the way of the tree of life
genesis
soldiers with atomic disintegration weapons were placed at the entrance to the creators residence to prevent human beings from stealing more scientific knowledge
let us move on to the fourth chapter of genesis
and in process of time it came to pass that brought of the fruit of the ground an offering unto
and he also brought of the of his flock and of the fat thereof
genesis
the creators in exile who were left under military surveillance urged the human beings to bring them food in order to show their own superiors that the newly created people were good and that they t he t t he f would never turn against their creators
thus they managed to obtain permission for the leaders of these first human beings to benefit from the tree of life and this explains how they lived so long lived for years for years and for years and so on as is stated in genesis chapter verses
and it came to pass when men began to multiply on the face of the earth and daughters were born unto them that the sons of saw the daughters of men that they were fair and they took them wives of all which they chose
genesis
the creators living in exile took the most beautiful daughters of humanity and made them their wives
my spirit shall not always strive with man for that he also is flesh yet his days shall be an hundred and twenty years
genesis
longevity is not hereditary and much to the relief of the authorities on the distant planet the children of the new human beings did not automatically benefit from the tree of life
thus the secret of life was lost and progress was slowed down
when the sons of came in unto the daughters of men and they bare children to them the same became mighty men which were of old men of renown
genesis
there you have proof that the creators could have intercourse with the daughters of humanity whom they had created in their own image and in so doing produced exceptional children
these actions seemed very dangerous to people on the distant planet
the scientific progress on earth was fantastic and they decided to destroy what had been created
i f t he and saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually
genesis
the evil in question was the desire of human beings to become scientific and independent people equal to their creators
being good as far as those on the planet were concerned meant the new human beings would remain primitive on the earth
their evil was their wish to progress perhaps enabling them one day to catch up with their creators
the government then decided from their distant planet to destroy all life on earth by sending nuclear missiles
however when the exiled creators were informed of the project they asked to build a spaceship which would orbit the earth during the containing a pair of each species that was to be preserved
this was true speaking but in reality and your scientific knowledge will very soon enable you to understand this a single living cell of each species male and female is all that is required to recreate a whole being
this is something like the first living cell of a in the womb of its mother which already possesses all the information needed to create a human being right down to the color of its eyes and hair
this was a colossal task but it was completed on time
when the explosion took place life had already been preserved a few thousand kilometers above the earth
the continent was submerged by a gigantic tidal wave which destroyed all forms of life on its surface
the  was lift up above the earth
genesis
as you can clearly see it is said that the was lifted above the earth and not on the water
then it was necessary to wait until there was no more dangerous radioactive fallout t he t t he f and the waters prevailed upon the earth an hundred and fifty days
genesis
the spacecraft had three sections  and the door of the thou set in the side thereof with lower second and third stories thou make it
genesis
later it landed on earth and besides it carried a couple from each race of human beings on the earth
and remembered  and made a wind to pass over the earth and the waters
genesis
after monitoring the level of radioactivity and dispersing it scientifically the creators told to release the animals to see if they could survive in the atmosphere
this operation was successful and they were able to venture out into the open air
the creators then asked the human survivors to work and multiply and show their gratitude to their who had created them and saved them from destruction
agreed to give a portion of their harvest and their cattle to the creators to ensure they survived and an altar unto and took of every clean beast and of every clean fowl and offered burnt offerings on the altar
genesis
the creators were happy to see that humans wished them well and they promised never to try to destroy their creation again
they understood that it was only normal for them to want to progress scientifically
 for the imagination of mans heart is evil
genesis
i f t he the goal of is scientific progress
each race of humanity was then returned to its original place of creation and each animal was recreated from the cells which had been preserved aboard and by these were the nations divided in the earth after the flood
genesis
the tower of babel but the most intelligent race the people of was making such remarkable progress that they were soon able to undertake the conquest of space with the help of the exiled creators
the latter wanted their new human beings to go to the creators planet to obtain their pardon by showing that they were not only intelligent and scientific but also grateful and peaceful
so they built an enormous rocket the tower of babel
and now nothing will be restrained from them which they have imagined to do
genesis
the people on our planet became frightened when they heard about this
they were still observing the earth and knew that life had not been destroyed
go to let us go down and there their language that they may not understand one speech
so scattered them abroad from thence upon the face of all the earth
genesis
t he t t he tower o f b so they came and took the who had the most scientific knowledge and scattered them all over the continent among primitive tribes in countries where nobody could understand them because the language was different and they destroyed all their scientific instruments
and the exiled creators were pardoned and allowed to return to their original planet where they pleaded the case of their magnificent creation
as a result everyone on the distant planet fixed their eyes on the earth because it was inhabited by people they had themselves but among the humans who had been dispersed on earth a few the desire for vengeance so they gathered in the towns of and and having managed to salvage a few scientific secrets they prepared an expedition aimed at punishing those who had tried to destroy them
consequently the creators sent two spies to investigate what was going on and there came two angels to at even
genesis
some humans tried to kill them but the spies managed to blind their attackers with a pocket atomic weapon and they the men that were at the door of the house with blindness both small and great
genesis
they warned those who were peaceful to leave the town because they were going to destroy it with an atomic explosion intelligent design message from the designers up get you out of this place for will destroy this city
genesis
as the people were leaving town they were in no particular hurry because they did not realize what an atomic explosion could mean
escape for thy life look not behind thee neither stay thou in all the plain
genesis
and the bomb fell on and then rained upon and upon and fire from out of heaven and he those cities and all the plain and all the inhabitants of the cities and that which grew upon the ground
but his wife looked back from behind him and she became a pillar of salt
genesis
as you now know burns caused by an atomic explosion kill those who are too near and make them look like salt statues
the sacrifice of later after most of their leading intellectuals had been destroyed and they had into a state the creators wished to see if the people of and particularly their leader still had positive feelings towards them
this is related in the paragraph where wants to sacrifice his own son
the creators tested him to see if his feelings towards them were sufficiently strong
fortunately the experiment ended positively
t he t t he o f a lay not thine hand upon the lad neither do thou any thing unto him for now i know that thou
genesis
there you have it
assimilate it all and write down everything that i have just told you
i will tell you more tomorrow
once again the small man took leave of me and his spacecraft rose slowly into the air
because the sky was clearer this time i was able to watch more closely as it took off
it hovered motionless at a height of about meters then still without the slightest sound the vessel turned red as if it was heating up then as white as metal and then finally a sort of bluish purple like an enormous spark which was impossible to look at
then it disappeared completely
watching over the chosen people he following day i again met with my visitor and he immediately continued his story
in genesis chapter there is another description of our and behold a ladder set up on the earth and the top of it reached to heaven and behold the angels of ascending and descending on it
genesis
because of the destruction of centers of progress such as and and the elimination of the most intelligent individuals human beings had lapsed back into a very primitive state and had begun rather stupidly to adore pieces of stone and idols forgetting those who had really created them put away the foreign gods that are among you
genesis
in exodus we appeared to
and the angel of appeared unto him in a flame of fire out of the midst of a bush and he looked and behold the bush watching over p burned with fire and the bush was not consumed
exodus
a rocket landed in front of him and his description corresponds to what a might say today if we were to land before him in a flying vessel illuminating the trees without burning the people chosen as the most intelligent had lost their most brilliant minds and had become slaves to neighboring tribes who were more numerous since they had not undergone the same destruction
it was thus necessary to restore dignity to the people of by returning their land to them
the beginning of exodus describes all that we had to do to help liberate the people of
once departed we guided them to the country which we had destined for them and went before them by day in a pillar of a cloud to lead them the way and by night in a pillar of fire to give them light to go by day and night
exodus
in order to slow down the march of the who had started to pursue them the pillar of the cloud went from before their face and stood behind them  and it was a cloud and darkness to them but it gave light by night to these so that the one came not near the other all the night
exodus
the smoke emitted behind the people of made a curtain which slowed down their pursuers
then the crossing of the water was made possible by a repulsion beam which cleared a passageway i f t he and caused the sea to go back by a strong east wind all that night and made the sea dry land and the waters were divided
exodus
thus saved that day out of the hand of the
exodus
while they were crossing the desert the chosen people began to feel upon the face of the wilderness there lay a small round thing as small as the frost on the ground
exodus
the was nothing more than pulverized synthetic chemical food which when spread on the ground swelled with the early morning dew
as for the staff which allowed to draw water from the rock as it says in exodus it was nothing but a detector of underground water pools similar to those which you use at present to find oil for example
once the water is located one has only to dig
then in chapter of exodus a certain number of rules are cited
because the were so primitive they needed laws regarding morals and especially hygiene
these were outlined in the
the creators came to dictate these laws to on mount and they arrived in a flying vessel and it came to pass on the third day in the morning that there were and and a thick cloud upon the mount and the voice of the trumpet exceeding loud so that all the people that was in the camp trembled  and mount was altogether on a smoke because descended upon it in fire and the smoke thereof ascended as the smoke of a furnace and the whole mount greatly
and when the voice of the trumpet watching over p sounded long and waxed louder and louder
and answered him by a voice
exodus
the creators were afraid of being invaded or by human beings
it was therefore essential that they be respected even venerated so that they would be in no danger the people can not come up to mount  but let not the priests and the people break through to come up unto lest he break forth upon them
exodus
also it was written and alone shall come near but they shall not come nigh neither shall the people go up with him
exodus
they saw the god of and there was under his feet as it were a paved work of a stone and as it were the body of heaven in his clearness
exodus
there you have the description of the pedestal upon which one of the creators presented himself and it was made of the same bluish alloys as the floor of the machine in which we are now sitting
and the sight of the glory of was like fire on the top of the mount
exodus
here you have a description of the glory of the creators in reality the flying vessel and as you have already noticed upon takeoff it has a coloration similar to that of fire
i f t he this team of creators was going to live on the earth for some time and they wished to eat fresh food
that is why they asked the to bring them fresh provisions regularly and also riches which they wanted to take back to their own planet
i suppose you might call it speak unto the children of that they bring me an offering of every man that giveth it willingly with his heart ye shall take my offering
and this is the offering which ye shall take of them gold and silver and brass and blue and purple and scarlet and fine linen and hair
exodus
they also decided that they would like to live more comfortably so they asked the human beings to build them a residence according to plans they had drawn up
the plans are described in chapter of the book of exodus
in this residence they would meet the representatives of the people
it was a meeting tent where people brought food and gifts as a pledge of submission
and it came to pass as entered into the the cloudy pillar descended and stood at the door of the and talked with  and unto face to face as a man unto his friend
exodus
just as today i can speak to you as you can speak to me man to thou not see my face for there shall no man see me and live
exodus
there you have reference to the difference in atmosphere between our planets
humans can not see their creators unless the latter are protected by a suit because the terrestrial atmosphere is watching over p not suitable for them
if a man came to our planet he would see the creators without a space suit but he would die because the atmosphere is not suitable for him
the entire beginning of explains how the foods offered to the creators had to be brought to them for their replenishment
for example in it says whosoever he be of thy seed in their generations that hath any blemish let him not approach to offer the bread of his
this is obviously to prevent sick or people who were symbols of failure and therefore unbearable to the eyes of the creators from presenting themselves before them
in the book of numbers there is a very precise description of the which your chemists could very easily reproduce and the was as coriander seed and the thereof as the of  and the taste of it was as the taste of fresh this was nothing more than a chemical food but the creators preferred fresh fruits and vegetables and whatsoever is first ripe in the land which they shall bring unto shall be thine
numbers
later the creators taught human beings how to inject themselves to treat make thee a fiery serpent and set it upon a pole and it shall come to pass that every one that is bitten when he upon it shall live
numbers
i f t he as soon as someone was bitten he looked at the serpent of brass that is to say a syringe was brought to him and he was injected with serum
finally the journey which led the chosen people to the promised land came to an end
following the advice of the creators they destroyed the idols of the local primitive people and took over their territories then ye shall  destroy all their molten images  and ye shall the inhabitants of the land and dwell therein for i have given you the land to possess it
numbers
the chosen people finally reached their promised land and because he loved thy fathers therefore he chose their seed after them
 in the book of chapter verses we read about the crossing of the and as they that bare the were come unto  the waters which came down from above stood and rose up upon an heap very far from the city  and those that came down toward the sea of the plain even the salt sea failed and were cut off and the people passed over right against
thus the creators helped the chosen people cross without getting their feet wet just as they had done in their escape from the by using the same water repulsion ray
watching over p t he t the of at the end of chapter in the book of there is a meeting between a military creator and the chosen people regarding the resistance of the city of
but as captain of the host of am i now come
 a military consultant was sent to the people to assist them in the siege of
it is easy to understand how the walls were knocked down
you know that the very high voice of a singer can crack a crystal glass
by using highly amplified ultrasonic waves one can knock down any concrete wall
this is what was done using a very complicated instrument which the calls a trumpet when they make a long blast with the horn and when ye hear the sound of the trumpet  and the wall of the city shall fall down flat
 at a given moment the were emitted in a synchronized way and the walls fell down
a little later some real bombing took place cast down great stones from heaven upon them unto and they died they were more which died with than they whom the children of with the sword
 this full scale bombing as indicated killed more people than the swords of the
one of the most distorted passages is in chapter verse where it is stated i f t he and the sun stood still and the moon stayed until the people had themselves upon their enemies
this simply means that it was a flash war which lasted only one day in fact it is stated later that the war occupied about a whole day
it was so short when you consider the extent of the land conquered that people thought the sun had stood still
in the book of judges chapter verse one of the creators is again in contact with a man called who delivers food to him then the angel of put forth the end of the staff that was in his hand and touched the flesh and the unleavened cakes and there rose up fire out of the rock and consumed the flesh and the unleavened cakes
then the angel of departed out of his the creators were unable to eat in the open air because of their suits but if necessary using a scientific technique they could feed themselves by extracting the essentials from these offerings using a flexible tube or cane
the process radiates flames which made people at the time think sacrifices to god were being made
in chapter of the book of judges men with surrounded the enemy camp and using highly amplified ultrasonic instruments they blew them simultaneously in order to drive all the people in the camp mad
you know now that certain high pitched sounds carried to extremes can drive anyone mad
indeed the people who had been surrounded went mad the soldiers killed each other and ran away
watching over p t the in judges chapter there is yet another example of mating taking place between the creators and human women and the angel of appeared unto the woman and said unto her behold now thou art barren and not but thou conceive and bear a son
judges
it was necessary that the fruit of this union be healthy so that the behavior of the child could be studied
this is why he tells her and drink not wine nor strong drink and eat not any unclean thing for lo thou conceive and bear a son and no razor shall come on his head for the child shall be a unto from the womb
judges
later it is written and the angel of came again unto the woman as she sat in the field but her husband was not with her
judges
it is easy to imagine what happened during her husbands absence  it was an easy task for the scientists to cure her sterility
in this way she was made aware that she was going to give birth to an exceptional individual and that she should take the utmost care of her baby
it was wonderful for the creators to mate with a daughter of humanity
this enabled them to have sons ruling directly on earth where the atmosphere was not suitable for themselves
the point about not shaving off any hair is very important
the human brain is like a huge transmitter capable of sending out a i f t he multitude of very accurate waves and thoughts
in fact telepathy is nothing more than that
but this type of transmitter requires antennae and the hair and beard are these antennae
that is why you should not shave off any hair if you want to make use of your
you have surely noticed that many of your scientists have long hair and often a beard
prophets and other wise people have them too
now you can understand why
the child was born
it was whose story you know
he was able to communicate directly with god by telepathy thanks to his natural antennae his hair
and the creators could then help him during difficult moments and produce marvels to reinforce his but when cut his hair he could no longer ask for help
then his eyes were gouged out by his enemies but when his hair grew again he regained his strength
that is to say he could once again ask for help from the creators who then demolished the temple where he was touching the columns
all of this was attributed to strength
in chapter we find initiating into telepathy
the creators wanted to contact and he thinks that is speaking to him
he hears voices go lie down and it shall be if he call thee that thou say speak for thy servant
 this is a little like the behavior of amateur radio operators who might say go ahead i can hear you loud and clear
and the conversation begins
then answered speak for thy servant
 watching over p t he t in the episode where challenges there is quite an interesting sentence which ends  that he should defy the armies of the living
this shows the reality of the presence in that epoch of a quite tangible god
telepathy as a means of communication between the creators and human beings was only possible when the were in proximity to the earth
when they were on their distant planet or elsewhere they could not communicate in this way
for this reason they set up a which was transported in the of god an apparatus containing its own atomic powered cell
this is why in the first book of chapters and when the stole the their idol lay face down on the ground nearby as the result of an electrical discharge caused by their clumsy of it
they also suffered radiation burns from the dangerous radioactive and them with
 even the who had not taken precautions while handling the were harmed put forth his hand to the of and took hold of it for the oxen shook it
and the anger of was kindled against and him there for his error and there he died by the of
 the almost fell over and trying to hold it up touched a dangerous part of the machine and was
i f t he in the first book of kings kings and kings we read in several places of individuals who caught hold on the horns of the this refers to the manipulation of the levers while trying to communicate with the creators
the first residence to welcome the the great king had a sumptuous residence built in order to welcome the creators when they came to visit the earth said he would dwell in thick darkness
i have surely built thee an house to dwell in
kings
for the glory of had filled the house of
kings
the cloud filled the house of
kings
and i will dwell among the children of
kings
so the creators lived in a cloud or rather in a vessel that orbits above the clouds
imagine trying to make primitive people understand that
there came a man of out of by the word of unto  and said  behold the altar shall be rent
when king heard the saying of the man of which had cried against the altar in that he put forth his hand from the altar saying lay hold on him
and his hand which he put forth against him dried up so that he could not pull it in again to him
kings
watching over p t he f r to w t he e with the help of an atomic one of the creators destroyed the altar and burned the hand of the man who did not show respect for the creators
he returns to one of the terrestrial camps by another route to keep their whereabouts secret so he went another way and returned not by the way that he came to
kings
in kings chapter verse there is an example of the radio control of animals through the use of as you yourselves are beginning to discover and the brought him bread and flesh in the morning and bread and flesh in the evening
because of recent discoveries the creators decided to appear as little as possible in order not to influence the destiny of man too much so that they could see if they would reach the age of scientific knowledge on their own
so the creators began to use increasingly discreet means of communicating with humans as in the method of feeding using homing
this was the beginning of a gigantic experiment throughout the galaxy in which several humanities are in competition
the creators decided to appear less often while at the same time reinforcing the authority and reputation of their ambassadors the prophets by using miracles
that is to say scientific means which were then incomprehensible to the people of that era see your son lives  now by this i know that you are a man of god
kings
had healed a young child who was dying
later he ordered two bull calves to be placed on logs at mount one to be i f t he to the idol and the other to the creators
the one that would ignite by itself would represent the one true god
obviously at a moment agreed upon in advance between and the creators the chosen log burst into flames even though the wood was wet
this was accomplished by a powerful beam similar to a emitted from a vessel hidden in the clouds then the fire of fell and consumed the burnt sacrifice and the wood and the stones and the dust and licked up the water that was in the trench
kings
the messenger the creators paid particular attention to
then an angel touched him and said unto him arise and eat
and he looked and behold there was a cake on the coals and a of water at his head
kings
all this happened in the desert  and behold passed by and a great and strong wind rent the mountains and brake in pieces the rocks before but was not in the wind and after the wind an earthquake but was not in the earthquake and after the earthquake a fire but was not in the fire and after the fire a still small voice
kings
watching over p e t he there you have the exact description of a landing by a machine similar to one of your rockets
then further on a vision of the creators is described i saw sitting on his throne and all the host of heaven standing by him
kings
the creators once again used telepathy this time group telepathy so that none of the prophets could predict the truth to the king i will be a lying spirit in the mouth of all his prophets
kings
in the second book of kings there is further evidence of the protection which the creators gave to if i be a man of let fire come down from heaven and consume thee and thy fifty
and the fire of came down from heaven and consumed him and his fifty
kings
this operation happened again but the third time and the angel of said unto go down with him
kings
in the second book of kings chapter is invited onto a spacecraft which takes off with him on board when would take up into heaven by a whirlwind
kings
there appeared a chariot of fire and horses of fire and parted i f t he them both asunder and went up by a whirlwind into heaven
kings
this is a spacecraft taking off and when the narrator speaks of horses of fire he is referring to the fire which was emitted from the blast pipes
if you showed certain south or tribes people a rocket taking off they would be incapable of understanding this scientific phenomenon in a rational way and would look upon it as something supernatural mystical and divine
when returning to their tribes they would speak of of fire and horses of fire
further on in the second book of kings chapter verses like his father performs a resurrection
he and brings back to life a child who was dead
this happens quite frequently nowadays when mouth to mouth and heart massage revive a person whose cardiac muscle has ceased to function
then proceeds to multiply the bread
the multiplication of bread a man  brought the man of bread of the twenty loaves of barley  and his said what should i set this before an hundred men  he said again give the people that they may eat for thus saith they shall eat and shall leave thereof
so he set it before them and they did eat and left thereof according to the word of
kings
the creators had brought synthetic dehydrated food with them which when added to water increased to five times its original volume
so with twenty small loaves of bread there was enough food for a hundred people
watching over p t he you are already familiar with the little vitamin pills which nourished your first
they take up very little space but contain all the necessary nutritional elements
one pill is enough to feed one person
a quantity equivalent in volume to one small loaf of bread is enough to feed five people
therefore twenty loaves are sufficient to feed one hundred people
but the people of had begun metal idols they had also become cannibals and were completely immoral much to the disgust of their creators so was carried away out of their own land
kings
that was the beginning of the dispersion of the whose civilization instead of making progress was constantly in contrast to their neighbors who took advantage of the situation
in the book of you again find in the year that king died i saw also sitting upon a throne high and lifted up  above it stood the each one had six wings with he covered his face and with he covered his feet and with he did fly
 that is a description of the creators dressed in their one piece space suits fitted with six small jet engines two on their backs two on their hands and two at their feet these ones for steering purposes
the noise of a multitude in the mountains like as of a great people a tumultuous noise of the kingdoms of nations gathered together of hosts the host of the battle
they come from a far country from the end of heaven even and the weapons of his indignation to destroy the whole land
 i f t he the whole truth is in that quote it is just a matter of reading between the lines in order to understand
they come from a far country from the end of heaven
that could not be clearer
for thou hast said in thine heart i will ascend into heaven i will exalt my throne above the stars of
 this refers to the human scientists who had accumulated sufficient knowledge to undertake a trip to the creators planet but were destroyed at and
the army of the heavens is described here at that time when they arrived with the weapons of wrath to destroy the whole country
it was those human scientists of and who said i will ascend above the heights of the clouds i will be like the most high
 but the destruction prevented humans from their creators the most high that made the world as a wilderness
 the nuclear explosion is described further on for the cry is gone round about the borders of the howling thereof unto and the howling thereof unto
for the waters of shall be full of blood 
a few were saved because they sheltered in come my people enter thou into thy chambers and shut thy doors about thee hide as it were for a little moment until the indignation be
 watching over p t he f lying the flying saucers of it is in the book of that we find the most interesting description of one of our flying machines i looked and behold a stormy wind came out of the north a great cloud with flashing lightning and a brightness round about it and out of the midst of it as it were glowing metal out of the midst of the fire
out of the midst of it came the likeness of four living creatures
this was their appearance they had the likeness of a man
everyone had four faces and everyone of them had four wings
their feet were straight feet and the sole of their feet was like the sole of a foot and they sparkled like burnished brass
they had the hands of a man under their wings on their four sides and they four had their faces and their wings thus their wings were joined one to another they turn when they went they went everyone straight forward
as for the likeness of their faces they had the face of a man and they four had the face of a lion on the right side and they four had the face of an ox on the left side they four had also the face of an eagle
their faces and their wings were separate above two wings of everyone were joined one to another and two covered their bodies
they went everyone straight forward where the spirit was to go they went they turn when they went
as for the likeness of the living creatures their appearance was like burning coals of fire like the appearance of torches the fire went up and down among the living creatures and the fire was bright and out of the fire went forth lightning
the living creatures ran and returned as the appearance of a flash of now as i saw the living creatures behold one wheel on the beside the living creatures for each of the four faces of it
i f t he the appearance of the wheels and their work was like a and they four had one likeness and their appearance and their work was as it were a wheel within a wheel
when they went they went in their four directions they turn when they went
as for their rims they were high and dreadful and they four had their rims full of eyes round about
when the living creatures went the wheels went beside them and when the living creatures were lifted up from the the wheels were lifted up
wherever the spirit was to go they went there was the spirit to go and the wheels were lifted up beside them for the spirit of the living creature was in the wheels
when those went these went and when those stood these stood and when those were lifted up from the the wheels were lifted up beside them for the spirit of the living creature was in the wheels
over the head of the living creature there was the likeness of an expanse like the awesome crystal to look on stretched forth over their heads above
under the expanse were their wings straight the one toward the other everyone had two which covered on this side and every one had two which covered on that side their bodies
when they went i heard the noise of their wings like the noise of great waters like the voice of a noise of like the noise of a host when they stood they let down their wings
there was a voice above the expanse that was over their heads when they stood they let down their wings
above the expanse that was over their heads was the likeness of a throne as the appearance of a stone and on the likeness of the throne was a likeness as the appearance of a man on it above
 there you have a description which could not be more precise of the creators who had come out of their flying machines
the stormy wind is the trace of smoke or vapor trail that planes leave behind them at high
then the machine appeared with its blinking light the flashing lightning and glowing metal
later watching over p t he f lying four creators appear wearing suits with small directional jet engines attached
these are described as the wings on their metal suits and their feet  sparkled like burnished brass
you have surely noticed how shiny the suits of your are
as for the flying saucers or wheels their appearance and their operation were not at all badly described considering it is a primitive person who is speaking
as it were a wheel within a wheel  they turn when they went
in the center of the flying very similar to the one in which we are now sitting was the habitable section the rim
they four had their rims full of eyes round about
in the same way that our clothing has evolved and we no longer wear those cumbersome space suits our vessels then had the eyes around the rims because we had not then discovered how to see through metallic walls by modifying their atomic structure at will
the flying saucers stayed near the creators ready to help them if the need arose since they were loading supplies and carrying out routine maintenance on the large vessel above them
other creators inside the vessels were directing them
 for the spirit of the living creature was in the wheels
this is quite clear
the suit described with its four was similar to your first diving suits
everyone had four faces  they turn when they the smaller saucers were something like your own lunar excursion modules small short range vehicles used for exploratory missions
above them the larger interplanetary vessel waited
above the expanse that was over their heads was the likeness of a throne as the appearance of a stone and on the likeness of the throne was a likeness as the appearance of a man on it above
 the latter individual on the large vessel was supervising and coordinating the work of the creators
i f t he frightened by all this fell flat on his face before these things which were so mysterious that they had to have come from no one other than god
but one of the creators said to him son of man stand on your feet and i will speak with you  hear what i tell you  and eat that which i give you
and
this is an image like the eating from the tree of science of good and evil
it was intellectual food that he was given
in this case it was there was a hand stretched out to me and behold a of a book was in it  there was writing on the inside and on the outside
 there was writing on both sides a very surprising thing at that time when usually only one side of parchment was written on
then the is eaten
this means that absorbed its meaning
what he learned is what you are learning now about origins
it was so exciting and comforting that he said then did i eat it and it was in my mouth as honey for sweetness
 then is transported in the creators vessel to the place where he was to spread the news then the spirit took me up and i heard behind me a voice of a great rushing
 further on the prophet is transported once again in a flying watching over p t he f lying  and the spirit lifted me up between the earth and the heaven and brought me in the visions of to
 noticed afterwards that beneath their wings the had hands like humans and there appeared in the the form of a mans hand under their wings
 and the lifted up their wings and mounted up from the earth in my sight when they went out the wheels also were beside them 
moreover the spirit lifted me up and brought me 
and the glory of went up from the midst of the city and stood upon the mountain which is on the east side of the city
afterwards the spirit took me up and brought me in a vision by the spirit of into 
there you have some of the many journeys of in one of the creators flying machines
the hand of was upon me and carried me out in the spirit of and set me down in the midst of the valley which was full of bones
 here a miracle is about to happen
the creators go on to human beings whose only remains are their bones
as mentioned earlier each particle of a living being contains all the information to reconstruct it completely
all you have to do is place one of these particles for example from bone remains in a machine i f t he which provides all the living matter required to reconstruct that original being
the machine supplies the matter and the particle supplies all the required information the blueprint according to which the being will be built just as a contains all the information necessary to create a living being in the first place right down to the color of the hair and eyes
son of man can these bones live  there was a noise and behold a shaking  the sinews and the flesh came up upon them and the skin covered them above  and they lived and stood up upon their feet an exceeding great army
 all this is very easy to do and you will do it some day
this is the origin of the ancient rituals in which elaborately protective were built to bury great people so that one day they may be brought back to life everlasting
this is part of the secret of the tree of life the secret of eternity
in chapter is again carried away in a spacecraft which takes him into the presence of someone wearing a space suit brought he me into the land of and set me upon a very high mountain by which was as the frame of a city on the south
and he brought me thither and behold there was a man whose appearance was like the appearance of brass 
this city is one of the earth bases that the creators used at that time
they were always located on very high mountains so that the creators would not be disturbed by humans
the man whose appearance was the appearance of brass is of course wearing a metallic suit
similarly due to our small stature we were often mistaken for children or
the priests in serving the creators in their terrestrial residence the temple visited by wore aseptic clothing when performing watching over p t he f lying their duties and those clothes always had to remain in the temple to avoid being contaminated by germs dangerous to the creators when the priests enter therein then shall they not go out of the holy place into the utter court but there they shall lay their garments wherein they minister for they are holy
they should have written for these garments are pure or sterile but that was incomprehensible for primitive people who all that was told or shown to them at that period
in chapter the big vessel respectfully called the glory of god approached
the glory of the god of came from the way of the east
his voice was like the sound of many waters and the earth shone with his glory
 the creators did not want to be disturbed so they issued a this gate shall be shut it shall not be opened and no man shall enter in by it because the of hath entered in by it therefore it shall be shut
 only a prince is allowed to come and speak with the creators it is for the prince the prince he shall sit in it to eat bread before
 but the prince had to pass through a chamber where he was by special rays i f t he he shall enter by the way of the porch of that gate and shall go out by the way of the same
 the priests were there to look after the creators they shall come near to me to minister unto me and they shall stand before me to offer unto me the fat and the blood  and they shall come near to my table to minister unto me 
the odor of human perspiration was very unpleasant to the when they enter in at the gates of the inner court they shall be clothed with linen garments  they shall not gird themselves with any thing that sweat
 there is a description also of how the supply of fresh products continued the first of all the  ye shall also give unto the priest the first of your dough that he may cause the blessing to rest in thine house
 in chapter of the book of king condemned three men to the stake for refusing to worship a metal god instead of the creators whom he knew existed
but the three men were saved by one of the creators who came to their aid in the glowing fire armed with a repellent and ray
he protected them from the heat and the flames with this and allowed them to walk away totally unscathed watching over p t he f lying lo i see four men loose walking in the midst of the fire and they have no hurt and the form of the fourth is like the son of
 further on is cast into the lions den but the lions do not harm him
there again nothing too complicated was involved just a beam to give enough time to get out of the den my hath sent his angel and hath shut the lions mouths
 in the tenth chapter of you will find another interesting description of a creator then i lifted up mine eyes and looked and behold a certain man  his body also was like the and his face as the appearance of lightning and his eyes as lamps of fire and his arms and his feet like in to polished brass and the voice of his words like the voice of a multitude
 the last judgement if the people were dominated by the and the it was because of their lack of faith
consequently the punished the by sending some of their angels amongst the and to help those nations to progress technologically
this explains the great moments in the history of those two civilizations
the was the leader of the delegation which was helping the i f t he one of the chief princes came to help me and i remained there with the kings of
 in chapter of the resurrection is again mentioned and many of them that sleep in the dust of the earth shall awake some to everlasting life and some to shame and everlasting contempt
 the last judgement will enable great individuals to live again
those people who have acted positively for humanity and who have truly believed in their creators and followed their will be welcomed with great joy by the people of the era when this will happen
on the other hand all the wicked people will feel shame before their judges and will live in eternal regret as an example for the rest of humanity and they that be wise shall shine as the brightness of the and they that turn many to righteousness as the stars for ever and ever
 the geniuses will be the most highly esteemed and the most highly rewarded
those just individuals who allowed the geniuses to blossom or the truth to triumph will also be rewarded
shut up the words and seal the book even to the time of the end many shall run to and and knowledge shall be increased
 these words will only be understood when humanity has reached a sufficient level of scientific understanding that is to say now
all this will happen watching over p t he l and when he shall have accomplished to scatter the power of the holy people all these things shall be finished
 this will be when the people of recover their land after their long
the state of was created a few decades ago at the same time as the explosion of scientific go thy way for the words are closed up and sealed till the time of the end
 all this will only be understood in this epoch
in recent years scientific progress and the beginning of space exploration by human beings have been such that everything seems possible for humanity
nothing surprises people anymore for they are used to seeing many wonders happening before their eyes on television
they can learn without astonishment that they really are made in the image of god their creator and even as far as their scientific abilities are concerned
these days miracles have become
in the big fish that swallows the prophet is very interesting indeed
after was thrown into the water from a small boat now had prepared a great fish to swallow up
and was in the belly of the fish three days and three nights
 the great fish was in reality a submarine as you know such vessels now
but for the people of that time it could only be a great fish even though the juices of such a fish would have digested a man quickly without any hope of his returning to the open air
what is more would have needed air to breathe
in the submarine the creators were able to carry on a conversation with to learn about the political developments of those times
i f t he and unto the fish and it out upon the dry land
 the submarine came close to the shore and was back on land
in chapter there is another description of a flying then i turned and lifted up mine eyes and looked and behold a flying roll  the length thereof is twenty meters and the breadth thereof ten
meters
 a little further on women amongst the creators appear for the first behold there came out two women and the wind was in their wings for they had wings like the wings of a 
these two female companions were accompanying the creators and both were equipped with flying suits when they appeared before
in verse it is said of human beings for thou hast made him a little lower than the angels
human beings are virtually as strong intellectually as their creators
those who copied out the texts did not dare write equal to the as it had been originally dictated
his going forth is from the end of the heaven and his circuit unto the ends of it
 watching over p t he l the creators came from a planet very far away from the in them hath he set a for the sun
 here is another allusion to the mass of earth which was created to form the original continent when the oceans covered the earth
from heaven he all the sons of men
from the place of his he upon all the inhabitants of the earth
 the creators watch behavior as they always have done from their flying vessels
in the book of job chapter you have the explanation of now there was a day when the sons of came to present themselves before and came also among them
in literally means those who came from the sky
the sons of in other words the creators who watch human beings report regularly to their planet of origin indicating for the most part that human beings and love the
but one of these called was part of a group which had always condemned the creation of other intelligent beings on a planet as close as the earth seeing them as a possible threat
that is why on i f t he seeing jobs devotion which was one of the best examples of human beings loving their creators he said job fear for  but put forth thine hand now and touch all that he hath and he will curse thee to thy face
and said unto behold all that he hath is in thy power only upon himself put not forth thine hand
job
hearing assertion that had job not been rich he would not have loved his creators the government gave full power to to ruin job
it would then be seen if he still venerated his creators and that is why killing him was forbidden
on seeing jobs dedication to respecting his creators even when he was ruined the government over the opposition
but retorted that though job had lost many things he was still in good health
so the government gave carte blanche so long as he did not kill job behold he is in thine hand but save his life
job
again in the book of job a small sentence in chapter is very interesting with him have you spread out the skies strong as a cast metal mirror job in other words are human beings capable of making a cast metal mirror in reality flying metallic vessels people of that time thought it was possible for no one but god
and yet today it can be done
finally in view of jobs humility the creators healed him and gave him back his wealth his children and his health
watching over p h ould n u humans could not understand in the book of in the one of the creators robots named also came to test reaction towards its once he had accomplished his mission he left after proving who all these days i did appear unto you but i did neither eat nor drink  for i go up to him that sent me but write all things which are done in a book
 all of this is easy to see in the writings
but once again you must try to understand
as for wisdom what she is and how she came up i will tell you and will not hide mysteries from you but will seek her out from the beginning of her and bring the knowledge of her into light and will not pass over the truth
wisdom of
when the time comes wisdom the science which allowed all this to happen will be known by man
the biblical writings will be proof of all this
for by the greatness and beauty of the creatures the maker of them is seen
wisdom of
so it is simple to see the truth recognizing the creators by observing their creations
and could not out of the good things that are seen know him that is
wisdom of
i f t he to avoid being disturbed by humans the creators built their bases on high mountains where we now find traces of great civilizations in the and for example as well as at the bottom of the sea
gradually the mountain stations were abandoned in favor of submarine bases less accessible to humans
the creators who had been banished at the outset had hidden themselves in the oceans
in that day with his sore and great and strong sword shall punish the piercing serpent even that crooked serpent and he shall the dragon that is in the sea
 at that time the government of their planet wanted to destroy those who had created the humans
it was not easy to see clearly among all those wonders so of course the creators were and made into something abstract because human beings were unable to understand scientific facts
and the book is delivered to him that is not learned saying read this i pray thee and he saith i am not learned
 for a long time humanity has held the truth in its hands but could not understand until it was sufficiently evolved scientifically to every man is in his knowledge 
science enabled the creators to create and will enable human beings to do the same
possessed me in the beginning of his way before his works of oldi was set up from everlasting from the beginning or ever the earth was  when he prepared the heavens i was there  watching over p h ould n u when he gave to the sea his decree that the waters should not pass his commandment  then i was by him as one brought up with him and i was daily his delight rejoicing always before him rejoicing in the habitable part of his earth and my delights were with the sons of men
proverbs
intelligence and science these are the two virtues that enabled the creators to create the the single continent and the living beings they placed upon it
and now this intelligence and this spirit leads the human brain to repeat the acts of their creators
since the beginning of time it has been so people create other people like themselves on other planets
the cycle continues
some die others take over
we are your creators and you will create other humanities that which hath been is now and that which is to be hath already been
 the animals were also created and will be recreated
just like human beings no more no less
the species that disappear will live again when you know how to recreate them so that a man hath no above a beast for all is vanity
 we the creators will only show ourselves officially if humanity is grateful to us for having created them
we fear that human beings might hold a grudge against us which we can not accept
we would like to begin making open contact with you and give you the benefit of our considerable advance in scientific knowledge so long as we could be sure that you would not turn against us and that you would love us as your parents
i f t he woe unto him that with his maker  shall the clay say to him that it what thou or thy work he hath no hands woe unto him that saith unto his father what thou
fear of not being loved by human beings has led your creators to allow you to progress scientifically by yourselves with almost no help
the you see engraved on this machine and on my suit represents the truth
it is also the of the people the star of which means that which is above is like that which is below and in its center is the swastika which means that everything is the top becoming the bottom and the bottom in turn becoming the top
the origins and destiny of the creators and human beings are similar and linked
have ye not known have ye not heard hath it not been told you from the beginning have ye not understood from the foundations of the earth
the traces of the creators bases on high mountains is mentioned in the book of he that  upon the high places of the earth
 the creators had seven bases in all those seven they are the eyes of which run to and through the whole earth
 this is the origin of the the meaning of which has been lost
in the beginning at the creators headquarters there was a switchboard with seven lighted switches enabling them to watching over p h ould n u stay in contact with the other bases and with the interplanetary vessel orbiting the earth
in there is an allusion to telepathy for there is not a word in my tongue but lo o thou it altogether
thou hast beset me behind and before and laid thine hand upon me
such knowledge is too wonderful for me it is high i can not attain unto it
at that time telepathy was unimaginable hence such knowledge is too wonderful for me
astronomy and interplanetary journeys were also unthinkable at the time he the number of the stars he them all by their names
great is our and of great power his understanding is infinite
 human beings were also unable to understand he forth his commandment upon earth his word very swiftly
 we now reach a decisive turning point in the creators work
they decided at that period to let humanity progress scientifically without ever intervening directly
they understood that they themselves had been created in the same way and that by creating similar beings to themselves they were allowing the cycle to continue
but first in order for the truth to be spread throughout the world they decided to send a who would be able to communicate worldwide what the people of were then the only ones to know
this was in preparation for the day when the original mystery would i f t he be explained in the light of scientific progress that is to say the revelation
so they announced him but thou though thou be little among the thousands of yet out of thee shall he come forth unto me that is to be ruler in whose goings forth have been from of old from everlasting  and he shall stand and feed in the strength of  for now shall he be great unto the ends of the earth
and this man shall be the peace
 shout o daughter of behold thy king cometh unto thee  lowly and riding upon an ass  and he shall speak peace unto the heathen and his dominion shall be from sea even to sea
 the role of the conception he next morning we met again at the same spot and my host said role was to spread the truth of the biblical scriptures throughout the world so that they could serve as proof for all of humanity when the age of science would finally explain everything
the creators therefore decided to arrange for a child to be born of a woman of the earth and one of their own people
the child in question would thereby inherit certain faculties which humans lack she was found with child of the holy ghost
 was the woman chosen and obviously her fiance found these tidings hard to accept but behold the angel of appeared unto him
 one of the creators appeared to explain that would bring forth a son of god
the prophets who were in contact with the creators came from very far away to see the divine child
one of the of the creators guided them i f t he we have seen his star in the east and are come to worship him  the star which they saw in the east went before them till it came and stood over where the young child was
and
the creators watched over the child the angel of to in a dream saying arise and take the young child and his mother and flee into and be thou there until i bring thee word for will seek the young child to destroy him
 the king was not too happy about the coming from the people on his territory which was announced to him by the prophets
but after king died the creators told that he could return to but when was dead behold an angel of in a dream to in saying arise and take the young child and his mother and go into the land of for they are dead which sought the young life
 the initiation when he came of age was led to the creators so that they could reveal to him his true identity introduce him to his father reveal his mission and make known to him various scientific techniques
the heavens were opened unto him and he saw the spirit of descending like a dove and lighting upon him and lo a t he role o f t he i voice from heaven saying this is my beloved son in whom i am well pleased
then was led up of the spirit into the wilderness to be tempted of the devil and
the devil the creator of whom we spoke previously was always convinced that nothing good could come of humanity on earth
he was the and he was supported by the governments opposition on our distant planet
so he tested to find out if his intelligence was positive and if he really loved and respected his creators
having discovered that they could place complete confidence in was allowed to go and accomplish his mission
in order to rally people to him performed miracles which in reality were the application of scientific teachings shown to him by the creators and they brought unto him all sick people  and he healed them
 blessed are the poor in spirit
 this sentence has been interpreted as the poor are blessed
but the original meaning was that if the poor have spirit then they will be happy which is totally different
then told his apostles that they must spread the truth throughout the world
in the prayer called the lords prayer or the our father the truth is stated literally thy kingdom come
thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven
 in heaven on the creators planet the scientists eventually became the ruling group and then created other intelligent beings
i f t he the same thing will happen on earth
the torch will be taken up this prayer which has been repeated time and time again without anyone understanding its profound meaning now takes on its full significance on earth as it is in heaven
amongst other things had been taught to speak convincingly through a type of group hypnosis and so it was when had ended these sayings that the people were astonished at his teaching for he taught them as one having authority and not as the
 he continued to heal the sick with the help of the creators who directed concentrated beams from a distance a came and worshiped him saying lord if you are willing you can make me cleanthen put out his hand and touched him saying i am willing be cleansed
immediately his leprosy was cleansed
 and he did the same for a man who was completely paralyzed
the operation was carried out from a distance using a concentrated ray something like a which burns only one spot through several arise take up thy bed  and he arose
 further on in st gospel announced his mission for i came not to call the righteous but sinners
 t he role o f t he i he did not come for the people of who knew of the existence of the creators but rather so that this knowledge would be spread throughout the rest of the world
later there were more miracles somewhat similar to the first ones all of which were medical
nowadays there are of hearts and other organs leprosy and other similar illnesses are cured and people are brought out of a with appropriate care
these would be considered miracles by technologically primitive people
at that time human beings were primitive and the creators were similar to people of your present civilized nations although a little more advanced scientifically
further on we find an allusion to the creators among whom is real father every one therefore who shall confess me before men him will i also confess before my father who is in heaven
 before my father who is in heaven this says it all
in fact god is not intangible or immaterial
he is in heaven
this is obviously incomprehensible to people who at the time believed that the stars were attached to a heavenly canopy just like pretty light bulbs all rotating around the center of the world the earth
now since the advent of space travel and an understanding of the immensity of the universe the old texts are brought to light in a completely different parallel humanities in st gospel chapter there is an important passage where explains in a parable how the creators left their planet to create life on other worlds i f t he behold a went forth to sow and when he some seeds fell by the way side and the came and devoured them up some fell upon stony places where they had not much earth and they sprung up because they had no of earth and when the sun was up they were scorched and because they had no root they withered away
and some fell among thorns and the thorns sprung up and choked them but other fell into good ground and brought forth fruit some an some some
who hath ears to hear let him hear
 all this is an allusion to the various attempts to create life on other planets and three of them failed
the first failed because of the birds which came and ate the seeds
in fact this was a failure caused by the proximity of the planet in question to the creators original planet
those who were against the creation of people similar to themselves saw a possible threat in the experiment and therefore went to destroy the creation
the second attempt was made on a planet too near a sun that was too hot therefore their creation was destroyed by noxious radiation
the third attempt was made among thorns on a planet which was far too humid where the plant life was so powerful that it destroyed the equilibrium and the animal world
this world consisting only of plants still exists
but the fourth attempt was finally successful on good ground
and it is important to note that there were in fact three successes in all
this means that on two other planets which are relatively near to you there are living beings similar to yourselves who were created by the same creators
who hath ears to hear let him hear those who are able understand
when the time comes those who seek to understand will do so
the others those who look without really seeing and hear without really listening or understanding such people will not understand the truth
on the other hand those who prove their t he role o f parallel h intelligence by their own efforts and thus show themselves to be worthy of their creators help they will be helped
for whosoever hath to him shall be given and he shall have more abundance but whosoever hath not from him shall be taken away even that he hath
the people who will not be able to prove their intelligence will not survive
humans have almost proved that they are worthy of being recognized by their creators as their equals
they lack only  a little love
love for each other and particularly for their creators
it is given unto you to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven
 the three planets on which life has been created have been set in competition against one another
the planet on which humanity makes the most scientific progress thereby proving its intelligence will receive the benefit of their creators inheritance on the day of the last judgement so long as they do not behave aggressively towards their creators
this will be the day when their knowledge will have reached a sufficiently high level
at present human beings on earth are not very far away from that day
human genius is which indeed is the least of all seeds but when it is grown it is the greatest among herbs and becometh a tree so that the birds of the air come and lodge in the branches thereof
 the birds of the air here refers to the creators who will come and lodge in the branches that is to say will come to give their knowledge to humanity when humanity shows itself worthy of it
i f t he the kingdom of heaven is like unto which a woman took and hid in three measures of meal till the whole was leavened
 this is another allusion to the three worlds in which the creators are waiting for science to bloom
i will utter things which have been kept secret from the foundation of the world
 here we have something fundamentally important
planets have a life span and one day they will no longer be habitable
by that time humanity must have reached a level of scientific knowledge sufficient either to undertake a move to another planet or if it can not adapt itself elsewhere to create a form of life capable of surviving on another world
if the environment can not be adapted to suit people then people must be created who are compatible with the new environment
before humanity becomes extinct you would for example have to create another race of people capable of living in a totally different atmosphere who would inherit your knowledge before you disappear
so that this inheritance would not be lost the creators put life on three worlds and only the best one will be entitled to the inheritance so shall it be at the end of the world the angels shall come forth and sever the wicked from among the just
 t he role o f scientific miracles the passage concerning the multiplication of bread has already been explained
it refers to concentrated food products in the form of large pills rather like those containing all the vital elements which your use
your holy bread hosts are reminiscent of these pills
with the equivalent of a few loaves of bread there is enough to feed thousands of people
when walked on the water the creators supported him using an beam which cancelled the effect of weight at a precise he came unto them walking upon the sea
 the beam in fact created a turbulence which is described as but when he saw the wind boisterous he was afraid  and when they were come into the ship the wind ceased
 the wind ceased as they boarded the boat because the beam was switched off when reached it
another totally scientific miracle
in reality there are no such things as miracles only differences in levels of civilization
if you had landed at the time of in a spacecraft or even a simple helicopter even though your level of scientific development may have been limited you would in the eyes of the people of that time have been performing miracles
just by producing artificial light coming from the sky driving a car watching television or even by killing a bird with a gun because they would have been incapable of understanding the mechanism behind such phenomena people of the time would have seen in them i f t he a divine or supernatural force
also do not forget that the same scientific gap which exists between you and the people at the time of also exists now between you and us
we can still do things which you would consider miracles
but for the most advanced individuals among you they would no longer really be miracles since for the last few decades you have taken the path of science and are trying to grasp the reason behind things instead of yourselves on your bellies and bringing our knowledge however remains such that if we decided to perform a few miracles even your most eminent scientists would be unable to understand how we did them
there are some particularly well developed minds who would be able to cope with such things but people in general would simply panic and we are still capable of astonishing people even though they are no longer so easily shocked
it is necessary for people to understand that there is no ethereal god but only people who created other people in their image
in chapter of st gospel the creators appear once with him and and john his brother and them up into a high mountain apart and he was before them and his face did shine as the sun and his garments became white as the light  and behold there appeared unto them and talking with him  behold a voice out of the cloud saying this is my beloved son  hear ye him
 this scene happens at night and the apostles are all frightened to see illuminated by the powerful searchlights of the spacecraft out of which and stepped still alive thanks to the tree of life from which they had benefited
immortality is a scientific reality even if it does not correspond to idea of immortality
t he role o f in chapter verse of st there is a sentence but many that are first shall be last and the last shall be first
this means that the created shall become creators just as the creators were created
deserving the inheritance in chapter verses of st gospel it is said that the three planets must make scientific progress and they will be judged one day
we read in the parable leaving for a trip a man entrusted three of his slaves with his goodsthe first one received five talents the second two talents the third one talent
when the master returns the first gave back to him the five talents and shows him five others which he won
the second gave him back the two talents plus two others that he won
the third gave him back only one talent the one that was given to him
take therefore the talent from him and give it unto him which hath ten talents
for unto every one that hath shall be given and he shall have abundance but from him that hath not shall be taken away even that which he hath
out of the three worlds where life has been created the one which makes the most progress will receive the inheritance
the ones which have not progressed will be dominated by the other and eliminated
this is also true on earth between peoples
in st gospel chapter reveals the importance of his death and of the writings which would later serve as proof
when one of his companions tried to defend him with a sword he said i f t he put up again thy sword into his place for all they that take the sword shall perish with the sword
thou that i can not now pray to my father and he shall presently give me more than twelve legions of angels but how then shall the scriptures be fulfilled that thus it must be
it was in fact necessary for to die in order for the truth to be known throughout the world so that later on when your creators return to earth they are not taken for or invaders
that is the purpose of the biblical and evangelical writings to preserve traces of the work and presence of your creators so that they will be recognized when they return
after his death was with the help of the creators and behold there was a great earthquake for the angel of descended from heaven and came and rolled back the stone from the door and sat upon it
his countenance was like lightning and his white as snow
 the creators took care of and revived him
and he said go ye therefore and teach all nations  teaching them to observe all things whatsoever i have commanded you
 mission was coming to an end so then after had spoken unto them he was received up into heaven
mark
the creators took him away after this last most important phrase t he role o f t he i they shall take up serpents and if they drink any deadly thing it shall not hurt them they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover
mark
this refers to humanity discovering and and developing surgery and so on as is happening now
in preparation for their arrival on earth the creators will appear more and more frequently in order to highlight these revelations
this also is happening right now
behold the fig tree  when they now shoot forth ye see and know of your own selves that summer is now nigh at hand
 when unidentified flying objects begin appearing in large numbers as they are doing at present it means that the time has come
in the acts of the apostles it says furthermore in chapter and when the day of was fully come they were all with one accord in one place
and suddenly there came a sound from heaven as of a rushing mighty wind and it filled all the house where they were sitting
and there appeared unto them tongues like as of fire and it sat upon each of them
and they were all filled with the holy spirit and began to speak with other tongues  acts
to make it possible for the apostles to spread the truth throughout the world the creators exposed them to a concentrated burst of teaching sent to them by amplified waves a little like electroshocks which their memories with elements of other languages
in the acts of the apostles note the numerous appearances made by the creators the angels particularly when they liberated who had been up by i f t he and behold the angel of came upon him and a light in the prison and he on the side and raised him up saying arise up quickly
and his chains fell off from his hands
and the angel said unto him gird and bind on thy sandals
and so he did
and he saith unto him cast thy garment about thee and follow me
and he went out and followed him and not that it was true which was done by the angel but thought he saw a vision
acts
primitive as he was thought he was having a vision as his chains fell off
he did not know about the electric welding torch which was being used by one of the creators
when such fantastic things happen people think they are dreaming
this is why it was often said that people who have seen the creators must have had a vision or seen them in a dream
in the same way it is said that people who have seen our flying saucers must have had hallucinations
in that quotation it is clearly explained that thought he had seen everything in a dream but in fact it was all very real
they came unto the iron gate that unto the city which opened to them of his own accord  and the angel departed from him
acts
another sign that the time has come is that the people of have regained their country after this i will return and will build again the of which is fallen down
acts
another important sentence is found in a following chapter for we are also his offspring
acts t he role o f t he i this was said by an apostle while speaking of god
we shall not continue to read further in the where there are many more references to the creators because they are less important
you can interpret them yourself for those who ask questions in the light of the explanations i have already given you
and saying that he left just as on previous occasions
first year of the new era he next day he returned just as before and started to speak the time of the end of the world has arrived
not the end of the world as in a catastrophe destroying the earth but the end of the world of the church which has completed its work
it performed this role more or less effectively
it was a task of making it possible for your creators to be recognized when they return
as you have noticed the church is dying
it is the end of this world because its mission has been fulfilled albeit with quite a few mistakes because it tried for so long to the creators
this deification was acceptable until the scientific age began
then it should have been removed completely
this would have been possible had the truth been preserved or if people had been able to read between the lines
but too many mistakes were made
this was foreseen by the creators and the church will collapse because it is no longer of any use
in scientifically developed countries people are already consumed by a kind of because they have nothing left to believe in
nobody can believe in a heavenly god any longer perched upon a cloud with a white beard omniscient and which is what the church wants us to do
neither can anybody believe in delightful little guardian angels nor in a devil with horns and hooves
so nobody knows what t he w f y ear o f t he n e to believe in any more
only a few young people have understood that love is essential
you have reached the golden age
people of the earth you fly in the heavens and your voices are carried to the four corners of the earth by means of radio waves
so the time has come for you to know the truth
as it has been everything is happening now that the earth has entered the age of
certain people have already written about this but no one believed them
some years ago your creators decided to start their work on earth and everything that has happened since was anticipated because the movement of the galaxy implies this knowledge
the age of was the age of and his fishermen and the age of which follows began in
this is the era in which the people of found their country again and it shall come to pass in that day  that there shall be the noise of a cry from the gate 
the gate of is the passageway into the age of
this is the moment when the sun rises over the earth on the day of the vernal in the of
the loud clamor is the sound accompanying this revelation
it is not by chance that you were born in
the end of the church this revelation thanks to the enlightenment it contains will bring back hope and happiness to people who are morose
but it will also hasten the fall of the church unless the church can understand its mistakes and place itself at the service of the truth
i f t he for the terrible one is brought to and the is consumed and all that watch for are cut off that make a man an offender for a word and lay a snare for him that in the gate and turn aside the just for a thing of
 it is the end of those people who want to make us believe in original sin and who want to make us feel guilty the end for people who lay traps for those who spread the truth at the end of the age of and the beginning of the age of the end of people who are trying to save the church as it existed while ousting the just those who speak of justice and those who write or preach the truth
they are like the people who crucified
such people were convinced that they were defending what was right without trying to understand and were frightened of being ruined and destroyed at the dawning of the age of
and the eyes of them that see shall not be dim and the ears of them that hear shall  the vile person shall be no more called liberal nor the said to be  for the vile person will speak and his heart will work to hypocrisy and to utter error against to make empty the soul of the hungry and he will cause the drink of the thirsty to fail
the instruments also of the are evil he wicked devices to destroy the poor with lying words even when the needy right
but the liberal liberal things and by liberal things shall he stand
 everyone in this case will understand the words the eyes of them that see shall not be dim
it is the church who speaks of and leaves empty the souls of those who are hungry for the t he w t he e o f t he it is the church which infamous plans to annihilate the poor so that those who are unable to understand or who dare not understand will remain faithful to it through the fear of sin or other such nonsensical things
while the poor try to plead their case those who lack the intelligence to seize the truth stand up for the lies of the church at the bidding
but those of noble mind those who loudly proclaim the truth they perform noble acts even though they may live without the approval of the agonizing church of man
have ye not known have ye not heard hath it not been told you from the beginning have ye not understood from the foundations of the earth
behold my servant whom i uphold mine elect in whom my soul i will put my spirit upon him he shall bring forth judgment to the nations
 you are the one who will spread the truth throughout the world this truth which has been revealed to you over the past few days
a bruised will he not break and a dimly burning wick will he not quench
 you will not be able to destroy the church and its lies completely but eventually it will fade out by itself
this extinction has been going on for some time
the wick is weakening
it has accomplished its mission and it is time for it to disappear
it has made mistakes and has enriched itself at the expense of the truth without trying to interpret it in a clear enough way for people of this era
but do not be too hard on it for thanks to the church the word of the which is a witness to the truth has spread throughout i f t he its mistakes have been great particularly when it injected too much of the supernatural into the truth and wrongly translated the scriptures in ordinary bibles
it replaced the term which refers to the creators with a singular term god whereas in fact in is the of
in this way the church transformed the creators into a single incomprehensible god
another mistake was to make people adore a wooden cross in memory of
a cross is not the
a piece of wood in the shape of a cross means nothing and none it to heart neither is there knowledge nor understanding to say i have burned part of it in the fire and have also baked bread upon the coals thereof i have roasted flesh and eaten and with the rest thereof shall i make an shall i bow down to a block of wood
the creation of the state of the return of the people to as it was predicted is a sign of the golden age i will bring thy seed from the east and gather thee from the west i will say to the north give up and to the south keep not back bring my sons from far and my daughters from the ends of the earth even every one that is called by my name for i have created him for my glory
 this is indeed the creation of the state of welcoming from the north and from the south
the preserved by the t he w t he o f t he o f i people bears witness to the coming of the creators as it is ye are my witnesses
 bring forth the blind people that have eyes and the deaf that have ears
let all the nations be gathered together and let the people be assembled who among them can declare this and us former things let them bring forth their witnesses that they may be justified or let them hear and say it is truth
ye are my witnesses saith and my servant whom i have chosen that ye may know and believe me and understand that i am he  therefore ye are my witnesses saith that i am
yea before the day was i am he
 ye are my witnesses
that is quite explicit it and i can tell you again on this day from ancient days i am one and the same thanks to the witness that you hold in your hand the
for a small moment have i forsaken thee but with great will i gather thee
 the people of have in fact regained their country after having participated in the truth
the time when humanity will overcome illness by scientific means is there shall be no more thence an infant of days nor an old man that hath not filled his days
 medicine now helps people triumph over illness and especially over infant mortality
i f t he in the lips of him that hath understanding wisdom is found but a rod is for the back of him that is void of understanding
proverbs
the mistakes of the church the church was sinful in making human beings feel guilty and making them pray without seeking to understand but when ye pray use not vain repetitions as the heathen do for they think that they shall be heard for their much speaking
 and despite the warning in the the church has also made itself too wealthy while it was written lay not up for yourselves treasures upon earth  no man can serve two masters for either he will hate the one and love the other or else he will hold to the one and despise the other
ye can not serve and
 provide neither gold nor silver nor brass in your purses nor for your journey neither two coats neither shoes nor yet
 but with their stupid rules and they respect their own t he w t he o f t he not that which into the mouth a man but that which cometh out of the mouth this a man
 how dare they these men who are only men indulge themselves in the wealth and luxury of the when the tell them to possess neither gold nor silver not even a spare coat how dare they preach goodness and said unto his disciples i say unto you it is hard for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of heaven
 for they bind heavy burdens and grievous to be borne and lay them on shoulders but they themselves will not move them with one of their fingers
but all their works they do for to be seen of men  and love the uppermost rooms at feasts  and greetings in the markets  for one is your master even and all you are brothers
and call no man your father on the earth for one is your father which is in heaven
neither be you called masters for one is your master even
but he that is greatest among you shall be your servant
 that is all written in their own
so how dare the church burden people with their so called sins which are only different concepts of morality and how dare they speak of goodness while living in in the when people are dying of hunger how dare they seek invitations and honors while preaching humility how dare they ask people to call them father your eminence or your when their expressly forbid all these things if tomorrow the pope took to the road as a the church would be revived but it would have a totally different humanitarian i f t he goal to that which it has pursued up to now namely the propagation of what must serve as proof for today
that mission is finished but the church can itself towards goodness by helping those who are unhappy by helping to spread the real truth of those writings which until now have been distorted or kept secret
in this way the generous spirit of many priests would find fulfillment
for that to happen the men of the should set an example by selling all their treasures to help finance underdeveloped countries
they should go to those countries and help people progress by offering practical help with their bare hands not just with the good word
it is unacceptable too that there are different categories of marriage and more particularly of according to a persons wealth
this is another mistake of the church
but the time has come
at the root of all religions it is not only in the and the that there are traces of the truth can be found in practically every religion
the especially is one of the richest in but it would not have been easy for you to get hold of one
if one day you can find a copy then you will be able to see that there are a great number of allusions to us
particularly noteworthy is a description in the of of the creators planet and the distance which separates it from earth
it is written that the height of the creator is and that the height of his heels is
the is a unit of measurement just like the which stands for the distance that light can travel in one second which is about kilometers
our planet is away from t he w at t he root o f a r earth or about nine thousand billion kilometers just a little less than a light year
by moving at the speed of light or kilometers per second you would take almost one year to reach our planet
with your present day rockets which travel at only kilometers per hour it would take you about years to reach our planet
so you can see that we have nothing to fear for the time being
we have the means to travel to earth from our planet in less than two months with an propulsion method which enables us to move at the speed of rays that are seven times faster than the speed of those rays carry us
to be carried by them we leave the optical window which is the spectrum of rays detected by the eye to tune into the carrying beam
that is why people on earth who have observed our have described them as becoming luminous then very brilliant white then blue and finally disappearing
obviously when a spacecraft goes beyond the speed of light it disappears and is no longer visible to the naked eye
that is the height of the creators heels the distance at which his heels so to speak rest on a planet
the creators own planet is from its sun a very big star or seventy billion eight hundred million kilometers
this is what is meant by the height of the creators
the is the closest book to the truth but almost all religious books to us with varying degrees of clarity
this is especially true in those countries where the creators had bases in the in the in where mythology also contains important as well as in the and religions and among the
it would take many pages to name all the religions and sects that testify in a more or less obscure way to our work
i f t he mankind a disease of the universe there now you know the truth
you must write it down and make it known throughout the world
if people on earth want us to give them the benefit of our experience and help them gain years of scientific knowledge they have to show us that they want to meet us and above all demonstrate that they deserve it and that all this can be done without any danger to us
if we give our knowledge to humanity we have to be sure they will make good use of it
our observations in recent years have not shown that wisdom rules the earth
certainly there has been progress but some people still die of hunger and a warlike spirit still exists throughout the world
we know that our arrival could improve many things and unite nations but we have to feel that people really want to see us and that they are truly starting to unify
we also have to feel that they really want to see us arrive knowing fully who we are and understanding the true meaning of our arrival
several times human have tried to chase our crafts taking us for enemies
you must tell them who we are so that we can show ourselves without any risk of either getting hurt or killed which is not the case at present or of creating a dangerous and murderous panic
some researchers want to contact us by radio but we do not respond because in this way they could locate our planet
on the other hand transmission times would be too long and our broadcasting system uses waves that your technology can not pick up because you have not yet discovered them
they are seven times faster than radio waves and we are experimenting with new waves that are one and a half times faster than that
progress continues and our own research continues for the purpose of understanding and relating to the large being of whom we are a part and on whose atoms we are parasites
these atoms are the planets and the stars
t he w a o f t he u in fact we have been able to discover that intelligent living beings in the infinitely small live on particles that are planets and suns to them
they ask the same questions as ourselves
humanity is a disease inside this gigantic being and the planets and stars are its atoms
also this same gigantic being is in its turn a parasite on other greater atoms
in both directions it is infinite
but the important thing is to make sure that the disease which is humanity continues to exist and never dies
we did not know when we were creating you that we were accomplishing a secondary mission written into us thus repeating what had been done for us
from what we created and how it has developed we have discovered our own origins
for we were also created by other people who have since disappeared
their world has quite certainly but thanks to them we were able to continue in their steps and create you
we may disappear one day but by then you will have replaced us and taken over our roles
so you are the link in the precious chain of human continuity
other worlds exist and humanity is certainly developing in other parts of the universe
but in this region of the universe our world is the only one to have made new creations
this is important because from each world innumerable children can be brought forth who are precious for preserving continuity
this allows us to hope that one day humanity will no longer be in danger of disappearing completely
but we are not sure that can ever stabilize itself in abundance
the chain has always continued but we must not upset the equilibrium of the immense body in which we are a parasite because by developing too much we could trigger a catastrophe which at best might bring about a recession and at worst cause complete destruction
in a healthy body a few germs can live without danger but if they develop too much they cause a disease which troubles the organism
then the organism reacts to destroy the germs responsible either naturally or with the help of medication
the important thing i f t he apparently is to create enough worlds so that humanity does not extinguish itself but above all else to make sure that the equilibrium is not broken by concentrating our efforts anew on seeking to make those who exist happier
it is in this area that we can help you tremendously
evolution a myth i make a here because you must dispel from your minds all uncertainty about evolution
your scientists who have elaborated theories of evolution are not completely wrong in saying that humanity is descended from the monkey and the monkey from the fish and so on
in reality the first living organism created on earth was which then gave rise to more complex life forms
but this did not happen by chance when we came to earth to create life we started by making very simple creations and then improved our techniques of environmental adaptation
this enabled us to make in turn fish mammals birds primates and finally man himself who is just an improved model of the monkey to which we added what makes us essentially human
in this way we made human beings in our image as it is written in the in genesis
you could have realized for yourselves that there is little chance of a series of accidents producing such a large variety of life forms the colors of birds and their elaborate mating rituals or the shape of certain antelope horns
what natural need could lead or wild to develop curled horns or birds to have blue or red feathers and what about exotic fish all that is the work of our artists
do not forget the artists when you yourselves create life
imagine a world without them no music films paintings or sculptures  life would be very boring and t he w e a animals very ugly if their bodies corresponded only to their needs and evolution of the various forms of life on earth is really the evolution of techniques of creation and the increased sophistication of the creators work
this eventually led them to create people similar to themselves
you can find the skulls of prehistoric men who were the first human
these were replaced each time by others more evolved
this continued right up to your present form which is the exact replica of your creators who were afraid to create anything highly superior to themselves although some were tempted to do so
if we could be sure that human beings would never turn against their creators to dominate or destroy them as has happened between the different human races created successively on earth but instead would love them as parents the temptation would be great to create an improved
this is possible but at what enormous risk in fact some creators worry that the people of the earth may be slightly superior to their fathers
is one of those who has always thought and still does that the people of the earth are a danger to our planet because they are a little too intelligent
but the majority among us thinks that you will prove to us that you love us and that you will never try to destroy us
that is the least we expect before coming to help you
it is even possible that at each creation of by a small improvement is achieved a true evolution of the human race which is gradual so that the creators do not feel threatened when faced with their creations
this makes it possible to speed up progress
although we do not think that at present we can give you our scientific heritage we do feel it is safe to give you our political and humanitarian knowledge
this will not threaten your planet but will allow you to be happier on earth
thanks to this happiness you will progress faster and that could also help you to show us more speedily that you deserve our help and our inheritance in striving to achieve an level of civilization
i f t he otherwise if humanity can not calm its aggressiveness if peace does not become your only goal and you allow people to promote war produce arms test nuclear weapons and maintain armies just to seize or retain power then we will stop such people from becoming a danger to us and there would be another and
how could we not fear people from earth when they attack their own we who are from another world and slightly different you you will spread the truth under your present name which you will replace progressively with which means literally light of god and if we translate it more accurately light of the or ambassador of the because you will be our ambassador on earth and we will come only officially to your embassy
can be simply translated as messenger
and it is through telepathy that we made you name your son which means the son of the one who brings light because he is truly the son of our messenger of our ambassador
and following that pronouncement he left just as he had done on other mornings
the new met him the next day and again he began to speak first of all let us look at the political and economic aspects of life
what kind of people allows humanity to progress the geniuses
therefore your world must its geniuses and allow them to govern the earth
power was in the hands of who were superior to others because of their muscular strength
next in power were the rich who used their money to employ many in their service
then came the politicians who the people of democratic countries with their own hopes not to mention military men whose success has been based around the rational organization of brutality
the only type of people you have never placed in power are the ones who help humanity to progress
whether they discovered the wheel gunpowder the internal combustion engine or the atom the geniuses have always allowed less intelligent people in power to benefit from their inventions
often such people have used peaceful inventions for murderous ends
all that must be changed
for this to happen you must abolish all your electoral and polling systems because in their present form they are completely unsuited to human development
each person is a useful cell in this huge body we call humanity
the cell in your foot should not decide whether or not your hand should pick up a given object
it is the brain which i f t he must decide and if the object in question is good the cell of your foot will benefit from it
it is not up to the foot to vote
its job is simply to transport the body including the brain and it is not capable of judging if what the hand takes is good or not
votes only have a positive effect when there is an equivalence of knowledge and intellect
was condemned by a majority of incompetent people because he was the only one at that time who had a sufficiently high level of comprehension
although the church that is to say the majority believed the earth was the center of the universe this turned out to be wrong
the earth really revolved around the sun and the minority turned out to be when the first cars were invented if we had asked everyone to vote to establish whether cars should be allowed to exist or not the majority who knew nothing about cars and did not care would have responded negatively and you would still be riding in a horse and cart
so how can you change all that these days you have psychologists who are capable of creating tests to evaluate the intelligence and adaptation of every individual
these tests should be applied systematically from infancy onward in order to define each individuals orientation towards subjects studied
when individuals reach a responsible age their intellectual coefficient can be measured and included on their identity or voters card
only those with an intellectual capacity of at least fifty per cent above the average should be eligible for a public post
to vote individuals would need an intellectual coefficient of at least ten per cent above average
if such a system existed now many of your present politicians would not hold the positions they do today
this is a totally democratic system
there are many engineers for example who are of lower than average intelligence but who have very good memories and have obtained several academic degrees because of this
on the other hand there are many laborers or farm workers who have no specialized education at all but whose intelligence is fifty per cent above the average
what is totally unacceptable now is that the t he n g voice of someone whom you might call a is worth as much as that of a genius who has thought about the way he or she is going to vote
in some small cities elections are won by the candidate who buys people the most drinks not by the individual whose policies are the most interesting
therefore right from the start the right to vote should be reserved for those people whose brains are more suited to thinking and finding solutions to problems that is to say an elite group of high intelligence
this does not necessarily mean those people who have done the most studying
we are talking about placing the genius in power and you may call that
second point your world is paralyzed by profit and communism fails to provide a carrot big enough to motivate people and encourage them to make progress
you are all born equal this is also written in the
your governments should ensure that people are born with approximately the same level of financial means
it is unacceptable that children of low intelligence should live in luxury thanks to the fortunes by their fathers while geniuses die of hunger and do any menial chore just to eat
this way they forsake occupations where they could have made discoveries the whole of humanity
to avoid this property ownership must be abolished without establishing communism
this world is not yours that also is written in the
you are only tenants
thus all goods should be rented for years
this will eliminate the injustice of inheritance
your true inheritance and that of your children is the entire world if you knew how to organize yourselves to make it pleasant
this political orientation of i f t he humanity is not communism its preoccupation is the future of humanity
if you want to give it a name call it
take for example a man who has finished his studies at the age of and wants to work
he chooses his profession and earns a salary
if he wants to find a place to live while his parents are still alive he buys a house but of course in reality he is renting a house or apartment for years from the state which constructed it
if the value of the house is estimated at francs he can pay that amount divided into monthly installments for years
at the age of seventy plus he will have paid for his house and can live there until his death without ever paying after his death the house will go back to the state which must then allow his children if there are any to benefit from it freely
supposing there is one child then this child can live freely all his life in his fathers house
at his death his child in turn can also benefit from the family house and so on indefinitely
inheritance must be completely abolished except for the family house
this does not however prevent each person from being rewarded individually for their merits
let us take another example
someone has two children
one is a good worker and the other is lazy
at the age of they both decide to go their own separate ways
they each rent a house worth francs
the worker will rapidly earn more money than the lazy one
he will then be able to rent a house worth twice as much as the first one
if he has the means he will even be able to rent both houses one as a country house
if his savings are fruitful he will also be able to build a house and rent it for years thereby receiving money due to him
but at his death everything will go back to the community except for the family home which will go to the children
t he n h thus individuals can make a fortune for themselves depending on their own merits but not for their children
to each their own merits
the same should apply to commercial and industrial enterprises
if someone creates a business it is theirs for their entire life and they can rent it out but never for more than years
the same goes for farmers
they can rent land and cultivate it for years but after that it all goes back to the state which will be able to rent it out again for another years
their children can also rent it for years
this method must be adopted for all goods that remain and as for the value of things nothing changes
everything that is of value such as shares gold enterprises cash or buildings is owned by the community but may be rented for years by those who have acquired the means by their own merits in this way somebody who made a fortune around the age of forty will be able to construct houses rent them as apartments for years and enjoy that money so long as life lasts
afterwards the money which comes from these rents will go back to the community
this is already prescribed in the and thou number seven of years unto thee seven times seven years and the space of the seven of years shall be unto thee forty and nine years
 and if thou sell ought unto thy or ought of thy neighbours hand ye shall not one another according to the number of years after the thou buy of thy and according unto the number of years of the fruits he shall sell unto thee according to the multitude of years thou increase the price thereof and according to the of years thou diminish the price of it for according to the number of the years of the fruits he sell unto thee
 i f t he the land shall not be sold for ever for the land is mine for ye are strangers and sojourners with me
 if geniuses are admitted to power they will understand the usefulness of these reforms
you must also see to it that all the nations of the earth unite to form only one government
world government the creation of a new worldwide currency and a common language would help you to establish a world government
the dialect is no longer spoken in and very soon will no longer be spoken in nor in nor in
your scientists and linguists should unite and create a new language inspired by all languages and made in all the schools of the world as a second language
the same must be done with money
worldwide currency values can not be based on the franc the dollar or the yen but must be based on a new currency created for the needs of the whole earth without depriving one group of people who would ask themselves why another currency has been chosen instead of their own
finally the trigger required to bring about such a union is the suppression of military conscription which teaches only aggressiveness to young men
professional armies must then be put at the service of the public
this must happen at the same time in all countries so as to provide an indispensable guarantee of security
t he n y our your mission as i have already told you we know that our official arrival would accelerate many things
but we will wait until we see that human beings really want us to come that they love us and respect us like the parents that we truly are and that our will not be threatened by your destructive military forces
to achieve this make it known throughout the world that you have met me and repeat what i have said to you
wise people will listen to you
many will take you for a madman or a but i have already explained to you what to think of the majority
you know the truth and we will stay in contact with you by telepathy to give you confidence and additional information if we think it is necessary
what we want is to see if there are enough wise people on earth
if a sufficiently large number of people follow you then we will come where at the place you will have prepared for our arrival
have a residence built in a pleasant country with a mild climate with seven rooms always ready to receive guests each with a separate bathroom a conference room able to accommodate people a swimming pool and a dining room capable of seating people
this residence should be constructed in the middle of a park and should be protected from curious onlookers
the park should be entirely surrounded by walls to prevent anyone from seeing the residence and the swimming pool
the residence should be situated at a distance of at least one thousand meters from the walls around the park
it will have a maximum of two stories and should be further screened from view by an inner barrier of trees and bushes
install two in the surrounding wall one to the south and another on the northern side
the residence will also have two
i f t he there will be a terrace on the roof where a spacecraft of twelve meters in diameter may land
access from that terrace to the interior is essential
the air space above and around the residence should not be under direct military or radar surveillance
you will try to ensure that the area where this residence is built if possible larger than here is treated as neutral territory by other nations and by the nation on whose territory it is located by virtue of it being our embassy on earth
you may live with your wife and children in the residence which will be under your direction and you will be able to have servants there and invite guests of your choosing
however the area containing the seven rooms should be directly under the terrace and it should be separated from the section used by human beings by a thick metal door from the inside which is kept permanently closed
an aseptic chamber should be built at the entrance to the conference room
the financing of the project will be made possible through the help you will receive from those people who will believe in you and therefore in us
they will be wise and intelligent and they will be rewarded when we come
keep a record therefore of those who contribute financially to the construction and upkeep of the residence however modest their contribution
also in each nation throughout the world appoint an individual who will be responsible for communicating the truth and who will help others join together to spread it
once a year on a mountain near the residence gather together from all over the world all those people who have heard about us through these writings and want us to come
assemble the largest number of people possible and have them think intensely about us and hope for our coming
when there are enough people and when they wish intensely enough for us to come without any religious mysticism but as responsible people respecting their creators then we will land openly t he n y our and give you our scientific knowledge as our heritage to all peoples of if those with warlike are rendered harmless all over the whole world then this will happen
if the love of life and love for us and itself are strong enough yes we will come we will wait and if human beings remain aggressive and continue to progress in a manner which is dangerous for other worlds then we will destroy this civilization and its repositories of scientific wealth and there will be another and until such time as humanity becomes morally worthy of its level of scientific understanding
the future of humanity is in its own hands and the truth is in communicate it throughout the world and do not be discouraged
we will never help you openly or in any way that would give proof to the skeptics since skepticism often goes hand in hand with aggressiveness
intelligent people will believe you since what you will say contains nothing mystical
it is important to us that they believe you without any material proof
this proves to us more than anything else that they are intelligent and so are worthy to receive our scientific knowledge
now go
you will not be forgotten if you succeed during your life on earth or even after
if necessary we can wait until the time of your descendants to make our landing because we can make you live again scientifically just as we can all those who have led humanity along the path of human genius guided by the love of their creators so long as their remains are preserved in or tombs
the only help we will give you will be to appear in the skies more and more frequently from now on in order to make people aware of the problems and make them want to learn more about the truth that you are transmitting
gradually thanks to these increased public awareness will also increase and our presence will no longer trigger stupid i f t he but instead a deep desire within the population to make contact with us
you will call your movement the movement for welcoming the creators of humanity which carries in its initials a message a et le which means preceded and the
in this is pour movement for a the welcoming des of the de creators of h humanity
nuclear weapons we leave each other for the last time he said do you have any questions to ask me you have interpreted the vision of as people equipped with space suits i replied and you told me that the atmosphere of your planet was not the same as that on earth
so why you wearing a suit now because we too have progressed scientifically and now we can do without them
my face seems to be in the open air but really it is protected by an invisible shield composed of repellent rays inside which i breathe different air from you
these rays let waves pass through but not air molecules
its a bit like the way you prevent fuel deposits escaping from certain ports in your technology by using of bubbles
are nuclear weapons a danger for humanity yes a great danger
but if humanity does not become wise and peaceful the existence of your nuclear weapons will mean that if the need arises we will not have much to do in bringing about the destruction of your civilization
perhaps you might even destroy yourselves
if you do not however and if you become a threat to us we will only have to destroy your stocks of bombs without sending offensive weapons against you
we could do this with either rays or telepathy i f t he in such a way that in effect one of the great powers would become the aggressor and this would automatically release a fatal retaliation
if people do not want to be exposed to that danger any longer all they have to do is take nuclear weapons away from the military
such nuclear power used with care could enable countries that lack energy to make great strides forward
you urgently need to stop nuclear weapons testing because you know nothing of the risks to which you are exposing yourselves
however if humanity continues to play with nuclear weapons it will simplify our task if we have to reduce you to silence
do you have any women on your planet yes it is mentioned in the and i made you note the appropriate quotation
and children also yes we can have children exactly like you
overpopulation you told me you were immortal in some way
how do you prevent over population this problem will in fact be making itself evident very rapidly on earth
to resolve it and you should resolve it immediately because you are already sufficiently numerous you must develop contraception and pass strict laws authorizing women to have no more than two children
if a couple has only two children the population will arrive at a point where it no longer increases
we will be watching how well you deal with this too
it will be another test of your intelligence which will help us see if you have earned our heritage
this solution i offer is for humanity now where people only live for years on average
for us the problem is very different
we are not eternal but we are able to live ten times longer than you thanks to a small t he e overpopulation surgical adjustment which in effect is the biblical tree of life
we have children and we observe the rules which i have just explained two parents two children
this keeps our population constant
how many of you are there we are a population of about seven billion
we have met on six consecutive days but did you always go back each time to your own planet no i returned to an ship which we use as a base and which stays constantly close to the earth
how many of you are on that vessel seven and on our planet there are seven provinces
each has a representative on that vessel
if we add the two who are responsible for the vessel there are permanently nine of us
if the people here on earth do exactly as you wish what will we will come officially and land at the residence which you will have prepared
we will ask you to invite there the official representatives of the most important countries of humanity in order to bring about total unification of the people on the earth
if all goes well we will allow humanity to benefit step by step from our scientific advances
depending on the uses that will be made of it we will see if we can give humanity all our knowledge and allow you to enter the era with our years of scientific progress as your inheritance
are you the only world to have attained such an advanced level in science in this region of the universe yes
there is an infinite number of worlds inhabited by beings of the type whose scientific level is lower than ours although much superior to yours
what makes us fearful of disappearing is the fact that we have not yet found any planet with a civilization as highly evolved as our own
we have economic relations with many other planets on which life has been created by other people who must have reached a scientific level equivalent to ours because their religious writings prove this to us
i f t he unfortunately we have been unable to find the civilizations who created the closest of these worlds
but perhaps we will find them farther on as we continue to search the universe each time moving further away
in most cases their planets approached the sun too closely and life became impossible or their sun exploded or became too cold
although we have not noticed anything abnormal at present in our system all this makes us fear the worst
so there is no religion where you live our only religion is human genius
we believe only in that and we particularly love the memory of our own creators whom we never saw again and whose world we have never been able to find
they must have disappeared
however they had taken the precaution of putting a huge space station in orbit around our planet containing all their knowledge and this landed automatically when their world was destroyed
thanks to them we have taken on the torch and we would like to see this torch taken up by the people of the earth
and what would happen if your planet was destroyed in case our world is destroyed the same arrangements have been made in advance so that you would automatically inherit all our knowledge
the secret of eternity do you really live ten times longer than we do i asked
our body lives on average ten times longer than yours he like the first people of the that is between and years
but our mind our true self can be truly immortal
i have already explained to you that starting with any cell of the body we can recreate the whole person with new living matter
when we are in full possession of our faculties and our brain is at its maximum level of efficiency and knowledge we remove a tiny sample t he e t he o f e of the body which we then preserve
then when we really die we take a cell from this preserved sample and recreate the body in full just as it had been at the time the sample was taken
i say as it had been at that time meaning with all its scientific knowledge and of course its personality
but in this case the body is made up of new elements with the potential for another one thousand years of life and so on
but in order to limit the growth of the population only geniuses have the right to eternity
everybody on our planet has a cell sample taken at a certain age hoping that they will be chosen for recreation after their death
in fact they not only hope for it they try to earn this resurrection during their life
once they have died a grand council of the to decide in a last judgement who among those who died during the year deserves to live another life
for a period of three the eternal is on probation and at the end of this time the council of the reconvenes to judge who in the light of their work deserves to join the council of the as a perpetual from the moment that one wishes to have a new life one no longer has the right to have children although this does not of course prevent love
this explains why the scientists who were members of the council of the wished to create life on other planets
they transferred their procreative instincts onto other planets
what do you call yourselves if you wish to give us a name even though we call ourselves men and women in our language you may call us since we did indeed come from the sky
what language do you speak on your planet our official language closely resembles ancient
each day we have talked here you afraid other people might have surprised us an automatic system would have warned me immediately if people had approached within a dangerous radius by air or by land
what is your and your work where you live i f t he most of our work is intellectual as our level of scientific development allows us to use robots for everything
we work only when we feel the inclination and then only with our brain
only our artists and our sports people work with their bodies and only because they have chosen this
our highly developed atomic energy is almost inexhaustible especially since we have discovered a way to use the atom in a closed circuit and solar energy
we also have many other sources of energy
we do not necessarily use uranium in our atomic reactors but several other simple and harmless materials
but if you live so long and do not work do you not get bored no never because we always do things we enjoy doing especially making love
we find our women very beautiful and we make the most of this
does marriage exist no
men and women are both free
couples exist
those who have chosen to live as such may do so but they may have their freedom back whenever they wish
we all love one another
jealousy does not exist since everyone can have everything and property is nonexistent
there is no criminality where we live thus no prisons and no police
however there are many doctors and regular medical visits for the mind
those who show the slightest sign of psychological imbalance that could threaten the life or liberty of others are immediately given treatment in order to bring them back to normal
can you describe the day of an average individual where you live in the morning they would get up and bathe since there are swimming pools everywhere have breakfast and then do whatever they feel like doing
everybody works but only because they feel like working as there is no money where we live
thus those who work always do it well since it is by vocation
only the have specific tasks for example supervising the electronic brains and computers used for dealing with vital functions such as energy food and organization
of the seven billion inhabitants there are only and they live entirely apart t he e t he o f e from the others
they have the privilege of being but with this goes the duty of doing everything for the others who are not obliged to work
to these we must add about seventy each year that is to say ten from each province
of the seven billion inhabitants there are only about forty million children
it is only when they become of age between eighteen and years depending on the individual that the children undergo the operation which gives them a life span of more than years
from then on they too may have children
this enables the oldest of our inhabitants to know their descendants for up to fifty generations
out of seven billion inhabitants there are only about one million inactive people and almost all of them are under treatment for psychological disorders
our doctors treat them for a period of six months
most people are interested in the arts and they paint play music write produce films and participate in sports  we have a leisure civilization in the full sense of the word
our cities have an average population of about people spread over a very small area
a city is in fact a huge house situated in a high place inside which people can sleep love and do whatever they please
these city houses are about one kilometer in length and height and are traversed in all directions by waves used by everyone for travelling
you tie on a belt and then place yourself in a wave current which transports you very rapidly to wherever you wish to go
the cities are in shape so that they do not eat up the countryside as they do where you live
indeed one of your cities with say a population of about covers a surface area twenty times greater than ours
the result is that when you want to go into the country you have to travel for many hours whereas in our case we are there in only tens of seconds
the same architect conceives an entire city so that it will be pleasing to the eye and will perfectly with the scenery surrounding it
but the people who have nothing to do get bored i f t he no because we provide them with numerous activities
the individuals true value is recognized and everyone wants to show that they have worth
whether it be in art in science or in sports each person wants to shine in order to become eternal or simply to be admired by the community or by a woman
some people like to take risks and to deprive them of the risk of dying would take away their joy of living and that is why dangerous sports are very popular
we can bring back to life any injured person but those who practice these sports may do so only if they state in writing that they agree not to be taken care of if they die during their sporting activities
we have a kind of atomic automobile race that would fascinate you and more violent activities like and even more violent than that a kind of game which is played in the nude and where everything is permitted wrestling and so on
all this may seem barbaric to you but do not forget that all extremes must be balanced to avoid breakdowns
an extremely sophisticated civilization must have primitive
if our people did not have their idols in their favorite sport they would have only one wish left to die
the life of another individual must be respected but their wish to die or to play with death must also be respected and permitted within well structured and well defined specialties
where we live contests are held each year in all branches of the various activities one of which is a worldwide contest permitting us to decide on the best individuals who deserve eternal life
everyone lives only for that
each year whether it be painting literature biology medicine or any other specialty where the human brain can express itself a competition takes place in every province with a vote from the of that province the champions are gathered in the capital to submit themselves to the vote of a jury of who designate those who become champions among champions
these people are then presented to the grand council of who finally choose those who are worthy of becoming eternal t he e t he o f e
this is the goal and ideal
distractions may well take on a primitive aspect when the supreme goal is so high
does this mean that the have a totally different way of life from the other inhabitants oh yes
they live apart in cities reserved for them and meet regularly to make decisions
how old are the oldest ones the oldest the president of the council of the is years old and you see him before you now
i have lived in bodies up to this day and i was the first one on whom this experiment was successfully carried out
that is why i am the president of the
i myself directed the creation of life on then your knowledge must be immeasurable yes i have accumulated quite a lot of knowledge and i will not be able to gain much more
it is in this way that the people on earth may be superior to us because the capacity of that part of the brain which accumulates information the memory is larger
human beings on earth will be able to accumulate more knowledge than us and therefore will advance further scientifically if they have the means
this is what those who oppose the council of
people on earth may progress faster than us if nothing stops chemical education the knowledge that students need to accumulate must be enormous and must take a very long time no
thanks to an important scientific discovery which in fact your scientists on earth are beginning to consider we can teach a student his lessons
your scientists have just discovered that i f t he if you inject the liquid from the memory of an educated rat into the brain of an uneducated rat it will learn what the other knew
we can transmit information by the injection of brain memory matter thus our children have almost no work to do
they regularly undergo of brain matter taken from people possessing the information necessary for instruction
therefore children only spend their time doing interesting things which they decide on themselves such as rebuilding the world in theory and fulfilling themselves in sports and the arts
you never have wars among the provinces of your world never
the sports are sufficiently developed to eliminate the war instinct
besides psychologically the fact that young people are able to risk their lives in games where systematically there are many deaths during each event the war instinct
this enables those who feel this instinct too intensely to satiate it at the peril of their own life without involving those who do not want to travel along such perilous paths
if on earth sports and games were more dangerous but organized it would greatly reduce the chances of creating international conflicts
are the seven provinces of your world similar no as on earth there are different races and cultures
our provinces were created and based on those races and cultures while respecting the freedom and independence of each one
would it be possible for a man from earth to visit your planet yes but you would have to wear a space suit adapted for your breathing
you could live without such a suit in a special residence where we have reproduced the atmosphere
there many people from earth live including and along with many other living of our creation
we will be able to bring all these people back to earth when the time comes to support your statements
why not bring them back at once because in your world if returned he would be placed in a psychiatric institution
imagine someone landing among you saying he is the
he would certainly be t he e e mocked and quickly locked up
if we intervened by performing scientific wonders to show he really was the that would bring back religions based on god
it would also lend support to the idea of the supernatural or the mystical and we do not want either
having said that the small man saluted me for the last time and told me that he would return only when all that he had asked of me was accomplished
then he climbed back aboard his machine and it took off and disappeared just as it had on other mornings
the movement what a story what a revelation after returning home and classifying and copying up the notes i had taken i realized the immensity of the task that had been entrusted to i felt i had little chance of carrying it out
but since it is not necessary to hope in order to embark on an undertaking i decided to do exactly what was asked of me even though i might be taken for a
after all if being a means having received the light then i am quite willing to be considered a
it is better to be called a and know the truth than to be called enlightened and not know the truth
i wish to emphasize to skeptics of all kinds that i never drink alcohol and sleep very well at night
one can neither dream for six consecutive days nor invent all this
to you who refuse to believe me i say watch the sky and you will see more and more sights that neither our scientists nor the military will be able to explain except by foolish aimed at saving reputations which they believe they would lose if the truth did not originate from someone in their closed circle
how could a scientist possibly not know i f t he those who condemned because he dared to say the earth was not the center of the universe could never admit that someone other than themselves could reveal all that
but all of you who have seen or will see unidentified flying objects which some people will explain away as dreams or weather balloons or even hallucinations and all of you who dare not talk about it for fear of being mocked it is only by getting together with those who believe that you will be able to speak freely
all these revelations brought me such a sense of wellbeing and such an inner in this world where we do not know what to believe where we can not believe in a white bearded god or in a devil and where official scientists can not give precise explanations of our origins and our goals
in the light of these amazing revelations everything becomes so clear and seems so simple
knowing that somewhere in the universe there is a planet full of people who created us similar to themselves who love us all the while fearing that their creations might surpass them is this not profoundly moving especially if one thinks that we will in turn be able to participate in the evolution of this humanity of which we are a part like them by creating life on other worlds
now that you have read this book that i have written in which i have tried to set out as clearly as possible all that was said to me if you simply think that i have a great imagination and that these writings were produced just to amuse you then i will be profoundly disappointed
but perhaps on the other hand these revelations will give you confidence in the future and allow you to understand the mystery of creation and the destiny of humanity
perhaps they will answer the many questions that you have asked yourselves at night ever since your childhood wondering why we exist and what our purpose is on this earth
if this happens i shall be very happy indeed
finally if you understand that all i have said here is the profound truth and wish as i do to see these people land here officially very soon to give us their heritage and if you want to play a part in t he e t he r realizing all that was asked of me then i will have fulfilled my mission in writing this book
if this is the case write to me and we will welcome you into the movement
we will build the residence that they desire and when we are numerous enough all over the world to wait for them with the respect and love that those who created us would have the right to demand then they will come and we will become the beneficiaries of their immense knowledge
to all of you who believe in god or in i say you were right in such a belief
even if you thought all was not exactly as the church would have you believe there was a foundation of truth
you were right to believe in the basis of the scriptures but wrong to sustain the church
if you continue to distribute your money to provide cardinals with the finest vestments and at your expense continue to authorize the existence of the military and their nuclear threat then it means that you wish to remain primitive and are not interested in entering the golden age to which we are now entitled
if however you wish to participate passively or actively according to your means in the creation and development of the movement take your pen and write to me
we will very soon be numerous enough to choose a piece of land on which the embassy will be built
if you still have doubts read the papers and look at the sky
you will see that of mysterious crafts are becoming more and more numerous and this will give you the courage to send your letter to me addressed to international movement cp
or by to headquartersraelorg took me to their planet my life until first encounter introduction hen i started this second book i wanted simply to relate what my life had been like before my fantastic encounter of to answer the many people who had asked what i had done before that time and secondly whether anything extraordinary had happened to me during my childhood that could have such a destiny
i was surprised myself as i searched my memories for even though i thought that nothing extraordinary had occurred at the beginning of my life i found scenes which formed a whole when put together and i saw that my life had really been guided for me to be what i was and to find myself where i did on
i had almost finished writing this account when the second encounter took place
consequently i have summed up my early memories briefly in order to give as much space as possible to the second part of this message and to provide a full account of this second contact which turned out to be even more fantastic than the i f t he two years have passed two years for almost two years now i have been trying somehow to radiate this truth which is too great for me
time goes by and i feel i am getting nowhere
yet little by little a solid core of people is forming around me people who understand that the book which tells the truth really does just that
there are seven hundred of them as i pen these lines and i understand how this is both few and many at the same time
few when we consider the four billion people who populate the earth and many when we consider how few people had decided after two years to follow the man who two thousand years ago had the equally heavy burden of being initiated and then initiating the primitive people of his time
who are these seven hundred are they as the would no doubt love to believe average who could be made to swallow anything not at all
some of them are university graduates or people holding in philosophy psychology theology sociology medicine physics chemistry
my admiration perhaps goes as much to those who have no degree since although they have not acquired knowledge through studying that would allow them to realize that living matter and people like us can be created scientifically they are still able to feel it intuitively as people capable of mastering matter and putting themselves in harmony with the universe that they are
i must say that i am optimistic on the whole and that i believe that i have so far accomplished the mission that has been entrusted to me
for whatever happens to me is up and running and nothing will ever be able to stop it
in two years i have given nearly forty lectures and since certain questions come up regularly i suppose some parts of the message need to be clarified
so i will try to do that in this work
first of all what path did i follow before the encounter of y l u t he f e t y ears h passed i have to admit i have only recently begun to look back on my life to figure out exactly how it had been guided for me to be available and ready to go into action on the spiritual psychic and emotional levels at that time
certain events in my childhood had never seemed to me to have the least meaning when taken separately but they did when taken now it all seems very clear to me and i am moved when i remember some things that i considered unimportant at the time they occurred
far be it from me to tell my life story in a way that suggests that each event in it was exceptional but it seems that many people want to know more about what had happened to me before
also rather than leave it to wagging tongues i would rather tell it all childhood a over as the child of an unknown father i can not say that i had a typical childhood
i was what is called a natural child as if all others were artificial children
my birth was an accident as it were at least for the little town of which is so devoutly that it is known as the world capital of the
furthermore the unknown father who was not totally unknown was apparently a refugee
what sacrilege my birth was concealed as much as possible not in a cave but in a clinic at nearby
it occurred on at about two in the morning and was a very difficult one
but the important thing is that i was conceived on
conception the moment when a being truly begins to exist and develop in the womb of its mother is the true date of birth for each individual
has been a very important date for almost i f t he two thousand years now
for those who believe in coincidences my life began with a coincidence
when we returned to my poor mother tried for quite a long while to pass me off as the son of a friend she was taking care of for a while to her father who even though he held it against her when he learned the truth proved to be the nicest of grandfathers to me during the short time i knew him
sadly he died when i was still a very young child
i was later told about how amused he looked when having seen him trim his fruit trees i took a pair of scissors to cut  his
i was raised by my grandmother and my aunt who were then and still are living together
they taught me to read and helped me take my first steps which i remember very clearly surely the earliest memory of my life
it was only very recently that my grandmother told me that in she saw a strange craft flying very quickly and over near her house
she had never dared tell anyone about it for fear of being accused of hallucinating
it was only after reading my book that she decided to talk to me about it  and at the same time she decided to join
her decision to join was in fact one of the most important forms of encouragement that i received
the pope of the in there was an old man of whom small children were afraid and of whom the grownups made fun
they nicknamed him because he had very long hair rolled up in a bun and a magnificent beard
he was always clad in a long cape that came down to his ankles and he lived about a hundred meters from the house where my mother had found a small apartment
he did not work and nobody y l u t he f e t he p o f t he knew how he could afford to live in the house in front of the municipal grammar school
as they got older the children lost their fear of him and like their parents started to make fun of him laughing and making faces as they followed at his heels
personally i did not enjoy playing with the others preferring to contemplate insects and look at books
i had passed this man in the street several times and had been surprised by his face which radiated great kindness and by the mischievous smile he wore whenever he looked at me
i did not know why but he did not scare me and i did not see anything about him
also i did not understand why the other children made fun of him
one afternoon i followed him curious about where he was going and saw him go into his house leaving open the door that led into a small very dark kitchen
i went closer and could see him sitting on a stool with the mischievous smile on his face as if he were expecting me
he motioned for me to come nearer
i went inside the house and moved towards him
he laid his hand on my head and i felt a strange sensation
at the same time he looked up in the air and uttered some words that i did not understand
after a few minutes had passed he let me go still without saying a word and still smiling the same mysterious smile
all this had me puzzled at the time but i very quickly forgot about it
it was only in the summer of when reading a book that my mother had lent me about the mysteries of that i learned that father the old man in question was the last that is the last living pope of the and that he had been dead for several years
then i recalled the scene from my childhood and thought again of the mysterious smile that the old man used to give me each time i passed him in the street which was every day since we had been virtually neighbors
i now know exactly who he was addressing when he looked up in the air and uttered those mysterious phrases just as i know exactly what the silent luminous machine was that my grandmother had seen
i f t he one other thing also comes to mind again
after the scene that took place at father house i went to sleep every evening counting up to nine a certain number of times
this is a number that has frequently come up in my life like a code that has been assigned to me
i have never been able to explain this sudden habit which began several years after i had learned to count much higher than nine and therefore could not have been the result of learning by
i was seven years old when this incident took at that time what mattered most to me were animals which i loved to draw all day long when i was not organizing snail races
i was fascinated by animal life and i dreamt then only of becoming an explorer so as to be able to get near the mysterious fauna of the virgin but at nine years of age the number nine again everything was to change
first of all i was discovering what was to become a true passion for me speed
speed that is on everything with wheels with or without an engine
speed and especially balance the sense of trajectory and the struggle against oneself against ones own reflexes in fact the ultimate mastery of mind over body
it started with wild downhill runs on a little bicycle with almost no brakes and i wonder how it was that i did not fall a single time
to things up i would position myself at the top of a hill and wait for a fast car to pass by
then i would launch into pursuit catch up with the car and pass it to the drivers great surprise and once at the bottom of the hill i would turn and go back to wait at the top for another car
a few months later i found myself by chance attending the tour de motor race and it was love at first sight
it was possible i y l u t he f e p then realized to know the joys of high speed without having to pedal back up a hill
and you could make it your job
i made up my mind the way you can when you are nine years old
i would be a driver
from that day on my life was centered only around motor racing
nothing else interested me and i did not see the point of learning all they taught me at school since i was going to be a racing driver
were replaced by serious motor magazines and i impatiently began counting off the years that separated me from the age when i could obtain a drivers license
it was also at the age of nine that i had my first experience of boarding school
my mother was in despair because i no longer wanted to do anything at school and i constantly told her that such learning was useless for motor racing drivers
so she decided to send me to the boarding school in
she hoped that without motor racing magazines i would apply myself to school work and in a way she was not far wrong
but i have very bad memories of that first boarding school almost certainly because i was too young when i was sent there
i remember that i spent many nights crying in a huge dormitory where what i now believe i missed most was the chance to be alone and meditate
this need which caused me to spend entire nights crying further increased my already great sensitivity as will any emotional or affectionate need that is denied
then i discovered poetry
i had always been more attracted to literature than to mathematics although only as an interested and passive reader
then came the desire the need to write in verse if possible
i remained uninterested in mathematics yet i had now achieved a solid average in that subject as in all others
but in language and especially writing i regularly came first as long as i liked the set subject
i even wrote an entire collection of poems and won first prize in a poetry competition
i f t he the most surprising thing was that even though i had not been baptized i was in a private boarding school run by monks with all the praying which that involves prayers before eating and going to bed before rising in the morning before studying and attending daily mass with communion
when after six months of daily communion the brethren discovered that i had not been baptized they seemed utterly horrified
i actually thought it was funny it was in fact the only part of their mass that i liked this free tasting of morsels of bread
it was also at the age of nine that i attained puberty
i enjoyed it very much and discovering unknown and secret pleasures which no other nine in the dormitory seemed yet to know about was some consolation for my incomplete solitude
finally it was at the age of nine that i fell in love for the first time and it was the intense kind of love that can seize children at that age
due to my improved classroom results my mother had agreed not to send me back to boarding school and i found myself in the fourth grade at the municipal grammar school in
there she was nine years old or almost and her name was
i was shy and blushed quite ridiculously
it took only a glance during a medical visit or perhaps a gesture of modesty to hide a nonexistent bosom from my eyes to release in me feelings of tenderness and a great desire to protect this apparently fragile being
the following year i found myself at the same school in the fifth grade in the company of my first love to whom i dared not even speak
still i managed to end up sitting one desk in front of her at the beginning of the school year so that i could turn my head from time to time and admire her beloved face
i was only ten and was always thinking about her
the fact that i was close to her in class spurred me on and i set myself to work hard enough to avoid having to repeat a year
in this way i moved up to the sixth grade without the least interest in my unfortunately we were now constantly changing classes and had different teachers instead of just one
as a result i was almost always y l u t he f e p separated from her and did practically no work so much so that the next year i found myself back in a boarding school in the small village of which is about thirty kilometers from
it was even worse there than it had been at
we were all crammed into a tiny dormitory that was barely heated
and worst of all there was virtually no discipline
so the biggest and strongest boys enforced their own law
i think that is where i developed such a hatred of violence
one day fed up with being by boys against whom no measures were ever taken i took to the road on foot determined to cover the thirty kilometers that separated me from my maternal home
nobody noticed my departure and when the school principal caught up with me in his car i had already walked nearly ten kilometers
to my great delight i was kicked out of the school and sent back to the brethren at in the middle of the school year as a day boy
what joy i could now see every day in the street
by then she was twelve her small bosom was budding deliciously and to me she was more beautiful than ever
i grew less and less interested in my studies and began to taste the joys of playing truant mainly because i did not like finding myself back among the priests who had quickly advised my mother to have me baptized
fortunately she preferred to wait until i was old enough to understand so that she could ask my opinion
what i would have liked at that time was to become a garage mechanic because i had learned that this was a useful skill for racing drivers
my mother who hoped i would become an engineer wanted me at all costs to continue with my studies so she would not allow me to become apprenticed to a garage
this new gave me the desire to write poems again and i started pacing about in the country with a notebook in my hand instead of attending classes
at fourteen i found myself back in boarding school once more this time in at a grammar school where they take children not wanted by any of the other schools in the region
i f t he i found myself in the company of a fairly interesting collection of and hard cases
it was one of the latter a typical boarding school big shot who ended up being responsible for the direction i took during the next ten years of my life
his name was and he played the electric guitar which quite impressed me
as soon as the holidays came i got my grandmother to buy me a magnificent guitar and taught me a few chords
then i started setting my poems to music and noticed that it was apparently very pleasing to those who listened
as soon as the summer holidays came i began to enter some radio singing contests which i almost always won
it was also during that summer vacation that i discovered physical love for the first time with a who had been enchanted by my songs
she was twenty years old and did not teach me much apart from the effects that the guitar can have on women
the following year i was fifteen and wanted more than ever to live my own life
one day i took my guitar under my arm along with a small suitcase said farewell to the boarding school with its uninteresting studies and to
i had two thousand old francs in my pocket and a heart full of hope
at last i was going to earn my own living save up enough money to take my driving test at the age of eighteen and become a racing driver
by a stroke of luck a man driving a car that had tremendous acceleration hidden beneath picked me up
when he told me he was a racing driver and gave me his name i was able to tell him which car he had driven and the awards he had won
he was flattered and surprised little known as he was to meet a young boy who remembered all his achievements
he told me that he had once been a clown and that he now owned a garage in the southwest
when we arrived in he invited me out to dinner and even offered me a room in the hotel where he was staying
in the lounge we chatted a bit with two young women who were dance hostesses in a bar and had finished their days work
i sang some songs and then we went to bed each with one of our charming companions
there i was truly initiated into physical
y l u t he f e p the next morning i left discreetly because i wanted to find a room and some that would be interested in my songs
i did not find either and spent my second night in in the subway with the i had not a penny left and the next morning i was starving
i spent my day and despairing of ever sorting anything out
but that evening i saw a man playing an accordion on a cafe terrace and the customers were throwing him coins
i decided to try the same thing and right from the start it worked very well
i was saved
i lived like that for three years often sleeping anywhere and eating a sandwich from time to time
but i made enormous progress and one day i was hired by a small cabaret on the left bank
i made ten francs each night and needed fifteen for the taxi ride back to where i lived in a small room
yet i had my name on the poster although in small print already i was imagining my name high up on the poster in big letters seeing the success i was having every night
one day i met the actor who advised me to take acting classes to improve my stage presence
since i did not have the means to pay for them he kindly arranged for me to attend a course at the national theatre of free of charge
so for three months i took the course and then gave it up because i did not feel at all attracted to the theatre
i used to introduce myself at the time under the pseudonym of which i had chosen as a tribute to the and champion racing driver
i modified the spelling so that my initials would become c retaining my real first name
i began to win a lot of radio contests and by singing in several i was able to live reasonably well and more importantly to save up enough money to take my driving test at exactly eighteen as but that was not enough to become a racing driver
first i had to make a name for myself in the hope of being hired by a major company and for that i needed to have a competition car participate in some races independently and if possible win them
a racing car i f t he is very expensive and i had to continue saving in the hope of acquiring such a vehicle
i continued with my singing and tried to put some money aside
many friends had made recordings and seemed to be making a lot of money from them
so i decided to try it having by now more than songs in my bag
the first recording firm that i approached offered me a contract which i signed
the director of the recording firm was the director of the radio station no
which had launched a tremendous number of famous singers
my first record was fairly successful and the second thanks to a song called le et la honey and was even more popular
it was often heard on the radio honey and i smell honey and i smell vanilla and love i smell honey and girls ill always adore
the first was a was her name we played the pipes as the moon lit the night i took the road to her eyes and followed the way to her hair
the second was a blonde her name was the path around her curves i remember well i took the road to her eyes and followed the way to her hair
the third was a redhead she was called for her lovely little face and her frothy i took the road to her eyes and followed the way to her hair
y l u t he f e p cry my friend for tomorrow will be spring they are so lovely and not twenty yet i took the road to her eyes and you can travel the path to her hair
i was giving many performances and taking part in many road shows
everything was going well and i even had the pleasure of being selected to participate in the golden rose song contest held in but those who were guiding me did not really want me to become too famous an artist
that stage of my life had been planned to develop my sensitivity and to me to expressing myself in public but no more than that
even though the fact that i was among the contestants selected for the golden rose was being announced on the radio every morning came to me one day and explained that he had to withdraw me from the contest
he said that i would understand why later but he could not tell me more at that moment
so in the end i did not participate in that golden rose contest but had to continue to live on what i could earn from my singing which i realized would never be enough to buy a car that would get me into racing
therefore when i was offered the opportunity to become a representative for the company where i did my recording i accepted immediately convinced that i would be able to save up enough for a car in a few months
i found myself back in where i was a commercial agent in charge of fifteen regions
i stayed there for a year and left when at last i had enough money to buy myself a competition car
i just had time to break that car in before a friend wrote it off in an accident
however i had composed new songs during the year in and a wealthy friend urged me to make another record which he would finance himself
i f t he i spent another year living on my poetry and then as if to make me change my radically i was involved in a very serious car on a very tiring tour i fell asleep at the wheel of my car and struck a wall head on at about per hour mph
more than ten people had already died at that spot
i came out of it with several fractures but alive
i was for three months or more and my savings ran out
i was still not racing
i who had dreamt of starting out at eighteen had still not entered a single race by the age of
having been to racing circuits many times as a spectator i had noticed how young people were with this sport and also the number of boys who wanted to be racing drivers without knowing how to proceed
i did not know much more than they did and told myself that the best way for me to enter the racing scene would be to find a career that took advantage of their enthusiasm
i knew how to write so the solution was obvious
i would become a reporter for a sports car magazine
i got in touch with a number of specialist magazines but in vain because so many other young people had come up with the same idea
then i noticed a small advertisement in the motor section of l from someone looking for no experience required
i wrote and the replied saying that my application was being considered but that i had to send francs for administrative costs
in exchange i would receive some film to make a test report on a subject of my choice
i sent the money got back the film wrote the report on a motor race of course and immediately sent it to the address indicated
very soon afterwards i received a letter asking me to call a number in where the head office of the firm that had placed the advertisement was situated
i met the head of the publishing company a man of about thirty years of age who claimed to have made a fortune in photography in the united states
y l u t he f e p he seemed to be very interested in my ideas about the creation of a sports car magazine intended for young people who hoped to become racing drivers and offered to hire me as of a newspaper that was to come out in a few months time
he showed me the factory that he was going to buy to set up his printing office introduced me to the printer in whom he had hired to be the director and showed me the house where my wife and i could live at a stones throw from my office
i replied that it would suit me provided i could cover and participate in races
he then told me that he was also looking for someone capable of running a department since he intended to launch the new newspaper by racing some cars painted in his own colors
that would enable me to be right where the action was and i agreed to be the director of the department for this company
a week later i moved from to with my wife
i had been married for about three months and she was expecting our daughter
i had met in the month of and we had not left each others side since the first day we met
we had married three months later only because her family was shocked to learn that we had no intention of getting married religiously
her family was very and at first i prayed with them before my stay in however lasted only two months and i received no salary
it transpired that the rich who had wanted to create a newspaper had in fact just come out of prison without a penny
he had swindled sums of money ranging from francs to francs from more than young people dreaming like me of becoming racing drivers or
i had worked two months for nothing and i found myself full of ideas but penniless
this time i decided to make a start alone in the great world of publishing
i moved to close to my mother who was then looking forward to becoming a very soon and started my own publishing house to produce a magazine in my own way
this magazine was soon born thanks to a i f t he printer who also loved sports cars and who agreed to take the risk of extending me credit although i could not give him any form of the magazine took off quickly and soon became one of the leaders in its field
i reserved for myself the most interesting task test driving new models on the magnificent circuit of at and on the road
by this means i gained entry into the world of motor sport and cars were lent to me to race
at last my dream was becoming a reality and what is more i found from the start that i was a gifted competition driver gaining many victories with cars that were unfamiliar to me
for three marvelous years i lived like this all the time making continuous progress with my driving technique and concentrating per cent on the field that i loved that of sports cars
i must say that i felt a real pleasure in steadily pushing back my limitations and constantly improving control of my reflexes and reactions
however i did not care for either engine noise or the smell of burning fuel and i dreamed of days to come when racing car manufacturers would be required to make their cars and noiseless
only then could i enjoy fully the sensation of driving at its purest level
but all this was turned upside down towards the end of
the encounter on that extraordinary day i found myself in a crater of an volcano the
there as i have already described i met for the first time an extraterrestrial man or more precisely the singular of whom i would meet at the same place for six consecutive days and who for about one hour each time would dictate to me the fantastic revelations of the book which tells the truth
y l u t he f e t he e for the first few days following this experience i must confess i wondered if i would dare tell anyone at all about it
the first thing i did was to make a neat copy of the notes that i had taken as best i could although far too quickly as my interlocutor spoke to me
when this was finished i sent the original manuscript to a serious publisher who to my knowledge did not publish esoteric works or science fiction
obviously i did not want this message of such importance to humanity to be lost among collections of mysterious adventure stories or books that cater for people interested in alternative sciences
who ran the publishing house invited me to and told me that the manuscript was sensational
but he said that i must tell my life story before talking about the message and that there might be a few little changes to be made
all that was absolutely out of the question
i did not want to take up a hundred pages telling my life story and then present the message that i had received as if my personality were as important as those things which i had been asked to reveal
i wanted the message published but only the message even if it was not a thick book and thereby lacked interest for a publisher
so i asked to return my manuscript
he replied that he did not have it because a reader had borrowed it but that as soon as it was returned he would mail it to me
i had just returned to when i received a telegram inviting me to return to to appear in a television show named the great chess board presented by chancel
he was the director of a series in the publishing house to which i had sent my manuscript
he had read it and understood that it was absolutely fantastic whether anyone believed it or not
so i took part in the show and the thousands of letters that i received afterwards showed that while some laughed many had taken what i said very seriously and wanted to help
but days went by and my manuscript was not returned
i sent a registered letter to the publisher who replied that the manuscript would be sent to me but that they had not yet found it
after ten i f t he days i went back to to see if i could do something personally because nobody wanted to answer my questions any more when i telephoned to ask about the matter
the famous designer who had contacted me after the television show because he was interested agreed to come with me to see the publisher in order to find out what exactly had become of the manuscript
told us that the reader who had the manuscript had taken it with him on holiday but they did not know where he was or how to reach him
the situation was becoming stranger and stranger
in the end the manuscript was retrieved by and he returned it to me personally
i still wonder if it had really been lost or just put away to prevent it from being published
if that publishing house really the manuscript so easily then i would discourage other authors from sending their originals to them
alarmed by the mishap and by the growing pile of letters from people interested in buying the book containing the message as soon as it was published offered to leave her nursing job to help me with the publishing and distribution of this exceptional i accepted because i was sure that this way i would have permanent control over the use of these writings
since it was incompatible with the seriousness of the mission that i had been given i immediately stopped working for the sports magazine and in the autumn of the book finally rolled off the printing press
the shock to my nervous system caused by this unforeseen upset in my life had given me stomach pains and almost brought on an ulcer
all winter i suffered from a serious case of
no medication was effective and it was only after i decided to take it easy by doing some meditation and breathing exercises that the pains vanished as if by magic
in i had been on a television show by
it was called evening and sarcastic as always disguised his as a with pink y l u t he f e t he e antennae and a green suit and asked me if he looked like the person but many people interested by the little i had been able to say wrote to him for his lack of seriousness
confronted by the thousands of letters he received he decided to invite me back to do another show where i would be able to say a little more
convinced that i would not be allowed to say enough i decided to hire the hall for a date just after the television show and to announce to interested viewers that i would give a talk there in a few days time
i hired a hall to seat with an option on another to seat as i did not know how many people would want to bother to come and listen to me
in the end more than people came
quite obviously we could only accommodate in the hall i had booked and when these seats were filled we advised the others that i would give another talk in a few days in the great hall with seats
obviously many people were not happy to leave some of them having traveled several hundred kilometers
in the end everything went well and i found that a great number of people were ready to help and support me apart of course from those cynics whose questions by virtue of their superficiality i was able to show up as ridiculous
even though i had dreadful stage fright much more than i had ever had when singing everything went without a hitch and the answers to the most difficult questions seemed to come to my lips by themselves
i really felt help coming from above just as the had promised me
i had the impression of listening to myself give answers that i could not possibly have come up with alone
the second talk took place a few days later
i was afraid that those who had not been able to get into the hall the first time would not come back and that i would therefore find myself stuck with a very expensive hall nearly three quarters empty especially since there had not been any publicity about it since the television program except for a short paragraph in the only newspaper that would agree to this second talk
i f t he in the end well over two thousand people came and the hall was full
it was a triumph
from this time onward i did not have any further doubts about the success of my mission
the public talks from the month of onwards over the course of some forty lectures i was able to see which questions came up most frequently
i also saw the membership of rising constantly as regional offices formed in all the big towns of around the most dynamic and active members
i also saw some reporters pursuing their craft honestly and well their job being to inform the public by writing or saying exactly what they had seen or read about
however some like those from the newspaper le point wrote lies
even after registered letters were sent to remind them that they had to an inaccurate article in conformity with the right to respond they did not do so properly
others like those at the newspaper la simply refused to inform their readers that i was giving a talk in and exploited the fact that they were the only daily newspaper in that region
their news director had in fact met me and said that never would my activities or i be mentioned in his newspaper
all this was because they did not like the fact that when i appeared initially on television i had not first informed them before talking to a major broadcasting organization a sad story and a fine example of freedom of speech
they even refused to run a paid advertisement announcing that talk although in the same newspaper there were advertisements for pornographic movies
as for the newspaper le point it simply transformed an excursion of members to the place where the encounter had occurred into a broken appointment with the
y l u t he f e t he p talks these tricks were played in an attempt to ridicule an organization trying to get off the ground
it is evidently easier and less dangerous for a newspaper with an extensive to do this to a new organization like than to the church with its years of
but the day will come when those who have tried to hide or twist the truth will regret their mistakes
the second encounter the sighting of t was during that i decided to resign as president of first of all because it seemed that the movement could now manage very well without me and secondly because i thought i had made a mistake in structuring the organization in accordance with a law that likened the movement which is of such importance to humanity to a club or a war veterans association
i thought it was necessary to create a movement more in harmony with the fantastic message the had transmitted to me
this required a movement that respected to the letter what our creators had advised namely the renunciation of all religious practices and so on
any association based on that law ran contrary to the meaning of the message by definition at least in the way we had structured it
since all members of such an association could vote we were not respecting the principles of according to which only the most intelligent people may take part in making decisions
so i had to correct this fundamental mistake not by going so far as to abolish but rather by transforming it pending more effective modification of its structure
this would not run contrary to the regulations of the law
t he e t he in this way would become an organization that would support the real movement that i was going to create with its most members in effect a congregation of guides
this new association would bring together those people who wished to open others minds to infinity and eternity and become guides for humanity by scrupulously applying what was required in the message
so in a society seeking to close peoples minds in every way with religions education unthinking television programs and petty political battles i was going to try to initiate people who would go out into the world and attempt to open the minds of others
thus would retain its importance by becoming a support organization that would be the first point of contact for those discovering the message
it would be made up of practicing members and the congregation of guides was going to be a movement made up of monks guiding those practicing i knew that there were people among the members who were quite capable of managing the organization and i received confirmation of this during the elections to the administrative council
my replacement as president was a physicist with a promising future and the rest of the council was made up of people who were all equally representative and competent
it was also in the month of that one of the most devoted members and one of the most came to see me in
i told him about my desire to find a country house in as secluded a place as possible in order to rest a little and calmly write a book in which i would relate all that had happened to me prior to before anyone could invent a lot of nonsense about my past
he told me that he had a farm in an out of the way place in and that if i liked the area i could spend a month or two there and even stay as long as i wished since nobody lived there
we immediately drove off to visit the place and inspired by the peace and quiet that i found there i decided to stay for two months
i f t he after two weeks i was enjoying it so much that i seriously considered settling there more permanently
came back to join us at the end of and we started planning the move for the day after a celebration meeting at on the of august
i still had not decided for sure because i was afraid i might fail in my mission somehow if i moved away from the place of my marvelous encounter
however on while my wife and i were out getting some fresh air we saw what must have been an enormous craft passing silently and with jerky movements almost over the house
at times it moved with unimaginable speed but it also stopped suddenly several times proceeding in a pattern like this about meters from where we stood
i was delighted that other people were with me to witness the event and an indescribable feeling of happiness came over me
told me that the hairs on his head stood on end from emotion
to me it was an obvious sign of the consent to my moving to that area
the next morning i noticed that i had a strange mark on the bicep of one arm close to the fold of my elbow
i did not immediately make the connection to the sighting of the day before but later many people told me that it could only have been a mark made by the
it was a red circle about three centimeters in diameter its circumference was five thick and inside it were three smaller circlesfig
this mark stayed the same for the next two weeks then the three circles in the middle merged into one making two concentric circlesfig
then after another two weeks the two circles disappeared leaving a white spot on my arm which i still have
i wish to emphasize the fact that i never suffered from that mark and that i did not feel the least itching during the entire time i had it
some scientists to whom i showed the mark speculated that it could have been made while a sample was being taken with the help of a perfected
t he e t he the reunion of august finally took place as planned in the crater of near and at that meeting a splendid feeling of fraternity and harmony prevailed
i had decided to hold this gathering of members on this date without really knowing why but in fact the had guided me because on the day of the meeting some members informed me that it was the thirtieth anniversary to the day of the atomic bomb explosion at and that it was also a holiday the
fools will say that it was a coincidence
after that meeting some members helped me to move and i settled down to live in
the message part two on at around eleven at night i felt a sudden urge to go out and look at the sky
i dressed warmly because it was rather cool and set out walking in the dark
i was going in a certain direction without being conscious of it and suddenly felt the need to go to a spot that had shown me during the summer a i f t he deserted place between two and surrounded by forest
it was called the
i reached it around midnight half wondering what i was doing there but following my intuition since i had been told that i could be guided telepathically
the sky was magnificent and stars were shining everywhere for there was not a single cloud to be seen
as i stood watching the shooting stars the whole countryside suddenly lit up and i saw a huge ball of fire like a spark appear behind some bushes
i moved towards the place where the ball of fire had appeared filled with a tremendous joy as i was almost certain of what i was going to find
the same craft that i had seen on six occasions in the month of was there in front of me and the same person i had met two years earlier came towards me with a smile full of kindness
i noticed one difference right away
he no longer had on the spacesuit that had seemed to make a halo around his face the first time
after all the time i had spent trying to make the world understand that i was indeed telling the truth i was wonderfully happy to see once more the person who had been responsible for turning my life upside down
i bowed before him and he spoke
stand up and follow me he said
we are very satisfied with you and with everything you have done for the past two years
it is now time to pass on to the next stage since you have proven to us that we can trust you
these two years were in fact just a trial
you can see that today i have no protection around my face and that my craft appeared to you all at once and was not equipped with flashing lights
all of that was only intended to reassure you so that i would appear in a way that corresponds to the image that you generally have of space travelers
but now that you are sufficiently evolved not to take fright we wont use such approach techniques any more
following him inside the craft i noticed that its interior looked very similar to what i had found at our first meeting walls with the same metallic appearance as the outside no control board or instruments no and a floor made of a translucent blue substance on which stood two armchairs
these were made of a t he e t he part t transparent material that reminded me a little of plastic chairs but without feeling unpleasant
site of second encounter le near region he invited me to sit down in one of the two chairs settled into the other and asked me not to move
he then pronounced a few words in an incomprehensible language and i seemed to feel the machine rock slightly
then all of a sudden i felt a sensation of severe cold as i f t he if my whole body were turning into a block of ice or rather as if thousands of ice crystals were penetrating all the pores of my skin right down to the marrow of my bones
it lasted a very short time a few seconds perhaps and i felt nothing after that
then my companion rose and said you may come we have arrived
i followed him down the small stairway
the craft stood motionless in a circular room about fifteen meters in diameter and ten meters high
a door opened and my guide told me to go in and completely
after that i would receive further instructions
i went into a new circular room that did not have the slightest angle and must have been about four meters in diameter
i undressed and a voice told me to go into the room that was in front at that moment a door opened and i went into a room similar to the one where i had left my clothes but it was long and a little like a corridor
along the length of that corridor i passed under lights of different colors in turn
the voice then told me that by following the arrows painted on the floor i would arrive in yet another room where a bath awaited me
in this next room i did indeed find a sunken bathtub
the water was lukewarm just right and discreetly perfumed
the voice advised me to satisfy my personal needs which i did and then it asked me to drink the contents of a glass located on a small shelf by the metallic wall
it was a white liquid deliciously savored with almonds and very cold
then some soft clothes that felt like silk were offered to me
they were white very close fitting and had been laid out ready for me on another shelf
at last a final door opened and i found my guide again
he was escorted by two people who were of similar appearance to him but with different features and they were every bit as welcoming
i them in a huge hall where i found wonder after wonder
it was arranged on several levels and must have measured meters in diameter
it was covered by an absolutely transparent dome so transparent that at first sight it was not clear even that it was a dome
t he e t he part t thousands of stars studded the dark sky and yet the entire hall was brightly lit with a soft natural looking light as if it were midday
the floor was covered with furs and shaggy carpets of astounding enchanting colors
the most admirable works of art were everywhere each one more beautiful than the last and some had animated and changing colors
elsewhere there were plants some bright red and others blue as beautiful as exotic fish but several meters tall
background music was playing that sounded like an organ and a musical saw with occasional and bass voices producing extraordinary
this music made the flowers bend and sway in rhythm and they changed colors with each change of musical style
every time someone spoke the music grew softer so that we could hear each other without difficulty and without having to raise our voices
the air was perfumed with a thousand that also changed with the music and our positions in the room
the whole area had been designed with about ten corners which were separated at different levels and each corner had a particular character
a small stream meandered through all this
my guides two companions were showing him great respect and the next thing he said to me was follow me
we shall make ourselves comfortable since i have many things to tell you
i followed him to a group of armchairs and sofas made of a very soft black fur where all four of us sat down
there my guide spoke today i am going to give you a second message that will complete the one that i dictated to you in
you have anything to take notes with but worry everything that i say to you will remain engraved in your mind because here we have a technique that allows you to remember everything you hear
first of all we wish to congratulate you for all that you have done over the past two years but we also wish to warn you that the rest of your mission may be more difficult
but never be discouraged in any case because you will be rewarded for your efforts whatever happens i f t he to begin with we must correct a passage in the first message we gave you that you wrongly transcribed concerning an eventual intervention on our part to destroy humanity
it must be made clear that we will not intervene
humanity is now arriving at a turning point in its history and its future depends only on itself
if you can control your aggressiveness towards each other and your environment then you will reach a golden age of interplanetary civilization in which universal happiness and fulfillment will be realized
if on the other hand your civilization gives way to violence then it will destroy itself either directly or indirectly through all this
no scientific or technical problem is insurmountable for human genius as long as human genius is in control
but someone with a deficient brain can threaten worldwide peace just as a person of genius can bring the world happiness
the sooner you set up the sooner you will remove the possibility of a caused by people with minds that are not very evolved
in the event of a destroying humanity only the people who follow you will be saved and they will have to the devastated earth when all the danger has been dispersed as happened in time
my guide continued explains that at the time of death the soul of the dead person must be vigilant enough to escape numerous devils otherwise it will be reincarnated and fall back into the cycle
on the other hand if it manages to escape those infamous devils it will be liberated from the cycle and attain a state of bliss through awakening
in fact this is a very good description which applies not to the individual but to humanity as a whole
it must resist those devils which can make it fall back into the cycle each time it is in a position t he e b to choose
those devils are aggressiveness directed against our fellow human beings or against nature and the state of bliss through awakening is a golden age of civilization in which science serves the people thus producing an earthly paradise where the blind can see and the deaf can hear by scientific means
if humanity is not sufficiently wary of these devils it will fall back into the cycle of where it must start all over again from a primitive state and advance progressively towards a more evolved society in a hostile world with all the suffering which that entails
that is why we can find the swastika in our symbol as in numerous ancient writings which signifies the cycle
it is the choice between paradise which the peaceful use of science makes possible and the hell of returning to the primitive stage where humanity submits to nature instead of dominating and from it
in a way this is natural selection at the cosmic level for species that are capable of leaving their planet
only those who perfectly control their aggressiveness can reach this stage
the others as soon as their scientific and technological levels permit them to invent weapons powerful enough to do so
that is why we never fear those who come from elsewhere to contact us
thousands of contacts have confirmed this absolute rule in the universe people capable of escaping their planetary system are always peaceful
when a species is capable of leaving its own solar system it means that it has overcome the cycle that can occur when mastery of its own aggressive tendencies is lacking
at the same time that you discover powerful energy sources allowing you to travel beyond your own solar system you also become capable of creating offensive weapons of irreversible destructive power
your region of the terrestrial globe is already on the right track in its attempt to unite and it should be the first country without an army
would thus set an example for the entire world
its military professionals would then lay the foundation for a army eventually transforming it into a world peace corps
instead of being the guardians of war the military would i f t he then be the guardians of peace a title deserving infinitely more it is necessary for an important country to show the way for others to follow and neighboring countries will not invade her just because she has abolished compulsory military service and is using her professional army in the service of the that she is trying to construct
on the contrary this would very quickly cause other countries to follow suit and pursue the same path taken by your country
once is united militarily creating a single currency can unite its economy
then the same process could be applied throughout the world adding as we have already told you in the first message a single world language that would become compulsory in every school on earth
if one country must show the way then is that country
it is by advocating a deterrent force that we accumulate the arms of our own destruction
with each country wishing to deter some other country and in practice never quite knowing which one an unfortunate action could then threaten to transform that deterrent force into a force of intervention which could be fatal to the whole world
it is through the past that humanity views the future
this is a mistake
we should instead be critical of the past and build the present for the future rather than build the present on the basis of the past
you must understand that barely thirty years ago people of countries that are now advanced were still primitive
you are only just emerging
there are millions of people on earth who are still primitive and incapable of seeing something in the sky as anything other than a divine manifestation
moreover you know that religions are still very strong in all the economically you must not people for their age but for their intelligence while seeing to it that old people have a pleasant life
our distant ancestors should not be respected and furthermore they should be seen as an example of poor limited primitive people who were t he e b unable to open themselves to the universe and who were capable of handing down only very few things of value from one generation to the next
neither god nor soul my guide went on to say the more primitive a society is the more religions will flourish within it
this fact is actually cultivated by visitors from other planets who have no other way of peacefully visiting worlds that have not yet overcome their aggressiveness
if you reach the stage where you become evolved visitors on primitive worlds you will be forced to use such a system which is in fact very amusing and involves passing yourselves off as gods in their eyes
in fact this is extremely easy since for primitive people if you come from the sky you can only be divine
of course you must lay it on a bit thick to be respected and pleasantly received which does no harm
we continue to make appearances on earth to see if this still works and to see the reactions of public authorities governments and the press
we often amuse ourselves quite a lot  as we have already explained to you in the first part of this message there is no god and obviously no soul
after death there is nothing unless science is used to create something
as you know it is possible to recreate a dead organism from one of the organisms cells which contains its physical and intellectual blueprint
we have noted that an organism loses a few grams at the moment of its death in fact this is merely the energy that all living things have available to them which is eliminated at that moment
as you know energy like matter has weight
you also know that we have discovered that there is organized intelligent life on the level of the infinitely small quite certainly as i f t he evolved as we are and comparable to what we are ourselves
we have been able to prove this
from there we have discovered that the stars and planets are the atoms of a gigantic being which itself certainly contemplates other stars with curiosity
it is also highly likely that the people living on the infinitely small levels of the infinitely large person and his fellow creatures have known periods when they believed in an immaterial you must fully understand that everything is in everything
at this moment in an atom of your arm millions of worlds are being born and others are dying believing or not believing in a god and a soul and when a millennium has gone by for you the gigantic being of whom the sun is an atom has only had the time to take one step
time is in fact inversely proportional to the mass or rather to the level of the form of life
but everything in the universe is alive and in harmony with the infinitely large and the infinitely small
the earth is alive like all the planets and for the small growth that is humanity it is difficult to notice this because of the time lag due to the enormous difference in mass which prevents you from perceiving its
nor could one of our red blood cells or better still one of the atoms that make up our body imagine that it forms with its peers a living being
finally whatever happens to each individual the universal balance remains constant
but if we want to be happy at our level we must live in harmony with the infinitely large the infinitely small and with our fellow human beings
no argument aiming to support the existence of any type of god or soul can be sustained when we glimpse however briefly at the infinite nature of the universe
no heaven could exist in any particular place because since the universe is infinite it can not have a center
besides as i have already explained there can not be any communication between an infinitely large entity and a universe of infinitely small entities because the difference in mass is too great thus creating a difference in the flow of equivalent time
t he e n either g n or finally if one can imagine an immortal soul escaping from the body after death an image that is very poetic but rather naive since it comes from the minds of one can not imagine where it would go given that the universe is infinite
the quantity of energy that flies off at the time of death in a random way losing all identity as it blends with all the energies suspended in the surrounding air
that identity is obviously engraved only in organized matter such as the cells of a living being that has just died
this matter is organized according to the blueprint which the genes of the male and the female determined at conception while creating the first cell
with regard to the origin of life on earth some people might say your explanation change a thing since you can not say what there was at the very beginning
this is a foolish comment which proves that the person who makes it has no awareness of infinity which exists in time as well as in space
there is neither a beginning nor an end to matter since nothing is lost nothing is created everything is transformed as you have already heard it said
only the form of matter can change according to the wishes of those who have reached a scientific level which allows them to accomplish this
it is the same for the infinite levels of life
that is what the second part of our represents
the star of which is composed of two intertwined triangles means as above so below
with the swastika which signifies that everything is in the middle of a star you have our which contains all the wisdom in the world
you can also find the two symbols together in ancient writings like the or book of the dead and in many other writings as well
it is evidently very difficult for a finite human brain to be conscious of infinity which explains the need to limit the universe in time and space by belief in one or several gods that are made responsible for everything
indeed those who can not reach a sufficient level of human understanding towards the universe have trouble accepting the i f t he notion of infinity which makes humanity nothing exceptional but merely people situated at a particular time and place in the infinite people obviously prefer things to be well defined well framed limited in a way in the image of their own minds
those who ask themselves if it is possible that there is life on other planets are the best example of those limited minds and we liked very much the comparison you made during one of your lectures such people to frogs at the bottom of their own pond wondering whether there was life in other ponds
paradise on earth you could very soon live in a genuine terrestrial paradise if only the technology that you have at your disposal today were made to serve human wellbeing instead of serving violence armies or the personal profit of a few
science and technology can totally liberate humanity not only from the problem of hunger in the world but also from the obligation to work to live since machines can quite easily look after the daily chores by themselves thanks to automation
already in some of your most modern factories where it used to take several hundred people to build one car now only a single individual is needed to a computer that commands and carries out all the car building operations
in the future even that one person will be unnecessary
workers unions are not happy about this because factories are in less and less need of personnel and are letting more and more workers go
this is not normal these fantastic machines which do the work of people should enable those to really live rather than enrich only one person their boss
no individual should be in the service of another nor work for anyone for a salary
machines can easily do all the chores and take t he e paradise o n e care of all the work enabling people to themselves to the one thing for which they were created to think create and blossom
that is what happens on our planet
your children must no longer be raised according to the three primitive precepts of work family and country
on the contrary they should be brought up following the principles of fulfillment freedom and universal fraternity
work is not sacred when it is motivated only by the need to earn just enough to live a laborious life of hardship
it is even terribly degrading to sell oneself and ones life in order to eat by doing jobs that simple machines could do
the family has never been anything but a way for ancient as well as modern supporters of slavery to force people to work harder for an illusory family ideal
finally patriotism is still only a supplementary means of creating competition between people and urging them to perform their sacrosanct work with greater ardor each day
what is more those three concepts work family and country have always been supported by primitive religions
but now you are no longer primitive people
shake off all those dusty old principles and make the most of your life on earth which science can transform into paradise
do not be taken in by those who speak to you of potential enemies and allow armament factories to compel underpaid workers to produce destructive weapons that bring profits to big industrialists
do not be taken in by those who speak to you in horror of the falling because young people understand that they need not have so many children and that it is better to have fewer so they can be happier as they wont be too numerous on earth
do not be taken in by those who constantly remarks under your nose saying things like neighboring peoples are multiplying and could become a threat
they are the same people who support the stockpiling of nuclear weapons under the pretext of deterrence
i f t he finally do not let yourself be taken in by those who tell you that military service enables you to learn how to use a gun and that it can always be useful while they continue to pile up nuclear missiles
they want to teach you violence to teach you not to be afraid of killing a person like yourself using the excuse that he is wearing a different uniform and training you until it becomes a mechanical reflex after repeated practice against training targets
do not be taken in by those who tell you that you must fight for your country
no country deserves it
do not be influenced by those who say to you what if enemies invade our country we defend ourselves answer that is always more efficient than violence
it is not proven that those who died for were right no matter how hostile their were
look at the triumph of in
such people will tell you that you must fight for your liberty but they forget that the lost their war against the and that the are no worse off for being descendants of the conquered having benefited from the civilization of the conquerors
live rather in fulfillment freedom and love instead of listening to all those aggressive people
the most important aid you have to help you reach a long and lasting universal peace is television the source of a genuine planetary awareness that makes it possible to see what goes on every day all over the globe and realize that the barbarians who live on the other side of the border have all the same joys the same sorrows and the same problems as yourselves
it also records the progress of science the latest artistic creations and so on
of course it is important to ensure that this wonderful tool of diffusion and communication does not fall into the hands of people who would use it to condition masses of people by providing information
but you really can consider television to be the nervous system of humanity which enables each individual to be aware of the existence of others and to see how they live
it also prevents the spread of t he e paradise o n e distorted ideas about others that create a fear of strangers
long ago there was fear of the neighboring tribe then fear of the neighboring village of the neighboring province and of the neighboring state
there is currently a fear of the neighboring race and if this no longer existed there would be fear of potential coming from another planet
it is necessary to reverse this attitude and be open to everything that comes from the outside because all fear of strangers is proof of a primitive level of civilization
in this sense television is and is possibly the most important development of any civilization because in the same way as radio it enables all those isolated cells of humanity which people are to be informed at all times of what the others are doing
as already indicated it works exactly as the nervous system does in the body of a living being
the other world you are probably wondering where you are my guide said
in fact you are now on a base located relatively close to the earth
in the first message you noted that we traveled seven times faster than the speed of light
that was true years ago when we landed on earth
since then we have made much progress and we now travel through space much faster
it only takes us a few moments to make the journey that used to take us almost two months in those times and we continue to progress
if you will now follow me we will take a little trip together
i rose and followed my three guides
we went through an airlock and in a vast room i noticed a craft similar to the one that had brought me from earth but it was far larger
the exterior must have been about twelve meters in diameter and inside it had four seats facing each other instead of just two
we sat down as before and again i felt the same sensation of intense cold but it lasted much i f t he longer this time about ten minutes
then the craft rocked slightly and we stepped out through the trap door exit
before me a landscape unfolded and in fact i can not find any words to describe my enchantment at seeing huge flowers each more beautiful than the last and animals of unimaginable appearance were walking among them
there were birds with multicolored and pink and blue with the heads of bear climbing in the branches of trees that bore both enormous fruits and gigantic flowers
about thirty meters from the spacecraft a small group of was waiting for us and behind the trees i was able to make out a group of buildings that resembled brightly colored shells perfectly with the vegetation
the temperature was very mild and the air was perfumed with countless of exotic flowers
we walked towards the top of a hill and a marvelous panorama began to appear
innumerable small streams wound through the lush vegetation and far off an sea sparkled in the sun
reaching a clearing i discovered with great astonishment a group of people similar to me by which i mean people resembling those who live on earth not
most of them were naked or wore robes made of multicolored
they bowed respectfully before my three guides and then we all sat down
our armchairs seemed to have been carved in the rock and were covered with thick furs that always remained fresh and comfortable despite the warmth
some people came out of a small cave located right next to us and approached us carrying trays piled high with fruits grilled meats accompanied by the most incredible sauces and drinks of unforgettable flavors
behind each guest two of the men who carried the trays were kneeling ready to satisfy the slightest wish of those who were eating
the latter would ask them for whatever they desired without even looking at them
during the meal some marvelous music had started up from where i could not tell and young naked women with figures as t he e t he other w sculptural as those of the waiters started to dance with incomparable grace on the surrounding lawn
there must have been some forty guests who were similar to people from earth in addition to my three guides
there were white yellow and black men and women who all spoke a language i could not understand that resembled
i was sitting to the right of the whom i had met two years earlier and to the left of the six other
facing me sat a young bearded man very handsome and very slim
he wore a mysterious smile and an expression filled with feeling
to his right was a man with a noble face sporting a black beard that was very thick and very long
to his left was a more man with an face
he had a shaven head
meeting the ancient prophets towards the end of the meal my guide started to speak to me in my first message i told you of a residence located on our planet where people from earth can continue to live thanks to the scientific secret of eternity that is based on a single cell
among those people are and so on
this residence is in fact very large since it is an entire planet where the members of the council of the live as well
my name is and i am the president of that council of the
there are currently people from earth living on the planet where we are at this moment
they are people who during their lives reached a sufficient level of towards the infinite or who enabled humanity on earth to progress from its primitive level through their discoveries their writings their ways of organizing society and their acts of fraternity love or selflessness
alongside them live the members of the council of the i f t he whatever the outcome of your mission may be you have your place reserved here among us in this veritable little paradise where everything is easy thanks to science and where we live happily and
i can truly say for as on earth we created all life here and we are starting to understand perfectly the life of the infinitely large that is to say of the planets and we can detect signs of old age in solar systems which will enable us to leave this planet in time to create another paradise elsewhere as soon as we grow anxious about its survival
the who live here both people from earth and can fulfill themselves as they wish without having to do anything but that which pleases them scientific research meditation music painting and so on
or they can do nothing at all if they feel like it
the servants you saw carrying the dishes a little while ago as well as the dancers are just biological robots
they are created according to the same principle we used to create the people of earth in a totally scientific way but they have been limited and are absolutely submissive to us
they are also incapable of acting without orders from us and they are very specialized
they have no aspirations of their own and no pleasure except those that are necessary for their specialization
they grow old and die like us but the machine that makes them can make far more than we need
they are incapable of feelings or suffering and can not reproduce themselves
their life span is similar to ours that is to say about years with the help of a small surgical intervention
when one of them must be destroyed due to old age the machine that created them produces one or several others depending on our needs
they come out of the machine ready to function and with their normal height for they have neither growth nor childhood
they only know how to do one thing obey people from earth and and they are incapable of the slightest violence
they can all be recognized by the small blue stone that both males and females wear between their eyes
they take care of the dirty jobs t he e a p and do all the work that is uninteresting
they are produced taken care of and destroyed underground where in fact all the maintenance work is done by such robots and by enormous computers that regulate all the problems of nourishment supply of raw materials energy and other things
we each have on average ten robots at our service and as there are slightly more than of us earth people and there is a permanent total of male and female robots
like the members of the council of the the from earth are not allowed to have children
they agree to have a small operation which makes them sterile but that sterility can easily be reversed
the purpose of this measure is to prevent beings from joining us in this marvelous world
however male and female can unite freely just as they wish and all jealousy is eliminated
in addition men who wish to have one or more companions outside the relationships of equality that exist between eternal men and women or who do not want to live with a woman on an equal basis may have one or more totally submissive biological robot women with the exact appearance that is desired
the same goes for women who can have one or several totally submissive biological the machine that generates the robots gives the entity that it creates the exact physical appearance and specialization desired
there are several types of ideal women and men in terms of shape and physiognomy but the height measurements shape of the face and so on can be modified as one wishes
one can even submit the picture of someone particularly admired or loved on earth for example and the machine will produce an exact replica
thus the relationships between of both sexes are much more and respectful and the unions between them are marvelously pure because of the extraordinary level of of those admitted here there is never any problem between them
the majority spends almost all of their time meditating doing scientific i f t he research making inventions and artistic compositions and creating all sorts of things
we can live in different cities with multiple architectural styles in greatly varied sites that we can modify at will
people fulfill themselves as they wish only doing what they like to do
some find pleasure in doing scientific experiments others in playing music others in creating ever more amazing animals and others in meditating or doing nothing other than making love while enjoying the numerous pleasures of this heavenly environment drinking from the innumerable fountains and eating the juicy fruits that grow all over the place at all times
here there is no winter we all live in a region comparable to your equator but as we can scientifically control the climate it is always fine weather and not too hot
we make the rain fall during the night when and where we wish
all this and many other things which you could not understand all at once makes this world a true paradise
here everyone is free and can be so in total safety for all deserve that liberty
all things that bring pleasure are positive as long as that pleasure is not harmful to anyone in any way
this is why all sensual pleasures are positive for sensuality is always an opening up to the outside world and all such opening is good
on earth you are only just emerging from all those primitive taboos that tried to make anything to do with sex or nudity appear evil whereas nothing could possibly nothing is more disappointing for your creators than to hear people say that nudity is something bad nudity the image of what we have made
as you can see almost everyone is naked here and those dressed in clothes wear them either because they are works of art given to them by other who made them with their own hands or for elegance and decoration
when people from earth are admitted to this world of the they start out by receiving some chemical education so that nothing surprises them and they have a good understanding of where they are and why
my guide paused for a moment and then said you are now sitting directly opposite the man who years ago was t he e a p given the responsibility of creating a movement to spread more widely the message we had left originally to the people of a message which would enable you to be understood now
i am referring to whom we were able to recreate from a cell that we had preserved before his crucifixion
the handsome bearded young man seated opposite offered me a smile full of fraternity
to his right is on his left and to the left of sits the one remembered on earth by the name of
a little further on you can see in whose writings i am called because out of respect they did not dare call me by name
the forty men and women present at this meal are all representatives of the religions created after our contacts on earth
all those present looked at me with expressions that were very friendly and amused probably because they were remembering their own surprise upon arriving in this world
my guide continued now i will show you some of our installations
he stood up and i followed him
he invited me to put on a very wide belt bearing a huge buckle
he and his two friends had buckled on the same kind of
immediately i felt myself being lifted up from the ground and carried at about twenty meters above the grass almost level with the tops of the trees at a very great speed maybe a hundred kilometers per hour maybe more towards a precise location
my three companions were with me in front and his two friends behind
one curious thing among others was that i did not feel any wind at all whipping against my face
we landed in a small clearing quite close to the entrance of a small cave
we were in fact still being carried by our belts but only at a height of one meter above the ground and moving more slowly
we passed through galleries with metallic walls and arrived in a vast hall in the center of which was an enormous machine surrounded by about ten robots recognizable by the ornaments on their foreheads
there we landed on the ground again and took off our belts
then spoke here is the machine that makes biological robots
we are going to create one of them for you
i f t he he made a sign to one of the robots located near the machine and the robot touched certain parts of it
then he made a sign for me to move close to a window measuring about two meters by one meter
in a bluish liquid i then saw the form of a human skeleton vaguely taking shape
its form grew clearer and clearer finally becoming a real skeleton
then some nerves took shape and formed over the bones then some muscles and finally some skin and hair
a splendid athlete was now lying there in a position where moments earlier there had been nothing
spoke again remember in the old testament this description in chapter son of man can these bones was a noise and behold a shaking and the bones came together bone to his bone
and when i beheld lo the sinews and the flesh came up upon them and the skin covered them above  and the breath came into them and they lived and stood up upon their feet an exceeding great army
the description that you will give of this will certainly be similar to apart from the noise which we have been able to eliminate
indeed what i had seen corresponded perfectly to description
following this the prostrate figure had slid to the left and disappeared completely from my sight
then a trap door opened and i saw the creature whose rapid creation i had witnessed lying on a very white fabric
he was still but suddenly he opened his eyes got up came down the few steps that separated him from our level and after exchanging a few words with another robot came up to me
he gave me his hand which i shook and i felt his skin soft and warm
do you have a picture of a loved one with you asked
yes i answered i have a picture of my mother in my wallet which i left in my clothes
t he e a p he showed it to me asking if it was the right one
when i agreed that it was he gave it to one of the robots who inserted it in the machine and touched parts of it
through the window i witnessed yet another creation of a living being
then as the skin started to cover the flesh i realized what was happening they were making an exact replica of my mother from the picture i had provided
indeed a few moments later i was able to kiss my mother or rather the image of my mother as she had been ten years before for the picture i had provided had been taken about ten years previously
then said to me now allow us to make a very small in your forehead
one of the robots came towards me and with the help of a small device similar to a syringe pricked my forehead so lightly that i hardly felt it
then he inserted the syringe in the enormous machine and touched other parts of it
again an entity was formed before my eyes
as the skin covered the flesh i saw another me take shape little by little
indeed the being that emerged from the machine was an exact replica of myself
as you can see told me this other you is not wearing the small stone on his forehead which is characteristic of the robots and that the replica of your mother also had
from a photo we can only make a replica of the physical body with no psychological personality or almost none whereas from a sample cell like the one we took from between your eyes we can create a total replication of the individual whose cell we took complete with the memory personality and character
we could now send the other you back to earth and people would not notice a thing
but we are going to destroy this replica immediately for it is of no use to us
at this moment there are two of you who are listening to me and the personalities of these two beings are beginning to be different because you know that you are going to live and he knows that he is going to be destroyed
but that does not bother him since he knows he is nothing but yourself
this is more proof if proof is needed of the non i f t he existence of the soul or a purely spiritual entity unique to each body in which certain primitive people believe
after that we left the room that housed that enormous machine and through a corridor we entered another room containing other we approached another machine
in this machine are kept the cells of malevolent people who will be recreated to be judged when the time comes
they are cells from those on earth who preached violence wickedness aggressiveness and
despite having in their possession all the elements to understand where they came from these people did not have the sense to recognize the truth
they will be recreated to undergo the punishment they deserve after being judged by those whom they made to suffer or by their ancestors or descendants
you now fully deserve a rest
this robot will be your guide and will provide you with anything you desire until tomorrow morning
we will then have a few more words to say to you and afterwards we will accompany you back to earth
between now and then you will have a of what awaits you when your mission is completed on your planet
the next moment a robot approached and saluted me respectfully
he was tall athletic looking dark beardless and very handsome
a of paradise the robot asked me if i wanted to see my room and after i agreed he handed me one of the belts used for travelling
i found myself being transported above the ground again and when i landed once more i found myself in front of a house that looked more like a shell than a residence
the interior was entirely carpeted with shaggy furs and there was a huge bed at least as big as four earth beds looking as if it had been sunk into the ground
it was t he e a f o f paradise recognizable only by the different colored furs covering it
in one corner of the huge room there was a massive sunken bathtub as big as a swimming pool surrounded by vegetation of marvelous shapes and colors
would you like some female companions asked the robot
come you can make your own choice
i put my belt on again and found myself transported back in front of the machine used for making robots
a luminous cube appeared in front of me
i was shown to an armchair facing the cube and given a helmet
when i had settled down a magnificent young with marvelously harmonious proportions appeared within the luminous cube
she moved in such a way as to show herself off and had she not been in a cube floating one meter above the ground i would have thought she was real
my robot asked me whether she pleased me and if i wished to have her shape altered or her face modified
i told him that i considered her perfect
he replied that speaking she was the ideal woman or rather one of the three types of ideal women as defined by the computer according to the taste of the majority of residents on the planet
but i could ask for any modification that i desired
at my refusal to change anything whatsoever about that magnificent creature a second woman this time blonde and alluring appeared in the luminous cube
she was different but just as perfect as the first one
with her i could not find anything to alter either
finally a third young female this one a redhead more sensual than the first two appeared in the strange cube
the robot asked me if i cared to see other models or if these three ideal types of my race would be enough for me
i answered quite naturally that i thought these three people were extraordinary
at that moment a magnificent black woman appeared in the cube then a very fine slender female and then finally another voluptuous young woman
i f t he the robot asked me which person i desired to have as a companion
since i answered that they all pleased me he went towards the robot making machine and spoke for a moment with one of his peers
then the machine was set in motion and i understood what was about to happen
a few minutes later i was back at my residence with my six companions
there i had the most unforgettable bath that i have ever had in the company of those charming robots totally submissive to all my desires
afterwards my robot guide asked if i wished to make some music
when i said yes he took out a helmet similar to the one i had put on before the projection of the female robot models
now he said imagine some music that you would like to hear
immediately a sound was heard corresponding exactly to music that i had been thinking about and as i constructed a melody in my head that same melody became a reality with sounds of an amplitude and a sensitivity that were more extraordinary than any i had ever heard
the dream of every composer had become a reality the ability to compose music directly without having to go through the laborious process of writing and
then my six adorable companions began dancing to my music in a most voluptuous and bewitching way
after a while my robot asked me if i would also care to compose some images
another helmet was given to me and i sat in front of a semicircular screen
i set myself to imagining certain scenes and these scenes at once became visible on the screen
i was seeing in fact an immediate visualization of all the thoughts that came to me
i started thinking about my grandmother and she appeared on the screen
i thought of a bouquet of flowers and it appeared and when i imagined a rose with green spots it appeared as well
this machine actually made it possible to visualize ones thoughts instantaneously without having to explain them
what a marvel with training one can create a story and have it played out my robot told me
many performances of this kind performances of direct creation are held here
t he e a f o f paradise finally after a while i went to bed and spent the most extravagant night of my life with my marvelous female companions
the next day i got up took another perfumed bath and then a robot served us a delicious breakfast
then he asked me to follow him for was expecting me
i put on the transportation belt again and soon found myself in front of a strange machine where the president of the council of the was waiting for me
it was not as large as the one that created robots but was still very big
a sizable armchair was embedded in its center
asked me if i had spent a pleasant night and then explained to me this machine will awaken certain faculties that lie dormant within you
your brain will then be able to exploit its full potential
sit down here
i sat down in the chair that he indicated and a sort of shell covered my skull
i thought i was losing consciousness for a moment and then it felt as if my head were about to explode
i saw multicolored flashes pass before my eyes
finally everything stopped and a robot helped me out of the armchair
i felt terribly i had the impression that everything was simple and easy
spoke again from now on we will see through your eyes hear through your ears and speak through your mouth
we will even be able to heal through your hands as we already do at and in many other places in the world for some sick people who deserve our help because of their will to radiate the message we have given you and because of their efforts to acquire a cosmic mind by opening themselves to infinity
we observe everyone
huge computers ensure a constant surveillance of all people living on earth
a mark is attributed to everyone depending on whether their actions during their life led towards love and truth or towards hate and
when the time comes to evaluate those who went in the right direction will have the right to eternity on this heavenly planet those who achieved nothing positive yet were not evil will not be recreated and for those whose actions were particularly negative a cell from i f t he their body will have been preserved which will allow us to recreate them when the time comes so that they can be judged and suffer the punishment they deserve
you who are reading this message understand clearly that you can have access to this marvelous world this paradise
you will be welcomed you who follow our messenger our ambassador on the path to universal love and cosmic harmony you who will help him realize what we will ask of him for we see through his eyes hear through his ears and speak through his mouth
your idea of creating a congregation of guides for humanity is very good
but be strict with regard to their selection so that our message will never be or betrayed
meditation is indispensable for opening ones mind but asceticism is useless
you must enjoy life with all the strength of your senses for the awakening of the senses goes together with the awakening of the continue to play sports if you wish and if you have the time for all sports and games are good whether they develop musculature or better still as do motor racing and racing
a person who feels alone can always try to communicate telepathically with us while trying to be in harmony with the infinite he or she will feel an immense sense of well being
what you have advised concerning a gathering of people who believe in us in each region on mornings at about eleven is very good
few members are presently doing this
mediums are useful so seek them out
but balance them because their gifts as mediums which are only gifts of telepathy unbalance them and they begin to believe in magic the supernatural and other incredibly stupid things including an ethereal body which is a new way of trying to believe in the soul which does not exist
in fact what they are actually doing is tuning into people who lived several centuries ago and whom we have recreated on this there is an important revelation which you may now make
the are our direct descendants on earth
that is why a specific t he e a f o f paradise destiny is reserved for them
they are the descendants of the sons of and the daughters of men as mentioned in genesis
their original mistake was to have mated with their scientific creations
that is why they have suffered for such a long time
but for them the time of forgiveness has come and they will now be able to live peacefully in their recovered country unless they make another mistake in not recognizing you as our messenger
we wish our embassy on earth to be built in on a tract of land given to you by the government
if they refuse you may build it elsewhere and will undergo a new punishment for not having recognized our messenger
you must devote yourself entirely to your mission
do not worry you will be able to support your family
people who believe in you and therefore in us must help you
you are our messenger our ambassador our prophet and in any case you have your place reserved here among all the other prophets
you are the one who must gather together people of all religions
for the movement you have created the movement must be the religion of religions
i insist that it is indeed a religion although an atheistic religion as you have already understood
those who help you we shall not forget and those who cause you trouble we shall not forget either
do not be afraid and fear no one for whatever happens you have your place among us
as for those who lose confidence shake them up a little
two thousand years ago those who believed in our messenger were thrown into a lions den
today what do you risk the irony of fools the sneers of those who understood anything and prefer to keep to their primitive beliefs what is all that compared to a lions den what is all that compared with what awaits those who follow you truly it is easier than ever to follow ones in the who is among us has already said on the subject of prophets i f t he the moment for men to give account is drawing near and yet in their they are turning away from their creator
no new warning comes from their creator whom they ignore and laugh at
and their hearts are amused by it
those who do evil comfort themselves secretly by saying is not this man only a mortal as we are it is a jumble of dreams
he made it all up himself
he is a poet
but let him bring a miracle like those who were sent in time past
 already had to suffer the sarcasm of some and had to suffer it as well
when he was on the cross some said if thou be the son of come down from the cross
and yet as you have seen is in marvelous shape and will be for all eternity as is and all those who followed them and believed in them
on the other hand those who criticized them will be recreated in order to receive their punishment
the computers that monitor those people who have no knowledge of this message are linked to a system that at the time of death and from a distance automatically samples a cell from which they may be recreated if they deserve it
while waiting to build our embassy create a seminary for the guides of the movement near the area where you reside
it is there that you who are our prophet the guide of guides will be able to train those responsible for spreading our message all over the t he e t he n the new then said those who wish to follow you will apply the laws i am now about to give you you will appear at least once in your lifetime before the guide of guides so that he may transmit your cellular plan through manual contact or have it transmitted by an initiated guide to the computer that will take this into account at your assessment hour of judgment
you will think at least once a day of the your creators
you will try to radiate the message of the around you by every possible means
you will at least once a year give a donation to the guide of guides that is equal to at least one percent of your annual income in order to help him devote himself full time to his mission and travel around the world to spread this message
you will at least once a year invite the guide of your region into your home and you will gather at your place people who are interested in hearing him explain the message in all its dimensions
if the guide of guides should disappear the new guide of guides will be the one who has been designated by the former guide of guides
the guide of guides will be the guardian of the embassy of the on earth and will be able to live there with his family and with the people of his choice
i f t he you you are our ambassador on earth and the people who believe in you must provide you with the means to accomplish your mission
you are the last of the prophets before the judgement you are the prophet of the religion of religions the and the shepherd of shepherds
you are the one whose coming was announced in all the religions by the ancient prophets our representatives
you are the one who will bring back the shepherds flock before the water is spilled the one who will bring back to their creators those they have created
those who have ears may hear those who have eyes may see
all those who have their eyes open will see that you are the first prophet who can be understood only by scientifically evolved beings
all that you speak of is incomprehensible to primitive this is a sign that will be noticed by those whose eyes are open the sign of the revelation the apocalypse
to the people of the state of must give some territory located near to the guide of guides so that he may build there the residence the embassy of the
the time has come people of to build the new as it was foreseen
is the one who was
reread your writings and open your eyes
we wish to have our embassy among our descendants and the people of are the descendants of the children born of the unions between the sons of and the daughters of men
people of we removed you from the clutches of the and you did not show yourselves worthy of our confidence we entrusted you with a message destined for all humanity and you jealously kept it instead of spreading it abroad
t he e to t he p o f i you have suffered for a long time to pay for your errors but the time of forgiveness has come and as was foreseen we have said to the north give them up and to the south do not hold them back
i have gathered your sons and daughters from the ends of the earth as was written in and you have been able to find your country again
you will be able to live there in peace if you listen to the last of the prophets the one who was to you and if you help him to accomplish what we ask of him
this is your last chance otherwise another country will welcome the guide of guides and build our embassy on its territory and that country will be close to yours it will be protected and happiness shall prevail and the state of will be destroyed once more
you child of who has not yet returned to your ancestral lands wait before returning there to see if the government will agree to our embassy being built there
if they refuse do not return and you will be one of those who will be saved from the destruction and whose descendants will one day be able to find the promised land again when the time comes
people of recognize the one to you give him the territory to build our embassy and help him build it
otherwise as happened years ago it will be constructed elsewhere and if it is constructed elsewhere you will be dispersed once again
if years ago you had recognized that was indeed our messenger all the in the world would not be but
you would not have had problems and you would have remained our ambassadors
but instead this task was given to other people who took for their base
two thousand years ago you did not recognize our messenger and it was not but that shone
now you have a new chance for it to be once more
if you do not seize it another country will shelter our embassy and you will no longer have any right to the land we had chosen for you
there i have finished
you will be able to all this by yourself once you have returned to earth
now enjoy this paradise a i f t he while longer and we will take you back for you to complete your mission before returning to us for good
i remained there for several more hours enjoying the many pleasures of that world meandering amongst numerous fountains and enjoying the company of the great prophets whom i had met the day before during meditation sessions
then after a last meal taken with the same people as the day before i found myself once again in the large vessel which set me down at the observation station
from there i retraced my route of the day before and found myself with my clothes in the small craft which dropped me off where it had picked me up at
i looked at my watch it was midnight
i returned home where i immediately set to work to write down all that i had been told
everything was perfectly clear in my mind and i was surprised to find that i was writing it all at one stroke recalling without any hesitation the sentences i had heard
the words remained as if engraved in my mind just as i had been told they would at the beginning
when i finished the account of what had happened i began to feel very clearly that something had been released inside me
this had never happened before
i began writing again all the while observing closely what i was putting down as if i was simultaneously discovering it as a reader
i was writing but this time i did not feel like the author of what was appearing on the paper
the were starting to speak through my mouth or rather to write with my what was being written before my eyes dealt with all areas that a person is confronted with during his or her lifetime and the right way to react when faced with these problems
it was in fact a code of life a new way of behaving in the face of events of behaving like a man that is to say as an evolved being and therefore trying in every way to open ones mind to infinity and to place oneself in harmony with it
these great rules dictated by the our creators our fathers who are in heaven as our ancestors used to say without t he e to t he p o f i really understanding are all set forth here in the following pages in their entirety
introduction or thousands of years those opposed to enlightenment and reform have effectively imprisoned our minds in
these writings however are the keys we can use to set ourselves free
the door that seals the human mind is fastened by many locks all of which must be opened at the same time if one wants to be able to free it towards the infinite
if only one key is used the other locks will remain fastened and if they are not all kept open at the same time then while the second lock is being freed the first one will close again preventing the door from opening
human society is afraid of what it does not know and so it is afraid of what lies behind this door even if it is happiness gained through knowledge of the truth
therefore it applies pressure to prevent people from even partly opening this door because society itself prefers to remain in a state of misfortune and ignorance
this is yet another obstacle found on the threshold of the doorway through which the mind must pass to free itself
but as said it is not because no one sees the truth that it becomes an error
so if you attempt to open this door ignore the sarcasm of those who have not seen anything and of those who having seen pretend not to see because of their fear of the unknown
also if opening the door seems too difficult for you ask for help from a guide since guides have already opened the doors of their t he k i own minds and know the difficulties involved
they will not be able to open your door for you but they will be able to explain the different techniques that will enable you to succeed
besides they are living witnesses of the happiness that can be achieved by opening the door and they prove wrong those who are afraid of what lies behind in every situation we must always consider things in regard to four in relation to infinity in relation to the our parents and creators in relation to human society and finally in relation to the individual
the most important level is that relating to infinity for it is in relation to this level that all things must be judged but always with one constant factor love
this means taking others into account who must be given love because we must live in harmony with infinity and to do this we must live in harmony with others because they are a part of infinity as well
then we must take into account the advice given by our creators the and act in such a way that human society listens to the advice of those who created it
then we must take into account society which makes it possible for individuals to blossom on the path of truth
but although society must be taken into account it should not be followed on the contrary society must be helped to emerge from its primitive by regular questioning of all its habits and traditions even if these are supported by laws that are only there to try and our minds in shackles of
i f t he finally we must take into account the fulfillment of the individual
without this the mind does not reach its full potential and it is impossible to yourself with infinity and become a new man if you are not fulfilled
you must never impose any religion whatsoever on a child who is still but a unable to understand what is happening to itself
so you must neither nor children nor submit them to any action that they have not themselves accepted
you must wait for them to reach the age when they can understand and choose and if a religion appeals to them at that time then leave them free to adhere a birth should be a festive occasion for the created us in their image to be capable of reproducing ourselves
by creating a living being we preserve our own species and respect the work of our a birth should also be an act of love achieved in harmony as far as sounds colors and temperature are concerned so that the human being who is emerging into life develops the habit of being in you must immediately develop in children the habit of respecting the liberty of others and when they cry at night go to them discreetly but without their realizing that crying has brought them the comfort of being tended
on the contrary you must go to them and look after them when they make no sound and not go to them at least not with their being aware of it when they cry
that way they will get used to everything going better when they are in harmony with their surrounding
god helps those who help themselves
t he k b in fact parents must understand that as soon as a child is born it is first of all an individual and that no individual should be treated like a child
even our creators do not treat us like children but as individuals
that is why they do not intervene directly to help us solve our problems but allow us to overcome the obstacles that we encounter by working things out for ourselves as responsible individuals
the little creature who is still just the of a human being must in its infancy grow accustomed to respecting the liberty and the tranquillity of others
since little children are too young to understand and reason corporal punishment should be rigorously applied by the person bringing them up so that they suffer when they cause suffering or disturb others by showing a lack of respect
this corporal punishment should be applied only to very young children and then in keeping with the growing power to reason and understand it should be out progressively and eventually stopped altogether
from the age of seven corporal punishment should be quite exceptional and from the age of fourteen it should never be applied
you will use corporal punishment only when punishing a child for not respecting the freedom and tranquillity of others or yourself
you will teach your child to blossom and you will teach him or her always to have a questioning attitude towards those things which society and its schools want to
you will not force your child to learn things that are not useful and you will let him or her follow any desired path because do not forget the most important thing is his or her fulfillment
i f t he you will teach your child always to judge things in the right order with respect to infinity with respect to our creators with respect to society and with respect to itself
you will not impose any religion on your child but instead teach him or her the various beliefs that exist throughout the world or at least the most important ones in chronological order the religion the religion and the religion
you will try to learn the major trends of thought of the eastern religions if you can so that you are able to explain them to your child
finally you will explain to him or her the main points of the message given by the to the last of the prophets
above all you will teach your child to love the world in which it lives and through this world our creators
you will teach him or her to open up to infinity and try to live in harmony with infinity
you will teach your child about the marvelous work accomplished by the our creators and constantly seek ways for humanity to become capable of repeating some day what our creators have done namely creating other humanities elsewhere by scientific you will teach your child to consider itself a part of the infinite that is both immense and minute at the same time
from dust were ye made and dust ye shall become
you will teach your child that the wrong done to others can not be repaired by any confession or absolution once it is done and that it must not be thought that when death is near it is sufficient to begin to believe in the or any god in order to have the right to eternal life
you will teach your child that we are judged by what we do throughout our lives that the path which leads to wisdom is long and that it certainly takes a whole lifetime to master it sufficiently
a person who has not gone in the right direction throughout life will not gain the right to scientific resurrection on the planet of the just by making a sudden late change to the right path that is unless that persons regret is truly genuine and he or she acts with t he k e great sincerity making up for lost time striving to be forgiven by those who were harmed and devoting all his or her means to bringing them love and happiness
all this will still not be enough for the person who has made others suffer for even if he or she is forgiven by them and gives them love the errors will have been erased but nothing positive will have been accomplished
this person will then have to set out anew bring happiness to new people whom he or she has never harmed and help those who spread the truth the guides
but it is too late for someone who has regrets only at the moment of death or shortly before
this person will not be forgiven
sensual education sensual education is one of the most important things and yet at the moment it scarcely exists at all
you will awaken the mind of your child but you will also awaken his or her body for the awakening of the body is linked to the awakening of the mind
all those who seek to numb the body are also numbing the mind
our creators have given us our senses so that we use them
the nose is meant for smelling the eyes for seeing the ears for hearing the mouth for tasting and the fingers for touching
we must develop our senses so as to get more enjoyment from all the things around us which our creators put here for us to enjoy
a sensual individual is far more likely to be in harmony with infinity because such a person can feel it without having to meditate or reflect
meditation and reflection will enable that individual to understand this harmony better and to radiate it all around himself or herself by teaching it
i f t he to be sensual means to let your environment give you pleasure
sexual education is very important as well but it only teaches the technical functions and uses of the organs
sensual education on the other hand teaches us how to gain pleasure from our organs purely for pleasures sake without necessarily seeking to use them for their utilitarian purposes
to say nothing to your children about their sexual organs is wrong and although it is better to explain what they are for this is still not you must explain how they can gain pleasure from them
to explain only their function would be like telling them that music is for marching to that knowing how to write is helpful only for letters of complaint or that movies are useful only for giving audio visual courses and other such nonsense
fortunately thanks to artists and through the awakening of our senses we can obtain pleasure from listening reading or looking at works of art that were made for no other reason than to give pleasure
the same goes for the sexual organs
they are not just for satisfying our natural needs or for ensuring reproduction but also for giving pleasure to others and ourselves
thanks to science we have finally emerged from the days when showing ones body was a sin and when sexual intercourse brought its own punishment the conception of a child
now thanks to contraceptive techniques sexual union is freely possible without it becoming a definitive commitment or even a possible one
you will teach your child all this without shame but on the contrary with love clearly explaining that he or she was made to be happy and blossom fully that is to say to enjoy life with all the senses and with their full force
you must never be ashamed of your body or of your nakedness for nothing our creators more than to see those they created feeling ashamed of the appearance that has been given to them
you will teach your children to love their bodies and every part of the creation because in loving their creation we love them t he k e each one of our organs was created by our parents the so that we might use it feeling not shame but happiness at using something for which it was designed
if the act of using one of our organs brings pleasure it means that our creators wish us to have that every individual is a garden that should not be left
a life without pleasure is an garden
pleasure is the fertilizer that opens up the mind
asceticism is useless unless it is a temporary ordeal designed to train the mind to dominate the body
but once we have succeeded in the ordeal that we have set ourselves which must always be limited in time we should once more enjoy the pleasures of life
asceticism can be accepted as the fallow period of that garden which is an individual that is to say a momentary pause in the search for pleasure which enables us to appreciate it better later on
you will your children to having more and more freedom by always treating them as individuals
you will respect their tastes and inclinations as you would like them to respect your own
make sure you realize that your child male or female is what it is and that you will not be able to make it what you want just as it will not be able to make you what it wants you to be
respect your child so that it respects you and respect its tastes so that it respects yours
fulfillment should be sought according to ones tastes and aspirations without any preoccupation with what others think as long as no one else is being hurt
if you feel like doing something first see that it does no harm to anyone then do it without worrying about what others think of it
if you feel like having a sensual or sexual experience with one or several other individuals whatever sex they may be you may behave as you i f t he desire as long as they agree
everything is permitted on the path to fulfillment in order to awaken the body and hence the mind
we are at last emerging from those primitive times when women were seen merely as instruments of reproduction belonging to society
thanks to science women are now free to fulfill themselves without having to fear the punishment of pregnancy
at last woman is truly the equal of man since she may enjoy her body without living in fear of having to endure alone the consequences of her conceiving a child is something too important to be left to chance
therefore do so only by choice after mature consideration in a marvelous act of love being fully aware of what you are doing and being certain that you truly wish it because a child can not become a successful individual unless it is truly desired at the very moment of conception
the moment of conception is the most important because it is at that time that the first cell and therefore the plan of the individual is conceived
this moment must therefore be desired so that the first cell may be created in perfect harmony with the minds of the two parents thinking strongly and consciously of the human being that they are conceiving
this is one of the secrets of the new individual
if you are looking only for the fulfillment of your body and therefore of your mind use the means that science has put at your disposal starting with contraception
only conceive a child when you yourself are fulfilled so that the life you conceive may be the fruit of the union of two fulfilled individuals
to reach fulfillment use the means that science has provided to enable you to awaken your body to pleasure without any risks
pleasure and procreation are two different things that must not be confused
the first is for the individual and the second is for the species
it is only when the individual is fulfilled that he or she can create a fulfilled human being
if by accident you have conceived a child without desiring it use the means that science puts at your disposal abortion
a child who t he k f was not desired at the moment of conception can not blossom fully since it was not created in harmony
do not listen to those who try to frighten you by talking about the physical and especially moral consequences that an abortion can trigger
there are none if you are treated by competent people
its rather by keeping an child that you will be left with physical and moral disturbances that can be passed on and that will make the child you brought into the world suffer too
having a child does not necessarily imply that you must be married or even live with a man
already many women have decided to have one or more children without marrying or living with a man
the education of a child who is an individual right from birth should not necessarily be provided by the parents
it would indeed often be preferable for education to be entrusted to specialized people who would contribute far more than some parents towards their fulfillment
if you wish to have a child without living with a man do as you desire
fulfill yourself as you would like without worrying what others think
if you choose to do this do not think that you are condemned to live alone forever
welcome the men you like and they will serve as masculine role models for your child
you can even decide one day to live with a man this will not cause any problems for your child at all
on the contrary it will contribute to his or her fulfillment
a change of environment is always positive for a child
society should organize itself to take charge of the education of children partially or totally depending on the parents wishes
those parents who want to work should be able to leave their children in the custody of competent people and those who want their children to receive an education given entirely by such individuals should be able to entrust their children completely to establishments created for this purpose
in this way if you give birth to a child you desired but afterwards you separate from your companion or for any other reason you no longer desire the child you will be able to entrust your i f t he child to society so that it may be brought up surrounded by the harmony necessary for its fulfillment for a child who grows up in surroundings where it is not really and truly wanted can not blossom and be fulfilled
bringing up a child should be mutually fulfilling for both parent and offspring
if a child becomes a nuisance however slight it realizes this and fulfillment is affected
a child should therefore be kept near you only if its presence is felt to be fulfilling
otherwise the child should be put in establishments that society must create to encourage fulfillment and be placed there without the least regret
on the contrary parents should feel a profound sense of joy because they are entrusting their child to others more capable than themselves of helping each little individual to blossom
regular visits can even take place if the children whose wishes are of primary importance would like them
the people in charge of the education should always describe the parents as exceptional people who placed more importance on their fulfillment than on their own selfish pleasure of bringing them up themselves
they did this the children should be told by entrusting them to people more competent than themselves
choose your partner freely if you desire one
marriage whether religious or civil is useless
you can not sign a contract to unite living individuals who are bound to change because they are alive
reject marriage which is only the public proclamation of ownership of a person
a man or woman can not be the property of anyone else
any contract can only destroy the harmony existing between two individuals
when we feel loved we feel free to love but when we have signed a contract we feel like prisoners who are forced to love each other and sooner or later we begin to hate each other
so you will live with the person of your choice only for as long as you feel happy with him when you no longer get on well together do not remain together because your union will become hell
all living beings evolve and t he k f rightly so
if the personal evolution of each individual is similar the union lasts but if their progress is different then union is no longer possible
you no longer like the individual you used to like because one of you has changed
you must part from each other while retaining happy memories of your time together instead of spoiling it with useless bickering which gives way to hostility
a child chooses clothes that fit and when it them they must be changed for different clothes otherwise they will be torn to pieces
the same applies for unions you must leave each other before being torn to above all do not be worried about your child
it is better for him or her to be with only one parent in harmony than to be with both in discord or lacking perfect harmony
do not forget that children are above all individuals
society must make absolutely sure that old people have a happy life without any material worries
but although we must respect the elderly and do everything to make them happy we should not listen to them just because of their seniority
an intelligent person can give good advice at any age but a stupid person even if he is a hundred years old does not deserve to be listened to for a second
what is more such a person has no excuse having had an entire lifetime in which to try to awaken whereas there is still hope for a young and stupid person
but in any case a stupid old person must still be able to live comfortably
this is a duty for death should not be an occasion for sad gatherings on the contrary it should be a time of joyful celebration because it is the moment when the beloved one may perhaps reach the paradise of the in the company of our creators the
you will therefore ask not to be buried religiously but you will donate your body to science or you will ask that your body be disposed of as discreetly as possible except for the bone of your forehead more precisely the part located above the beginning of the nose
inches above the middle of the axis linking the pupils of your eyes
at least one square centimeter
square i f t he inches of this bone should be sent to the guide of guides so that he may keep it in our embassy on earth
each person is monitored by a computer that records all their actions and will make a tally of them at the end of their life
but people who know about this message which is communicating will be recreated from the cells that they have left in our embassy
in their cases recreation will take place only if they ensure that the required part of their body is sent to the guide of guides after their death
the mechanism within the computer that records the information to be used in judgement of individuals remains in operation after they learn about the message
but the mechanism that allows an automatic sampling of a cell at the moment of death is disconnected
so only those who comply exactly with what is required once they know about the message will be recreated
make sure that at least once in your life you see the guide of guides or a guide authorized by him to transmit your cellular plan to the so that they may awaken your mind and help you to remain awakened
in accordance with what is written earlier in this message you will not leave an inheritance to your children except for the family house or apartment
the rest you will leave in your will to the guide of guides and if you fear your descendants might not respect your last will and testament but might try to recover your property through the courts you will bestow it while you are alive on the guide of guides in order to help him spread the message of our creators on those of you who remain after the death of a loved one do not be sad and lament
try instead to give love to those you love while they are still living because once they are dead what makes you unhappy is the thought that perhaps you did not love them enough and that now it is too late
anyone who was good in their lifetime has the right to the gardens for eternity and will know happiness and anyone who was not good does not deserve to be missed
t he k f but even if an individual is not among those chosen for recreation he or she does not really vanish
death is not a very important thing and we should not be afraid of it
it is just like falling asleep except it is an endless sleep
since we are a part of infinity the matter of which we are made does not disappear
it continues to exist in the soil or in plants or even in animals clearly losing all homogeneity and therefore all identity
this part of infinity that was organized by our creators according to a very precise plan returns to the infinite while remaining a part of this small ball called earth which is alive
everyone has the right to live the right to love and the right to die
everyone is the director of his or her own life and death
death is nothing but suffering is terrible and everything must be done to eliminate it
someone who is suffering too much has the right to commit suicide
if this persons actions were positive during his or her life he or she will be admitted to the planet of the
if someone you love suffers very much and wishes to die but does not have the strength to commit suicide help them to take their own when science one day enables you to eliminate human suffering then you can ask yourselves whether it is right to commit suicide or society and government just as a human body has a brain to make decisions it is essential that society also have a government to make decisions
so you will do everything you can to set up a government that practices which puts intelligence in power
you will also participate in the creation of a worldwide political party advocating and as they are described in the first part of this message of the and you will i f t he support its candidates
only via can humanity move fully into the golden age
total democracy is not good
a body in which all the cells command can not survive
only intelligent people should be permitted to make decisions involving humanity
you will therefore refuse to vote unless a candidate advocating and is standing for election
neither universal suffrage nor public opinion polls are valid ways of governing the world
to govern is to foresee not to follow the reactions of a population among whom only a very small number are sufficiently awakened to guide humanity
since there are very few awakened people if we base decisions on universal suffrage or opinion polls the decisions become the choice of the majority and therefore of those who are not awakened
such people respond in the interests of their immediate gratification or as a result of instinctive reactions that are unconsciously confined in a of conditioning
only which is a selective democracy is worthwhile
as was stated in the first part of this message of the only people whose net level of intelligence is fifty per cent above average should be eligible to stand for election and only those whose net level of intelligence is ten per cent above the average should be eligible to vote
scientists are already developing techniques to measure net intelligence
follow their advice and act in such a way that the most precious minerals of humanity exceptionally gifted children may receive an education at a level appropriate to their genius since normal education is designed only for normal children of average intelligence
it is not the number of that one has obtained that signifies intelligence since this only calls upon the rather uninteresting faculty of memory which machines can replace
intelligence in its raw state is the quality that can make peasants or workers much more intelligent than engineers or professors
this can be spoken of as common sense as well as creative genius because most inventions are nothing more than a matter of common sense
t he k g as already stated to govern is to foresee and all the great problems that humanity is now facing prove that past governments did not have foresight and were therefore incompetent governments
the problem does not lie with the people who govern but rather the technique that is used to choose them the problem is the way we select those who govern us
basic democracy must be replaced by a selective democracy that is which puts intelligent people in power
this is a very fundamental requirement
human laws are indispensable and you will respect them while seeing to it that those that are unfair or obsolete are changed
between human laws and those of our creators you will not hesitate one instant as even the human judges will be judged some day by our the police will be essential for as long as it takes society to discover the medical means to eradicate violence and prevent criminals or those who the freedom of others from acting out their antisocial impulses
unlike soldiers who are the of war police officers are the of peace and they will remain indispensable until science has solved this problem
in countries where compulsory military service exists you will refuse to participate
instead ask to be granted the status of a conscientious objector which will allow you to serve in a division that does not carry weapons as is your right if your religious or philosophical convictions forbid you to kill your fellow human beings
this is the case for those who believe in the our creators and want to follow the directives of the guide of guides of the movement
contrary to what many young people think conscientious objectors are not sent to jail but serve instead in some civilian role or in an unarmed division for a period that is double the normal duration of military service
it is better to spend two years working in an office than to be trained for one year in techniques that enable you to kill fellow human beings
i f t he military service must be eliminated urgently in all the countries of the world
all professional soldiers must be transformed into guardians of world peace who work in the service of freedom and human rights
the only system of government that is worthwhile is applying
capitalism is wrong because it people to money a few on the backs of others
communism is also wrong since it places greater importance on equality than on liberty
there must be equality among people at the beginning at birth but not afterwards
although everyone has the right to have sufficient means to live decently those who do more for their fellow human beings have the right to receive more than those who do nothing for the community
this is obviously a temporary rule until human beings can have robots to perform all menial labor so that they can devote themselves exclusively to their fulfillment after having totally abolished money
in the meantime it is shameful that while some people are dying of hunger others throw food away to prevent prices collapsing
instead of throwing away this food they should distribute it to those who have nothing to eat
work must not be considered sacred
everyone has the right to live comfortably even if they do not work and should try to fulfill themselves and blossom in whatever field attracts them
if people are organized it will not take them long to and automate all indispensable work
then everybody will be able to blossom freely
if all individuals really set their minds to it in only a few years freedom from the need to work could be attained
what is required is a marvelous burst of enthusiasm and solidarity in working for the liberation of from material
all technical and scientific resources should be pooled and all those working in these areas should truly set their minds on striving together for the well being of the entire community rather than for vested interests
use all the resources which are currently wasted on military budgets or the inane development of nuclear weapons or even flights into space
such things could be better t he k g planned and much more easily accomplished once humanity is free of material
you have computers and electronic equipment that can better replace manpower
put them all to work so that this technology can truly operate in the service of
in a few years you can build a completely different world
you have reached the golden age
do everything possible to create the biological robot that will release you from all menial labor and enable you to blossom and fulfill yourselves
urban development must be reconsidered as it is described in the book which tells the truth
you must build very tall communal houses situated in open country so that individual houses do not devour nature
never forget that if everyone had a country house with a small garden there would be no more countryside
these communal houses must be cities that are equipped with everything people need and be capable of accommodating about inhabitants each
until the day you become creators and can recreate it yourselves you must respect nature
by respecting nature you respect those who created it our parents the
you will never make animals suffer
you may kill them to feed on their flesh but do this without making them suffer
although as already indicated death is nothing suffering is an and you must avoid making animals suffer as you must prevent human beings from suffering
nevertheless do not eat too much meat and you will feel better you may live on all that the land provides
you do not have to follow a special diet you may eat meat vegetables fruits and other plants
but it is foolish to follow a vegetarian diet under the pretext that you do not want to live on the meat of other living creatures
plants are alive just as you are and suffer in the same way that you you must not cause suffering to plants that are alive just as you are
i f t he do not yourself with alcoholic beverages
you may drink a little wine while eating for it is a product of the earth
but never yourself
you may drink alcoholic beverages in exceptional circumstances but in very small quantities and accompanied by solid food so that you never get drunk
anyone who is drunk is no longer capable of being in harmony with infinity nor able to control himself
this is something appalling in the eyes of our creators
you will not smoke for the human body was not made to smoke
this has appalling effects on the organism and prevents total fulfillment and harmonization with infinity
you will not use drugs
you will not drug yourself in any way for the awakened mind needs nothing outside itself to approach infinity
it is an in the eyes of our creators that people think they must take drugs to improve themselves
human beings have no need to improve themselves because all are perfect having been made in the image of our creators
to say that a human being is imperfect is to insult our creators who made us in their image
but although we are perfect we cease to be so if we think of ourselves as imperfect and remain resigned to such to remain perfect as the created us we need to make an effort at every moment of the day to keep ourselves in an awakened meditation and prayer you should meditate at least once each day locating yourself in relation to infinity in relation to the to society and yourself
you should meditate upon awakening so that your whole being becomes fully conscious of infinity and you are placed in full possession of all your faculties
t he k you should meditate before each meal so that all parts of your body eat when you eat and when you yourself think of what you are doing
your meditation will not be a dry meditation but on the contrary a sensual meditation
you will let yourself be engulfed by peace and harmony until it becomes a delight
your meditation should not be forced labor but a pleasure
it is better not to meditate at all than to meditate without really wanting to do so
do not impose meditation on your children or your family
but explain to them the pleasure that it gives and the sense of wellbeing that it brings and if they then feel like meditating try to teach them what you know
think intensely of the our creators at least once a day and try to communicate with them telepathically
in this way you will rediscover the original meaning of prayer
if you do not know how to go about it you can take your inspiration from the lords prayer the words of which are perfectly appropriate for communication with our at least once a week attempt group communication with the alongside other people from your region who believe in them
if possible you should be accompanied by a guide
do your very best every year to attend the meeting of all those who believe in the and in the message they have given to the last of the prophets
technique for attempting contact with the here is a model of what you could say while looking towards the sky and thinking intensely about the words you are there somewhere near those stars
you are there and i know you are watching us
i f t he you are there and i would so much like to meet you
you are there and what am i to hope to deserve a i recognize you as our creators and i place myself humbly at your service
i recognize your messenger as my guide and i believe in him and in the message you gave him
i will do my best to make the message known to those around me because i know i have not done enough
i love all human beings as my brothers and sisters because they are made in your image
i am trying to bring them happiness by opening their minds to infinity and revealing to them what was revealed to me
i am trying to stop their suffering by placing my whole being at the service of of which i am a part
i am trying to use to the utmost the mind you have given me to help emerge from darkness and suffering
i hope that you will judge the little i have done by the end of my life to be sufficient to grant me the right to eternal life on the planet of the wise
i love you as you must have loved human beings to admit the best of them among your
t he k t he a do as much as possible to encourage artists and to help your child if he or she is attracted by the arts
art is one of the things which best enables you to with infinity
consider every natural thing an art and every art a natural thing
surround yourself with artistic things whether they appeal to your ears your eyes your sense of touch smell or taste
everything which appeals to the senses is artistic
there is more than just music painting sculpture and all the officially recognized gastronomy is also an art as well as perfume making since they both appeal to the senses
standing above all finally love is an art
all art makes use of harmony and therefore allows those who appreciate it to be taken over by something harmonious
this consequently produces the right conditions for placing oneself in harmony with infinity
literature is particularly important because it contributes to opening peoples minds by showing them new horizons
but literature for literatures sake is just what counts is not writing beautiful sentences but the transmission of new ideas to others through reading
means are even more important for they appeal to our senses of sight and hearing at the same time
they could well replace literature since they are more complete
meanwhile literature is useful for the time being
sensual meditation if you want to reach a high level of harmony with infinity arrange a place of sensual meditation for yourself
place in it works of art paintings reproductions tapestries posters sculptures drawings i f t he photographs or anything else that is intended to represent love infinity and sensuality for the enjoyment of your eyes
arrange for yourself a corner where you can sit close to the ground on cushions for example
or lie down on a couch or on fur for the pleasure of touching it
evaporate agreeable and oils to please your nose
have a tape recorder and a on which you have recorded music that you like for the pleasure of your ears
have trays and bottles filled with food and drink that you like for the pleasure of your mouth and invite one or several people you love who share your tastes and with whom you feel at ease and in harmony then feed your senses together and open your bodies in order to open your minds in love and fraternity
if someone appeals to you physically and you feel that it is reciprocal invite him or her to this place
together you can reach a sublime state of harmony which will enable you to approach infinity by satisfying your five senses
to this state will be added the synthesis of all these pleasures the physical union of two individuals in total harmony and in the illumination of the act of love
obviously the harmony must first exist spiritually
in other words there must be a mutual attraction between the minds and thus the bodies of the individuals in the way they approach and respect each other
but a spiritual love is always made sublime by a fulfilled physical love
to love is to give and expect nothing in exchange
if you love somebody you should give yourself to this person entirely if he or she desires it
never be jealous for jealousy is the opposite emotion to love
when you love someone you must seek his or her happiness first and foremost and in every way
to love is to seek the happiness of others and not your own
if the person you love is attracted to another do not be jealous on the contrary be happy that the one you love is happy even if it is because of somebody else
love also the person who like you wants to bring happiness to the person you love and who therefore has the same goal as you
jealousy is the fear that someone else may make the person you love happier t he k than you do yourself and that you may lose the one you love
but instead of feeling jealous we should try to do as much as possible to make the person we love happy and if somebody else succeeds better in this we should be happy about it
what counts is not that our beloved be happy because of us but simply that they be happy whoever is responsible
so if the person you love is happy with somebody else rejoice in this happiness
you will recognize the person who loves you in that he or she will not oppose your happiness with someone else
it is your duty to love the person who loves you that much and to give him or her happiness yourself
in that direction lies the path of universal love
do not reject someone who wants to make you happy for by accepting that he does so you make him happy and this is an act of love
rejoice in the happiness of others so that they may rejoice in human justice between human laws and those of our creators you will not hesitate one instant as even the human judges will be judged some day by our human laws as already stated are essential
but they must be improved upon because they do not take love and fraternity sufficiently into consideration
the death penalty must be abolished because no individual has the right to kill another coldly in a organized manner
until the time comes when through science society is able to control the violence that occurs in some people and can cure them of their illness you will keep criminals apart from society
then give them the love that they have lacked while trying to make them understand the i f t he monstrous nature of their actions
give them also the desire to redeem themselves
do not mix hardened criminals who are suffering from an illness that can be contagious with people who have merely committed petty offenses
that way you will avoid contaminating the lesser never forget that all criminals are sick and always consider them as such
we are shocked when we remember that once upon a time we used to people between mattresses if they suffered from fits of hysteria
some day when we are able to cure and more importantly prevent the sickness of crime we will be just as shocked when we look back at how we used to execute criminals
forgive those who have done you harm unintentionally and bear no grudge against those who have willingly done you harm
they are ill for one must be ill to harm ones neighbor
besides think how unfortunate those people are who do harm others because they will not have the right to eternal life in the gardens of the
but if someone wants to harm you or those you love try to subdue them
if you can not then you have the right to defend yourself to save your own life or the lives of your loved ones
however never strike with the intention to kill even in legitimate defense
try only to render the person harmless by knocking him or her out for example
if the blow you give turns out to be fatal you have nothing to blame yourself for as long as you did not have the intention to kill
you will subdue violent people by and if necessary by direct action
violent behavior is intolerable and you will not tolerate it even if you have to forcibly restrain violent people
but always use a nonviolent force that is to say a balanced force applied without malicious intent sufficient only to overcome those who try to do harm
any threat of violence should be treated as seriously as an actual violent deed
to threaten violence is to think it possible and to see it as an acceptable way of achieving ones goals
a person capable of threatening another with violence is as dangerous as someone who has already committed a violent act
until we can find a medical cure t he k h for those who make such threats they must be kept outside society and we must try to make them understand that their behavior is when dealing with those who take hostages think first of the lives of innocent people who are in the hands of the
people who take hostages are sick and you should not give them what they demand
society in fact must never give in to them because by doing so you encourage other criminals to copy such actions and give to their threats
all human beings must have equal rights and opportunities at birth whatever race they may be
discriminate against fools however whatever the color of their skin
all the races that populate the earth were created by the and must be equally respected
humanity as a whole must unite to form a world government as it is written in the book which tells the truth
impose also a new world language on all the school children of the entire world
exists and if no one proposes anything better choose until it becomes possible to abolish money create a new world currency to replace national currencies
therein lies the solution to the monetary crisis
if no one can propose anything better use the system
create a federation from all the countries of the world
grant independence to regions which need to be able to organize themselves as they wish
the world will live in harmony when it is no longer composed of separate countries but consists instead of regions united in a federation to take charge of the destiny of the earth
science is the most important thing of all for humanity
you will keep yourself in touch with the advances made by scientists who can solve i f t he all problems
do not let scientific discoveries fall into the hands of those who think only of making profit nor into the hands of the military who keep certain inventions secret in order to retain a hypothetical supremacy over illusory enemies
science should be your religion for the created you scientifically
by being scientific you please your creators because you are acting as they do and you show them that you understand that you were made in their image and are anxious to take advantage of all the potential that you have within you
science must be used to serve and liberate not to destroy and alienate it
trust those scientists who are not being manipulated by financial interests and you may participate in sports for they are very good for your equilibrium particularly those sports that develop
society should also authorize violent and even very violent sports
these are safety valves
an evolved and nonviolent society must have violent games that maintain an image of violence enabling young people who wish it to be violent with others who wish the same thing
this also allows others to watch these violent exhibitions and so release their aggressive energies
you may participate in games that require thought and use of the mind
but as long as money has not been abolished never play to win money rather play for the pleasure of making your mind function
you will date your writings counting the year as year one after the last of the prophets
then is therefore year after or year of the era of or year of the age of the apocalypse or year of the golden age
t he k t he h b rain the human brain we still have a long way to go in fully understanding the potential of the human brain
the sixth sense direct perception should be developed in young children
this is what we call telepathy
telepathy enables us to communicate directly with our creators the
numerous mediums have come to me asking what they should do because they had received messages from what they call the beyond asking them to get in touch with me in order to help me and for me to bring them the light
mediums are very important people because they have an above average gift of telepathy and their minds are already on the path to an awakened state
they should try to practice meditation in order to fully master their potential
i am eagerly waiting for all those mediums who have received such messages to get in touch with me so that we may organize regular meetings
the true mediums who seek to be informed will all receive instructions
the power of one brain is great but the power of several brains is infinite
let those who have ears hear
never forget that all those things which you do not understand and which scientists can not explain have been created by the
the knows all the parts of the clock he has made
the apocalypse do not forget that the apocalypse literally the age of revelation has arrived as was predicted
it has been said that when the time comes there will be many false prophets
you only have to look around you to see that the time has indeed come
false prophets are writers of of which the newspapers are full and there are also many others who reject the benefits of science and cling to every last letter of ancient writings that were the messages given by the to the primitive people of ancient times
i f t he such false prophets prefer to believe what and primitive people have fearfully copied down long ago while listening to those whom they considered to be gods because they came from the sky
they should instead believe the message of the that has been given now to people who no longer kneel stupidly before all that comes from the sky
these latter people try to understand the universe and they can be addressed as adults
but if you look around you will see the crowds of and religious sects which attract young people thirsty for the truth
a philosopher once said came to show people the path to follow and everybody kept staring at his finger
meditate on this sentence
it is not the messenger who matters but the person who sends the message and the message itself
do not go astray among the sects of the east the truth is not on top of the any more than in or elsewhere
the truth is within you
but if you want to travel and you like exotic places go to all these distant countries
you will understand then that you have wasted your time and that what you were looking for was inside you all the travel within yourself otherwise you are only a tourist someone who passes by and thinks he or she will find the truth by watching others search for it within themselves
they may find it perhaps but those watching them certainly will not
to travel inside yourself you do not need to take a plane
the east has nothing to teach the west about wisdom and awakening the mind
rather the opposite is true
how can you find wisdom amongst people who die from hunger as they watch herds of sacred cows go by on the contrary it is the west with its intellect and its science that comes to help people who for ages have been shackled by primitive and murderous beliefs
it is not by chance that countries in the west no longer face the same problems as those of the third world
where the mind rules the body does not die of hunger
where t he k t he a prevails the body can not survive
can primitive people solve the problems of famine in the world and give food to those who are starving they already have enough difficulties trying to feed themselves and you expect to find wisdom there all the people of the earth had the same chances at the beginning
some have solved their problems and even have more than they need while others simply do not have the means to survive
in your opinion which ones can help the others the people of the west still have an enormous distance to go on the path of but the people of the east have not achieved one tenth of what the people of the west have achieved
communication mind and matter are the same thing
the book of the dead
if you want to have communication of a very high quality do not cut your hair or your beard
certain people have a organ that is sufficiently developed to work well even if their head is shaved
but if you want to achieve the best results then do not cut what the creators have made grow on your head and face
if it grows there is a reason for none of your physical characteristics were given to you without reason
by respecting the creation you respect the the best moment to enter into communication with your creators is on waking because as your body is emerging from sleep your mind is too
a mechanism starts up at that point a mechanism which you must activate by deliberately opening your mind as far as possible to everything around you and to infinity
you should take special care not to halt the process
i f t he sit down or better still lie on your back on the ground
if possible position yourself in the open air and look up towards the sky
the mind is like a rose
in the morning it begins to open but you often prune it when it is still just a bud
if you would wait a little it would bloom
to practice physical fitness is good but to practice the physical fitness of the mind is better
yet do not be impatient if you do not obtain results right away
when an organ is not used it
when you have had a limb in plaster for a long time you need a lot of physical therapy to recover its normal use
look up to the sky and think of your position in the context of everything that you
visualize yourself in relation to the house that you occupy a tiny speck lost between stone walls
see yourself in relation to all the people who are waking up at the same time as you and in relation to those who in other parts of the globe are going to bed
think of all those who are being born those who are uniting with each other physically those who are suffering working or dying at that time all this while you are waking up
yourself in regard to your own level
yourself in relation to the infinitely large as well
think of the town where you are a tiny speck lost in a landscape that is the country the continent or the island where you live
then fly away in your mind as if you were in a plane travelling further and further away from the ground until the town and then the continent are nothing but a tiny spot
be aware of the fact that you are on the earth a small ball where humanity is but a parasite
it is always spinning although you do not realize this is happening
yourself in relation to it and in relation to the moon which is revolving around the earth and in relation to the earth which is revolving around the sun and in relation to the sun which is itself rotating as it revolves around the center of our galaxy
yourself in relation to the stars that are also suns which have planets orbiting them
on these planets an t he k t infinite number of other beings live and among them is the planet of our creators the as well as the planet of the where you may one day be admitted for eternity
locate yourself in relation to all those worlds where other living beings live some more advanced and some more primitive than we are and in relation to those galaxies which themselves revolve around the center of the universe
finally yourself in relation to our whole universe which itself is an atom of an atom of a molecule located perhaps in the arm of somebody who is looking up at the sky wondering whether there is life on other planets  this is all in relation to the infinitely large
then yourself also in relation to your body to all its vital organs and the other parts of which it is made up
think of all those organs that are working without your noticing it right at this very think of your heart which is beating without your asking it to your blood which and your whole body and your brain which enables you to reflect and be conscious of doing so
think of all the that make up your blood and of all the cells that are being born in your body those feeling pleasure while reproducing and those that are dying without your knowing it and perhaps without being conscious that they help form the individual that you are
think too of all the molecules that constitute these cells and the atoms that constitute these molecules revolving like suns around the center of a galaxy and of the particles that make up these atoms and of the particles of these particles on which there is life asking itself if there is life on other planets  this is all in relation to the infinitely small
place yourself in harmony with the infinitely large and with the infinitely small by radiating love towards what is above and towards what is below and by being conscious that you yourself are part of infinity
then by thinking intensely try to transmit your message of love to the our creators try to transmit to them your wish to see them to be among them one day to have the strength to deserve i f t he it to be among the chosen ones
then you will feel light and ready to do good around you with all your strength all day long because you will be in harmony with infinity
you may also do these exercises in the sensual meditation room during the day alone or with other people
but the moment when you come closest to perfect harmony with the infinite will occur when this takes place in your room of sensual meditation with someone you love and you unite yourself physically with him or her and jointly yourselves with infinity during your union
in the evening when the sky is full of stars and the temperature is mild lie down on the ground
look up at the heavens and think intensely of the wishing that some day you may deserve to be amongst them and thinking strongly that you are available and ready to do exactly what they may ask of you even if you do not clearly understand why they are asking it
perhaps you will see a signal if you are sufficiently ready
as you are lying there on your back be aware of the extent to which your organs of perception are limited which explains the difficulty you may have in conceiving of infinity
a force keeps you nailed to the ground you can not fly off to the stars with a jerk and yet you do not see any rope holding you down
millions of people are listening to thousands of radio stations and watching hundreds of television programs that are being broadcast in the atmosphere yet you do not see these waves of sound and vision and you do not hear them
all have their points drawn to the north and yet you neither see nor hear the forces that attract their so i repeat again your organs of perception are very limited and energies like the universe are infinite
wake yourself up and wake up the organs you have within you which will allow you to receive waves that you are not yet picking up or do not even suspect
simple pigeons are able to find the north and you a human being can not
think about this for a moment
t he k t furthermore teach your children whose organs are developing all about this
this is how the new humanity will be born and their faculties will be infinitely superior to those of present human beings
when his growth is finished a man who has never learned to walk will always be a cripple and even if he is taught later he will always be handicapped even if he is very gifted
therefore it is during their growth that you must open the minds of your children so that all their faculties may blossom and they will turn into individuals who have nothing in common with what we are poor primitive people
may this book guide those who recognize and love our creators the
may it guide those who believe in them and those who remember to communicate telepathically with them thus rediscovering the original meaning of prayer
may it guide those who do good to their fellow human beings
may it guide those who believe in what was revealed to me and in what was revealed before me and those who are sure that scientific is a reality
all such people have a guide and an aim in life and are happy
as for those who are not awakened it is useless to speak to them about this message of the
one who is asleep can not hear and the unconscious mind does not wake up in just a few moments especially if the person sleeping finds his or her sleep very comfortable
spread this message around you to those who do good to their fellow human beings
spread it particularly among those who by using the mind that the gave them are relieving society from fear of food shortages disease and the burden of daily exertions
they do this by giving others time to fulfill themselves and blossom and it i f t he is for such individuals that the gardens of the planet of the are reserved
for it is not enough merely to avoid others without doing them any good
anyone whose life has been neutral will be entitled to neutrality
that is to say he will not be recreated neither to pay for crimes which have not been committed nor to receive the reward for nonexistent good deeds
anyone who has made many people suffer during part of his life and then makes up for it by doing as much good as harm will also be neutral
to have the right to scientific on the planet of the one must have an unambiguously positive assessment at the end of ones life
to be satisfied with doing good on a small scale around oneself is enough for someone who is not of superior intelligence or who does not have many means but it is not enough for someone who is very intelligent or someone who has many means
a very intelligent person has a duty to use the mind given to them by the to bring happiness to others by inventing new techniques to improve their living conditions
those people who will be entitled to scientific on the planet of the will live in a world where food will be brought to them without their having to make the slightest effort and where there will be marvelously beautiful female and male partners scientifically created for the sole purpose of satisfying their pleasures
they will live there seeking only to fulfill themselves doing whatever pleases them
as for those who have made others suffer they will be recreated and their suffering will be equal to the pleasure of the
how can you not believe in all this now that science and ancient religions are coming together perfectly you were nothing but matter mere dust yet the made you into living beings in their image capable of dominating matter
later you will again become matter or dust and they will make you live once more as they have created you scientifically
t he k t he r the created the first human beings without knowing that they were doing what had already been done for them
they thought they were only conducting a minor scientific experiment and that is why they destroyed almost all of humanity the first time
but when they understood that they had been created just like us they began to love us as their own children and swore never to try to destroy us again leaving us to overcome our own violence by although the do not directly intervene for or against humanity as a whole they do however exert influence on some individuals whose actions please or them
woe to those claiming to have met the or to have received a message from them if it is not true
their life will become hell and they will regret their lie when faced with all the troubles they will encounter
also those who act against the guide of guides and try to prevent him carrying out his mission or who go along with him in order to spread strife amongst those who follow him they will also see their life become hell
without any obvious influence coming from above they will know why disease family and professional difficulties emotional and other problems will all invade their earthly existence while they await their eternal punishment
you who smile as you read these lines you are among those who would have crucified if you had lived in his time
yet now you want to see members of your family born get married and die under his because this has become part of the morals and customs
behaving like those who went to see the lions the first you also direct ironic smiles at those who believe in these writings saying that they should spend some time in a psychiatric
nowadays when someone has disturbing ideas he is no longer crucified or fed to wild animals this is far too barbaric
rather such people are sent to a psychiatric
had these establishments existed two thousand years ago and those who believed in him would have been confined there
as for those who i f t he believe in eternal life ask them why they weep when they lose a loved for as long as was unable to understand the work of the scientifically it was natural for people to believe in an god
but now that thanks to science you understand that matter is infinitely large and infinitely small you no longer have an excuse to believe in the god that your primitive ancestors believed in
the our creators intend to be recognized by those who are capable now of understanding how life can be created and can make the appropriate comparisons with ancient writings
those people will have the right to eternity
you have read a hundred times that would return yet if he came back you would put him in a psychiatric
come open your eyes
sons of you are still waiting for your and yet you do not open the door
your writings indicate that the new will be born in the west
recognize the anticipated signs
reminded you that the people had made an error in killing the prophets and that the had also made an error in their prophet more than the one who sent him
so welcome the last of the prophets and love those who sent if you recognize the as your creators and if you love them and wish to welcome them if you try to do good to other people by making as much use as you can of all your potential if you think of your creators regularly trying through telepathy to make them understand that you love them if you help the guide of guides to accomplish his mission you will without a doubt be entitled to scientific on the planet of the
when humanity discovered the necessary form of energy to travel to the moon it also came to possess sufficient energy to destroy all life on earth
the hour has drawn near and the moon is rent asunder it says in the verse
therefore any day now humanity can t he k t he r destroy itself
only those who follow the last of the prophets will be saved from destruction
long ago people did not believe and they laughed at him when he made preparations for the destruction
but they did not have the last laugh
when the told the inhabitants of and to leave the city without looking back some did not heed those warnings and were destroyed
now that we have reached the stage when humanity itself may destroy all life on earth only those who recognize the as their creators will be saved from destruction
you may still not believe any of this but when the time comes you will think of these lines again and it will be too late
when the takes place and there is a good chance that it will happen quite soon given the way human beings are presently behaving there will be two sorts of people those who have not recognized their creators and have not followed the last of the prophets and those who have opened their eyes and ears and recognized what was announced a long time ago
the former will undergo the suffering and destruction in the final furnace and the latter will be spared and taken with the guide of guides to the planet of the
there they will enjoy a marvelous life of fulfillment and pleasure with the sages of ancient times
it is they who will be waited on by magnificent athletes with beautifully sculptured bodies who will bring them sophisticated food to savor in the company of men and women of unequalled beauty and charm who will be entirely to their desires
seated on couches wrought with gold and jewels reclining thereon facing each other there will wait on them youths who will not age carrying and and cups filled out of a flowing no headache will they get therefrom nor will they be intoxicated and carrying such fruits as they choose i f t he and flesh of birds as they may desire and there will be fair maidens with wide lovely eyes like pearls we preserved as a reward for what they did
the verses
you who believe in all that is written here when the guide of guides summons you somewhere drop everything for it might be because he has received some information concerning the end
if you are near him at that moment you will be saved and taken away with him far from the suffering
you who believe do not pass judgement on the words or deeds of the
the created does not have the right to judge his creator
respect our prophet and do not pass judgement on his actions or his words for we hear through his ears we see through his eyes and we speak through his mouth
if you lack respect for the prophet you lack respect for those who sent him your creators
the messages which were given earlier by the and all those people who adhered fully to them over the centuries were right
but the systems that were built on these messages using those who had a feeling for them were wrong
the church is in the process of disappearing and it deserves just that
as for the men and women of the church let those who have their eyes open join the last of the prophets and help him spread throughout the world the latest message that has been handed to him
he will welcome them with open arms and they will be able to blossom and fulfill themselves completely while remaining the messengers of those in whom they had always believed
but this time they will at last truly comprehend what the task was when they created humanity and when they sent
they will really be able to fulfill themselves far from the of the church which is fossilized and encrusted with crimes and criminal thousands of years old
they will be t he k t he r able to do what they must do make use of the organs their creators gave them for our creators do not like us failing to use the organs they gave us
the men and women of the church will be able to enjoy their five senses and unite physically forever or for an instant of happiness with they please without feeling guilty
it is now that they should feel guilty guilty of not using all that was given to them by their creators
but released from their old they will truly open peoples minds instead of putting them to sleep already there are almost no more but people who are unhappy those who have in them the vocation to bring love around them and to open peoples minds
fifty years ago there were now there are only this means that there are at least unhappy people human beings who have in them the potential which has been placed in them by our creators so that they use it to radiate
however they do not feel attracted to this church shrouded with crimes and darkness
you who are among those people feeling a need to radiate the truth and do something for your fellow people you who want to remain faithful to your creators and to who told you to love one another and to respect your creators the father who art in heaven you who feel that this message is true come with us and become guides that is to say people who devote themselves to the in the tradition of and and to the spreading of their messages while continuing to live a normal life truly fulfilling yourselves and enjoying all the senses that your creators gave you
you who are presently members of the church take off those clothes that are as sad as their color the color of the crimes that have been committed under their facade
come with us and become guides for humanity on the path of universal peace and love
leave those churches that are nothing but monuments built by primitive people temples where they could adore worthless things pieces of wood and metal
the do not need temples in every city to feel loved
it is sufficient that human beings try to communicate with them telepathically thereby rediscovering the i f t he original meaning of prayer but also opening themselves to infinity and not shutting themselves away in obscure mystical stone hypocrisy and mystification have lasted long enough
using truthful messages as their basis organizations were built and grew fat on them living in misplaced luxury and using peoples fear to achieve their own ends
wars were even waged under the pretext of spreading these messages abroad
shame the money of the poor has been used to build a financial power base
love for ones neighbor has been preached with weapons in hand
human equality has been preached while supporting
god is with us was said to encourage people to launch themselves into wars
shame many times has the following gospel passage been quoted and call no man your father upon the earth for one is your father which is in heaven
 yet in the church they make sure they themselves are constantly called father and and my lord
shame other texts have been read again and again that say provide neither gold nor silver nor brass in your purses nor for your journey neither two coats neither shoes nor yet
 yet they have been wallowing in the luxury of the
shame the pope if he does not sell all the properties of the to help unfortunate people will not be admitted among the righteous on the planet of the
it is shameful to wallow in luxury acquired at the t he k t he r expense of poor people by using true messages and by exploiting the births marriages and deaths of human beings
if all this changes and if those people who were a part of that monstrous organization without understanding their mistake now leave it and regret their error they will be forgiven and entitled to eternity
for the our creators love us their children and forgive all those who sincerely regret their errors
the church has no reason to exist any longer for it was entrusted with spreading the message of in anticipation of the age of the apocalypse and this age has now come
also the church has used methods of disseminating information that are a shame to it
although it has accomplished its mission the church will be for all its crimes and those who still wear its clothes covered with blood will be among the guilty
wake up that you are this is no fabricated story
reread all the writings of the ancient prophets inform yourself about the most recent scientific discoveries especially in biology and look at the sky
the predicted signs are there
the unidentified flying objects which mankind has dubbed flying saucers are appearing there will be signs in the sky that was written a long time ago
once you have informed yourself of these things integrate them all in your mind and wake up
exists he is indeed alive and he has not written what and all the others wrote
he is not a biologist but he is the last of the line of prophets the prophet of the apocalypse that is of the time when everything can be understood
he is living among you right now you are lucky enough to be one of his contemporaries and you are able to receive his teaching
wake up pull yourself together and take to the road
go and see him and help him he needs you
you will be one of the pioneers of the final religion the religion of religions and you will have your place whatever may happen among the righteous for eternity savoring the i f t he delights of the planet of the in the company of wonderfully pleasant beings who are ready to fulfill all your desires
you will follow the guide of guides for he is the ambassador of the our creators our fathers who art in heaven
you will follow all the advice that is given in this book because it is the advice of your creators transmitted by our ambassador the last of the prophets the shepherd of shepherds and you will help him to build the religion of religions
and all you who have other religions open your eyes and your ears reread your holy writings and you will understand that this book is the last one the one predicted by your own prophets
come and join us to prepare for the coming of our creators
write to the guide of guides and he will put you in touch with other people who like you are that is people who understand the message transmitted by
he will put you in touch with a guide in your region so that you may meet regularly to meditate and act to spread this message so that it becomes known throughout the world
you who are reading this message be aware that you are privileged and think of all those who do not yet know about it
do all you can to make sure that no one around you is ignorant of these fantastic revelations without ever trying to convince those to whom you speak
bring this message to their notice and if they are ready they will open up by themselves
constantly repeat to yourself this sentence of its not because no one sees the truth that it becomes an error
you who feel such joy in reading this message and who wish to radiate this truth and make it shine around you you who want to live t he k t he g by devoting yourself totally to our creators by scrupulously applying what they ask by training to guide humanity on the path of and fulfillment you should become a guide if you want to be fully capable of this
write to the guide of guides to and he will welcome you and arrange an initiation which will enable you to radiate this truth fully for you can open the minds of others only if your own mind is open
the love of the creators for their work is immense and you should return this love to them
you must love them as they love you and prove it by assisting their ambassador and his helpers putting all your means and all your strength at their service so that they may travel all over the world to spread this message and build an embassy to welcome our creators
if you wish to help me realize the goals set by the write to me at international movement case or by to headquartersraelorg also do not forget that regular local meetings of people who believe in this final message are held on the first of april on the of august the of and the of each year
the for these meetings will be set out in the liaison bulletin of the movement of your country and some addresses to help you make contact are listed at the end of this book
lets welcome the frequently asked questions this chapter provides answers to those questions that were most frequently raised by journalists during radio and television interviews in which participated worldwide in the years immediately following the publication of his first two books in the seeming contradictions between the first and second message the first contradiction which appeared between the first and second message was found in the beginning of the dialogue which took place between the and you
in the first message when you asked him if it would be possible to visit his planet he replied no you could not live there because the atmosphere is very different from yours and you are not sufficiently prepared to support the journey
nevertheless at the time of the second meeting on you were taken in one of their machines and you spent nearly hours on the planet of the we would remark that on the first contact the machine appeared progressively showing a flashing red light at about ten meters altitude i f t he and descending slowly
when the machine was low enough for you to see the upper part a strong white light was flashing on its top whereas at the time of contact for the delivery of the second message the machine appeared instantly behind the bushes at without any flashing lights and at ground level
also when it returned it disappeared instantly once you had descended from it as if it had
another contradiction at the time of the first contact the had his face surrounded by some sort of halo which he later explained was a sort of space helmet composed of waves whereas at the time of the most recent meeting he had nothing surrounding his face
this contradiction is elsewhere strengthened by what is stated on page in the first message thou not see my face for there shall no man see me and live exodus and this biblical citation is explained thus if man came on our planet he would see the creators without their space helmets but he would die because the atmosphere would not be suitable for him
how do you explain this the explanation for these seeming contradictions is very simple and can be summarized in one word psychology
when one decides to come and make contact with a person living on a primitive planet even though he was created to accomplish a very specific mission there are certain precautions which must be taken so as not to irreversibly damage his psyche
to see a machine appearing in the sky equipped with flashing lights is not traumatic for a man living in a scientifically developed country of our time
he is more or less used to seeing satellites and rockets on and has already seen airplanes and since his childhood and understands to some extent how they operate
the best way to make an appearance without frightening him is to make a gradual approach with a machine equipped with flashing lights like his own airplanes and well known to him
man would find that almost normal and would only be surprised at the absence of noise from a machine seemingly made of metal and b consequently very heavy
the being who appeared to him would have to be dressed in a way resembling how man expects present air pilots and to be dressed
the sort of space helmet covering the face would give him confidence by reminding him of the pilots of flying machines with which he was well acquainted
thus they would be able to reach their objective not to panic the person contacted and at the same time allowing him to see technology which is still unknown to people on earth so that he will understand that he has discovered visitors from another planet
at the time of the second encounter when the flying machine appeared more brutally the were using their technology without camouflage before a witness whom they knew was sufficiently prepared psychologically so as not to be
if they had appeared so brutally at the first encounter the shock would have been too great and my mental balance would have been too disturbed at that time when i expecting anything
in spite of all their precautions the nervous shock brought on the beginning of stomach which took several months to heal
the message was sweet in my mouth but bitter in my stomach
it would have been even more serious without the approach precautions which they took
up to our present day and age our creators were only appearing while trying to impress their creation to the maximum as incapable as they were to understand who these beings from the sky were
the main objective was to make man believe even if they did not understand
now that we are reaching the age of apocalypse which means the age of revelation that is to say the age when everything can be understood and not the end of the world as some would like you to believe and as you can check in any dictionary they have decided to appear while trying to be understood and recognized as our creators those of which all the religious books of the earth are talking including the in which they are called the
this was dictated to the first human beings precisely with the aim to be recognized now that millennia have passed and human knowledge has progressed sufficiently
in this way i f t he we can look at what is coming from the sky without kneeling to pray and shouting miracle
finally it must be remembered that the had decided to test me before giving me the complete message so they went at it most progressively
in spite of my insistent wish to take a trip in their vessel they cut short my demands by stating that it was impossible for me to do so just as people sometimes tell their children that if they drank alcohol they would stop growing
they added the example of the verse in exodus which they addressed to primitive men so that they would stay aloof
these were meant to believe without above all trying to understand
dating the works of the the said they created life on earth years ago
how is it that we find traces of animal bones as old as many hundreds of thousands of years the have explained that they did not create our planet
when they decided to pursue their experiments of creating life scientifically in a laboratory they set out to search the universe for a planet which would have a suitable atmosphere allowing them to work easily
the earth proved to be positive after many tests and then they came down to our planet and created the life forms we now know including humans
t he w o f t he e it mean that or years before their arrival there another creation on earth that could have been destroyed by a natural or an artificial catastrophe
imagine that an atomic war breaks out tomorrow and all life on earth is destroyed
then years later settle down to create new living organisms intelligent beings who would discover traces of our civilization after a slow scientific progression these same beings would find it hard to believe that beings coming from the sky had created them scientifically using as proof the bones which they found to be older than years our bones they might even find the far older bones of that we ourselves still find existing in the debris of our time because the life that exists on earth at present is not the first one to be created and it wont be there has been an infinity of creations on our planet but also an infinity of due for the most part to a lack of wisdom by those who were the equivalent to our humanity
the people of and the in the first message on page it is written that the people of were elected at one of the as the most successful as far as intelligence and genius are concerned
then in the second message on page it is written the are our direct descendants on earth
that is why a special destiny is reserved for them
they are the descendants of the sons of and the daughters of men as written in genesis
is this not contradictory i f t he the people who were chosen by our creators the as being the most accomplished were the people of who had been created in a laboratory at this location on our planet
it is perhaps because these people were the greatest success that the sons of the were tempted by their females and had children by them from whom the people descend
that is how the race the soil of became the people
the movement and money in the first book it is written on page lay not up for yourselves treasures upon earth  no man can serve two masters for either he will hate the one and love the other or else he will hold to the one and despise the other
ye can not serve and
 and the is vigorously attacked for its riches while the movement is asking for money from its members
is it not falling into the same trap as the one must not compare those who live in luxury and recommending their faithful to live poorly and who use these poor peoples money to maintain a myriad of bishops and cardinals to increase continually their real estate investments to maintain a palace of another era with guards wearing one must not compare these with a movement that has not nor will ever t he r a have a paid clergy that had not nor will ever own of the houses and real estate in a capital where people are having problems finding suitable lodgings as is the case in where they refuse to rent to whoever it may be for fear of of the investment that has not and never will have a palace crumbling under the heaviness of gold and silver
we have indeed a need for a lot of money but it will be used to attain these precise objectives
translate the messages of the into every language and bring them to the attention of all the peoples of the earth
 build an embassy where the will be able to meet men officially
this embassy will be neither a palace nor a cathedral but rather a simple house possessing the comforts to which all modern men are entitled with the kind of diplomatic immunity that even the smallest state has for its embassy
finally if by good fortune we succeed in obtaining more money than we need to realize the first two objectives that i have already pointed out and in such a short space of time that we have not yet managed the diffusion of the message all over the planet we will then use the excess money to build a research centre near the embassy
this centre will bring together all the scientists who wish to work on the creation of life in a laboratory allowing mankind to equal their creators
the creation of biological robots will allow the elimination of work and consequently money
also we plan to build a school for the geniuses and the gifted
these research teams will be able to work freely outside the exploiting laboratories the trusts and the suffocation of geniuses by state systems
in this way they will have the opportunity to work without fear of seeing their inventions fall into the hands of powers seeking to use new discoveries to build ever more destructive i f t he nothing is constant in space and time in the first book on page you wrote that the planet of the is a little less than a light year away that being the distance that light can travel in one year or nine thousand billion kilometers since light moves at about three hundred thousand kilometers per second
our present day scientists state that the closest star outside our sun is located four light years away
how do you explain the difference the do not want us to know exactly where their planet is located
this is quite understandable when we consider mans persistence towards destruction even though the level of technology on earth is still fairly primitive
that will all be revealed in more detail when they will officially arrive in the embassy that we will build for them
in the meantime we can only ask questions
scientific members of our movement have put forth an hypothesis the distance between their planet and ours could be about four light years by following the light which could be moving in a pronounced curve but would only be one light year away if we travelled in a straight line
that is a possibility
i might add that light does not move at the same speed in all strata of the universe because nothing is invariable neither in space nor time
this is one of the biggest errors that present scientists are committing
they start with an observation based on a limited period of time to draw conclusions bearing on the past thousands of years and on the time to come or they base conclusions on a limited space to draw conclusions on the infinity of space
man has always made the same mistake of judging according to his knowledge
those who used the horizon as a base reasoned that the earth had to be flat
n i i n pace a t this is also true for historical dating such as the methods based on radioactivity named carbon or all other such methods
there exists a very interesting book which explains all of this very seriously for the scientists who might be interested i am referring to evolution or creation see bibliography at the end of this book
in short the error in these dating methods is to start with the principle that the present atomic movement has always been the same and starting from there to make calculations based on false information because nothing is invariable in the universe in time or in space
to illustrate this error lets take a year old human for example and measure his growth in one year about one millimeter is a good average for most subjects
starting from there we could establish that the man is years old because he measures
meters
we would forget that the growth of this young man has never been invariable
the first year he grew more than since conception between four and five years only between seven and eight years only but between and years another as you will see nothing is constant all efforts to determine the subjects age starting from a partial observation of his growth would be a total failure
one could note that if we started at centimeters in the first year of growth to estimate the age of the person in years of such growth we could predict that this individual would measure
meters at age
in the first book on page you wrote that the had created the original continent years ago from which fragments later detached to form the continents we now know
the continent continued to separate itself from by a few centimeters each year according to certain scientists or by a metre each year as others claim
be that as it may even if it is one metre per year in thousand years we will reach meters or i f t he kilometers but the north continent is many thousands of kilometers away from
how can this be explained the reply to this question is exactly the same as to the previous question
in the growth pattern of a human being the relation between the first year and the year is to one
it is a thousand times greater when we speak of the separation of the continents
here again nothing is invariable neither in time nor space
actually the continents separate only a few centimeters each year perhaps but in the beginning they separated by many hundreds of kilometers each year
recently there occurred an earthquake near the peninsula and people were surprised to note that a fault was created separating two regions by a metre in only one night
and yet we are in a relatively calm period of the history the side effects of the storm of the creation of the original continent by our fathers have had time to calm down in millennia
in the infinity of time and space nothing is invariable not in matter not in transmission of the cellular plan and the forehead bone
it is asked of all those who recognize as having been sent by our creators the and being the last of the prophets to have their cellular plan transmitted by him or by a guide qualified to officiate by him all this so that the genetic code of each may be preserved so as to permit an eventual recreation on the planet of t o f t he p a t he f b one the
on the other hand each is also asked to take the necessary precautions in his or her will so that the forehead bone be sent to the guide of guides after his or her death to what will that avail since the transmission of the cellular plan has already taken the transmission of the cellular plan is a recognition of the as being our creators performed by each while still alive
the conservation of the forehead bone is a recognition of the as being our creators even after death
together they constitute a recognition in life as in death
the cellular plan or genetic code of each individual is registered in an enormous computer which records all our actions during our life from the time of our conception from the meeting of the and the the moment when a new genetic code is registered hence a new individual
this individual will be followed throughout his lifetime and at the end of his life the computer will know if he has the right to eternal life on the planet where the accept only the most conscious of men what happens to a who dies in an accident and whose body is completely destroyed if the in question has taken precautions in his will asking that his forehead bone be sent to the guide of guides there is no problem since it will be registered by the computer which surveys every one of us during the whole of our existence
in the same way there is no problem for the who die without the authorities respecting their last will and testament by refusing the removal of the i f t he said forehead bone
what is important is that each make his or her will known in the manner asked
when there will be millions of the government will be forced to see that their last will and testament are respected by law
the last will and testament of the first were not respected either so long as they were in a minority
will be the dominant religion in the world of the third millennium and then the last will and testament of all will be respected
the majority of people die old
are they recreated old and will they live old obviously not a person who is fortunate in being recreated to live on the planet of the is recreated young with a body in full possession of its force and its resources
at each recreation they will be recreated the same way
it is written that only those who follow you will be saved
if a person has had a life turned towards happiness and the of humanity but has never heard of the messages of the has that person no chance of being saved this person is among the just and will be saved
that part of the messages concerns those who have read the messages
among them only those who have decided to follow the rules given by our creators will be saved
but if there are people on earth who live in seeking above all to help the progress of humanity or to help their fellow men to the most of their ability and who die without having known the t o f t he p a t he f b one messages of our fathers they will be among the just and will be saved
it will be more pardonable for those who do not know about the messages and who act positively than for those who know of them because the latter have no excuse not to have changed their conduct or to have paid even more attention to their actions
is the earth an atom of the finger of god the message explains that our planet is but an atom of an atom of the gigantic being of which we are just a part just as there is intelligent life in the atoms of the atoms of which we are composed
but the great being of which we are only a part could it not be considered as god it all depends on what we mean by the word god
if we are thinking of infinity then yes but only in part because this gigantic being of which we are only a part also lives on a planet which is an atom of another gigantic being and so on to infinity
if we mean by god a being having power over us not at all because there is no such god
the infinitely great being of which the earth is but an atom has no power over us because one must not forget that for that being time passes much more slowly
the time it takes for that being to think of something for us a few millennia have passed
the time taken for beings who live on one of the atoms of our atoms to think of something is for us a of a of a second
this infinitely small being could think that we are god and would be just as wrong as us if we considered the being that we are a part of to be something divine
the universe being infinite there can be no i f t he centre which eliminates the possibility of the existence of an and god the infinite is and we are a part of it as it is a part of us
but it has no power over us and it is infinitely indifferent to our decisions or our behavior
after all there is nothing to prove that the great being of whose particles we are the parasites is human
it is perhaps a dog or a worm the only thing that could be proven by the is that it is something alive
a space craft the messages state that was a spaceship
however there was a discovery a few years ago in a glacier on mount of the remains of a boat which some claimed to be the debris from which it would appear was a boat
how do you explain the pieces of wood which were found have recently been analyzed and it was estimated they were not older than seven hundred years which would put at around ad
even if we admit that the dating system makes enormous errors and that one multiplies the dating by three one would obtain two thousand years which would place the flood at the beginning of the era which makes no sense
even if one day the remains of a wooden boat were found dating back about five thousand years which would correspond with the period of the flood that would not prove that was a wooden boat
one would certainly find near mount pieces of a wooden boat dating back to the epoch of the true flood because at the time when built his spaceship destined to n a a pace raft save certain humans from destruction there were in the ports of his country some wooden boats which had been carried by the enormous tidal waves at the time of the huge responsible for the destruction of all life on earth
just as today we can find in not far from the modern which carried the to the moon some magnificent sailing boats constructed with wood and superb yachts belonging to millionaires
in the case of an atomic war certain could activate enormous tidal waves which would carry away the boats to the tops of the closest mountains like pieces of straw
the eventual survivors could on finding the debris of those boats some centuries later deduce that there must have been an enormous flood to carry them there and since certain writings report that some humans had been saved from this flood having been protected on board a vessel they would be certain that these would be the vessels in question
there is a very important point which helps us to understand clearly that the flood was not the result of a continual rainfall as is generally thought but the result of a colossal having completely and in a very brutal manner overturned the surface of the earth
if it had been caused by continual rain all the boats would have been saved and of course all the sailors and navigators of that epoch would have survived without the least problem
now it is clearly written that only those who were in survived which makes sense it being the only spaceship life after life or dream and reality a book was published recently which related the of people who were brought back to life after having been in a and nearly all of them told the same story of the visions they had as i f t he death approached a vision of harmonious people wearing white robes and singing a vision of people who had disappeared
you claim that after death there is nothing if the do not intervene to recreate those who die
how do you explain this consistency in testimony and does it not prove the existence of a soul all that happens in the human brain is but the result of reactions
be it of love of hate of pleasure of suffering of imagination or all other states of mind sentiment or sickness the process depends in every case on the chemical reactions produced in the interior of the brain and the resulting electrical impulses or messages be they visual based on memory or an interpretation of new events based on elements that one has in the when we breathe very deeply and rapidly we feel elated very soon and if we make one hundred people do the same thing their experience will all be consistent
if we make one hundred people run one kilometer they will all be out of breath
every given phenomenon corresponds to a given physical reaction which will be the same for everyone
when an individual falls into a the brain is by the blood in a certain manner and the brain cells are thus in a certain way and these chemical facts produce certain reactions which are about the same for all of us
if we place acid on it will always make a foam
if we hit the heads of one hundred people strong enough for them to fall into a they will all have the impression of having seen the same thing
indeed they would describe only that which was stored in their memory of the chemical reactions to which they were subjected
it is a bit like when we dream
nobody would think of saying that because he met other people who all dreamt that they were being chased by a bull that was meters high and spitting flames that since many people reported the same thing these sorts of bulls must exist
we have all dreamt at one time or another that we could fly l a o r just by giving a little push with our feet but no one seriously believes that this proves that they can fly around with the swallows or that such a thing would be possible because thousands of people have had the same dream
one must not interpret these dreams as reality even if science endeavors to realize them technically by building an apparatus one day which really allows us to fly
something which all of those who were in a remember well is that they were not anxious to return to their body and this is really not surprising
it would be more accurate to say that they had no desire to be conscious of their body again just as when we come out of a very sweet dream in the company of the opposite sex for example and we try to go back to sleep to recapture the happiness which we experienced
the fact that all people describe almost the same experience proves that identical chemical reactions were produced in the human brain hence their reactions to electrical phenomena are also identical
if we implant in human brains in exactly the same locations and we send them an identical electrical charge they will all feel the same thing and have the same visions
this is exactly what happens at the time of death
if certain privileged people deserve recreation on the planet of the after their death this will happen only when total death has occurred and nothing will happen so long as the person is in a therefore the scientific level of development there does not seem to be as great a as one would expect between our creators and us even though they are years ahead of us
their slow progression gives us the impression that we will be able to accomplish the same things in much less time
how is that i f t he in order to report what i have seen i used words that people of today can understand while placing myself psychologically at the level of the most numerous of those who live in technologically developed countries
in fact we can not even begin to imagine the capacity and the technological level of the
what we are doing at the end of the century of the era would seem miraculous to who lived only years ago as well as to the now living in their forests but what our creators can do would seem equally miraculous to our most advanced scientists if they were showing it to them
normally the will not do it because they want to place us in a state of incomprehension that would inevitably lead to giving value back to beliefs that generate primitive religions
in this way the hope that we will continue above all to seek to understand matter and the forces which surround us by ourselves
in the same manner in which they appeared to me with flashing lights and a sort of space suit so as not to me too much at the beginning while they are able to appear instantly at ground level as they did at the meeting at they could also show humanity technological prowess that even the most imaginative scientists could not understand by themselves
they are capable of doing certain things with infinitely large particles such as planets and even entire solar systems which we still find hard to do with infinitely small particles such as or electrons
what i mean is that they are able to modify the movements of planets within solar systems and even displace some entire solar systems
they are able to do all this by using waves which we are not even aware of yet
lets go back to what was written in the first two messages
we must admit that between our present level of science on earth and the mastery of scientific recreation allowing eternal life for example there is a giant step that our scientists will take a long time to make t he e l even if it is not entirely inconceivable for the most of neither god nor soul but the and the genetic code it is written in the messages that there is no god since the universe being infinite in space could have no centre and there is no soul for much the same reasons
but could it not be said that the replace god in the minds of many and that the possibility of being recreated on the planet of the replaces the idea of a soul allowing access to paradise yes there is no god
the universe is infinite and therefore can not have a centre by definition because of it being infinite
however it is necessary to differentiate between those for whom god is a concept meaning infinity something eternal and having no power over man and those for whom god is a being with a white beard sitting on a cloud who created humans in his image
since the beginning there has been a between two concepts between two totally different things that were put together under the same label
the explained to the first humans that on the one hand there is infinity which is and eternal and of which we are a part and which is part of us and on the other hand themselves the who created us in their i f t he little by little the properties of the infinite were affiliated to the and this is partly true because they are eternal and to the infinite the power of manifestation through celestial messengers is partly true again because in a certain way the could be considered as the instrument of the infinite in their creation of intelligent beings in their image
but the infinite does not constantly watch over us directly and in itself is not conscious of our individual behavior
whether mankind reaches the golden age or is of no importance to the infinite no more than us paying attention to the molecule of our fingers which we leave on a fabric when we touch it
in relation to the infinite it is quite normal that there would be a natural selection at all levels the same as for the man or the dog of which the earth is but an atom of its skull or finger nail and the same for the sun which it or for the billions of inhabited planets that can be found in our thumbnail
those who think of god as infinity as most oriental religions teach are right in as much as it represents a concept without identity and without consciousness of our own existence or any other for that those for whom god is our creators the are not entirely wrong either so long as they do not think of them as beings who must be worshiped on hands and knees or lying down with ones face in the dirt but of elder brothers in the infinite whom we should love as we wish to be loved by the beings that we will create one day
the spirit is a concept whose we will trace so as to better understand its meaning
the word spirit comes from the which means to breathe and the word soul comes from the same root as the word souffle also meaning breath
we can analyze the exact composition of the human body then mix together all the chemical constituents but we will not obtain a living being for all that
something will be missing something which is needed to assemble to articulate to organize it in a well defined plan
take all that is required to build the house of your dreams such as tons of stones a ton of cement of paint two wash a bath n either g n or b t he e a t he g
and put it all in a heap
nevertheless we would not obtain a house because the most important thing is missing the plan
the creation of a person follows the same principle there has to be a plan
this plan is the genetic code which means that by assembling a minute quantity of matter to form the first cell containing a cellular plan we would consider that person is in fact nearly completed
this first cell would use the matter we give it as food to multiply in two then four then eight cells and so on following a precise plan until all the information contained in the genetic specifications has each and every living being possesses a genetic code which differs according to the species or depending on individuals belonging to the same species in certain details such as the color of the eyes the hair the character
even the states clearly that each living being possesses a soul and not only man but flesh with the soul thereof which is the blood thereof shall ye not eat
and surely your blood of your lives will i require at the hand of every beast will i require it and at the hand of man at the hand of every mans brother will i require the soul of man
genesis
for the soul of the flesh is in the blood
therefore there is no ethereal soul flying gracefully from the body after death but there is the genetic code which is the personality of each individual
it is through this genetic code that the proceed to recreate those people whose life on earth is worthy of eternal life on their planet
there is no god but there are the our creators who we wish to welcome as they deserve to be welcomed and in whom we have faith or rather trust
also there is no soul flying from the body after death but there is the genetic code which allows access to eternal life
i f t he the religion of the infinite the movement is an religion whose goals are the diffusion of the messages of given by the to the population and to build an embassy where they will make official contact with the governments of the earth
supposing that humanity showed proof of wisdom and succeeded in avoiding that the messages would be diffused in every language that the embassy is built and that the arrive what will be the function of the religion then and what will its mission be if all that comes about and i am of the opinion that it will even if there is only one chance in a hundred that man will choose the path of wisdom religion will become that of the the infinite
the mission of the guides will then be the teaching of the techniques allowing man to live in harmony with the infinite
these techniques are explained in the keys in the second message and in sensual meditation
in other words all of that which enables man to raise his level of consciousness to refine his perception of the reactions and interchanges produced in his brain
the religion of the infinite is the religion of the absolute and it is inevitably eternal
the mere fact that people years ahead of us scientifically are still faithful to this religion is the proof that this is the absolute religion the eternal religion for all the living species who have reached a universal level of consciousness that is to say the awakening sessions that we organize regularly constitute an approach to this religion of the infinite through sensual meditation
t he f o f t r the future of traditional religions if the come to the embassy accompanied by and and all the great prophets who live on the planet of the what will become of the existing religions the majority would rally to the movement at least those churchgoers who are faithful to the writings of these religions and who are sufficiently intelligent and enough to understand
unfortunately a great number of narrow minded fanatics guided by the clergy of these religions afraid of losing their source of revenue will oppose the general rally
they will allege that the are or that they have been sent by the devil and facing their own they would joyfully him again just as the clergy of the would have burned as a in his own name if he had had the misfortune to fall into their hands in that epoch
i recently had the opportunity to have breakfast with one of the representatives of the community in
during the meal i asked him what he would do if himself told him to do otherwise than that which is written in the old testament
he replied i would continue to apply that which is written in the many people are like him and this is one of the problems with which the are confronted as they seek recognition from humanity
they will have to be stronger than the beliefs that they have engendered
if tomorrow the landed somewhere in the world and explained to the governors who came to meet them and to the media that god does not exist nor the soul and presented in the flesh saying who he is do you believe that the would i f t he place its fortune at his disposal certainly not because the system has taken the upper hand over the fundamental goals of the all nuns are the wives of
would they place themselves at his service if he returned to be the wives of someone who does not exist materially believing that he is alive somewhere and being worried if he really returned that is the problem of the nuns
as a great thinker once said we can not change the minds of people they simply die and are replaced by others more evolved who have a different opinion
time is on our side
certainly there will always be a small nucleus of fanatics but they will die out the same as the religions who the first and whose beliefs have nevertheless totally disappeared
the problem only will arise if the arrive before the present primitive beliefs have totally disappeared
and you published a book entitled from which a political movement was formed called the movement for worldwide
are you not trying to use a religious movement to impose a political doctrine many were particularly interested by the chapter in the first message which explained what the political organization was like on the planet of the and asked me to develop this idea in a which would help them to create a political movement following this ideology
the fact that the wanted us to favor r g the implantation of on earth and at the same time leave men free to understand something better if they could prompted me to agree to write this
later the few more particularly interested in created the party in question and even presented a candidate at an election only a few months after its creation
my position is very clear in all the countries where is progressing
i am on earth primarily to accomplish my mission which consists of spreading the messages of our creators and building the embassy that they have requested
those who are involved with know that i devote all my time to my mission and that even though i wish them the best of results i do not feel concerned with their problems
i have even asked all the guides who have started these political movements to find as quickly as possible other capable of replacing them so that the guides in question can devote themselves to that which in my opinion is more important their work as guides
if candidates do seek to be elected i will always advise the to vote for them
it becomes quite evident that a person can be a and a just as one can be a and a one can have a religion and a political opinion
do not have to get involved with the party in fact quite the contrary
i am convinced that people can do only one thing at a time at least very well so i advise not to become active in the party but to leave that to
when one works eight hours a day and spends all ones free time diffusing the messages each free moment becomes precious
not a single minute should be wasted on a political movement when it could be spent diffusing the messages
one must make a choice and a political ideology does not weigh very much when compared with the messages of the
i have set the ball rolling with and i am now counting on to run it
perhaps it will develop into something enormous which will save humanity or perhaps humanity will save itself without even if they come to it later
the only important thing is that the embassy will i f t he soon be built this is my only concern my only preoccupation and it should be the only concern and the only preoccupation of all true
the priority of priorities is the building of the embassy for our creators so that we can welcome them in the company of the ancient messengers and
this is my only reason for being on this earth
this must become the only reason for living for all those people who wish to help me
who created the creator of the creators the created us and other people from another planet created them
who created the creators of the the infinite in space is easier for man to understand than the infinite in time
once we have attained sufficient we can understand that in space the earth is but a particle of the atom of the atoms of the hand of a gigantic being who contemplates a sky which composes the hand the stomach or the foot of a being even more gigantic who finds himself under a sky
 ad infinitum
the same process applies for the infinitely small
on the atom of the atoms of our hands there exist intelligent beings for whom these particles are planets and stars and these beings are composed of atoms of which the particles are the stars and the planets on which there are intelligent beings
 also to infinity
infinity in time becomes more difficult for man to understand because man is born one day he lives a certain number of years and dies but he would like everything in the universe to be limited in time as he is
for the man who is not awakened the idea that w t he o f t he anything in the universe could be eternal is unbearable even if this were the universe itself
our present day scientists abide by the same rule and say the universe must measure so many kilometers and must be so many millions of years old
whether in space or in time we can only measure the part of the universe that we can sense
everything is eternal be it in the form of matter or energy and we ourselves are composed of eternal matter
the were created by people from another planet who had been created by other people coming from another planet and so on to infinity
it is as foolish to search for the beginning of the universe in time as it is to search for the beginning of space
let us get back to the example where intelligent beings are living on the particle of one of the atoms of our hand and for whom this particle is a planet
in relation to space the scientists on this microscopic planet located for example in the middle of the bone marrow of the first phalanx of our right index finger these scientists will at first claim that the other particles that they can observe with the naked eye revolve around the centre of their world their planet the particle on which they are located
for these scientists it is obvious that their planet is the centre of the universe
but they will progress and one day a genius will prove that their sun does not revolve around their planet and that the stars also do not revolve around their little world but rather it is their planet that turns on itself in a near motionless sky as well as turning around their sun at the same time
he will probably be burnt for his theories by the of their particle planet but a day will come when people having discovered more sophisticated instruments of observation will prove that he was right
then the learned scientists of that period will proceed to measure the universe in all modesty saying that it stretches from the farthest star particle located at one end of the sky to the farthest star particle located at the other end
this measurement will represent only one of a of the area of our finger where they happen to i f t he be located
but since they can not see any further they will assume that the universe stops where they can no longer observe
but the observation techniques will progress even more and they will start to perceive that there are other galaxies and clusters of galaxies
be that as it may it will prove only that the universe is greater than had been anticipated and it will always measure so many thousand kilometers or lightyears a little more than before or times more eventually nevertheless it will always measure something
we have reached this point in our progression on earth
but let us get back to the planet located on our finger
science is always progressing and the inhabitants of our phalanx are now at the level to launch always more space explorations
they finally reach a new frontier the bone of which their planet is but an atom of an atom
this way they can be sure that the universe measures so much by so much
the proof is that after that point there is nothing more to be observed
a little later they succeed in crossing the immensity which separates the bone from the muscle and their universe gains new dimensions again
they improve their and finally reach the layer of skin which covers our finger
they have reached the end of their universe which measures centimeters by our scale but was many lightyears for them
they will still be able however to pursue their space explorations inside the rest of our body
they will follow certain currents where the stars are moving mysteriously at very high speeds gigantic corridors which they will chart to permit them to come and go freely from their planet but little will they know that they are travelling in our blood vessels
their universe will be measured demarcated
it will have a particular height width and depth
an incredible number of lightyears on their scale but only
meters for us
they will not yet have discovered that our feet for example are standing on a planet which for them is itself made up of a great number of galaxies which their narrow minds always wanting to place frontiers everywhere can not even begin to imagine and grasp
for the quantity w t he o f t he of atoms contained within the earth is immeasurable compared with the number within our body
they would also have to become conscious that there are other like us who are walking on this planet and that in our sky there are other stars and other galaxies and so on to infinity
only some of the wisest of them having reached a superior level of consciousness allowing them to be in tune with the universe will thus be able to teach all this to their disciples at a time where for the official scientists their universe measured only a of a of a millimeter of the bone of our finger which they could observe only from the inside  the concept of infinity in time is the very same thing
the scientists of that could measure the age of their universe by measuring the age of the molecule of which their planet is but an atom of an atom and the universe would have that age
then they would realize that the age of the cell of which the molecule that they thought to be the total universe while it was in fact only a part is much greater
then they would discover that the limb of which this cell is but a part is much older still and that the age of the being of which this member is but a part is even greater and so on to infinity
what is the purpose of life what is the purpose of life as stated in the messages everything must be estimated in relation to four levels
our life means nothing when compared with the infinite
if we die if all of humanity disappears it will not change anything in the infinity of time or space
the gigantic being of whom i f t he we are a parasite of a particle of an atom will continue to exist without noticing anything and the whole of the history of mankind since its creation will have only lasted a of a second for him
the living beings on the atoms of the atoms of our hand will continue to exist as if nothing had happened even if the atom on which their universe is located is buried deep in the earth in the flow of blood coming from our finger torn away by an explosion for example
even if this drop of blood is swallowed by a worm that retains the atom in which their universe is located to constitute new cells for its growth this will not affect the living beings on this little world any more than it would affect the beings living on the atoms which make up the cells of their own fingers  in relation to the our life is very important because we are their children and we must show them that we are proud of having been privileged enough to have been created in their image
that is to say able to become conscious of the infinite and also one day able to create people in our own image in return
in relation to human society our life is equally very important because we are the result of a long list of survivors who have escaped the epidemics and wars which have made us the offspring of a long natural selection
we owe it to ourselves to participate actively in the plan that will allow humanity to reach the golden age which it greatly deserves and which it is about to enter
we are the cells of this huge being that is humanity and at the time of the birth of this humanity each cell each one of us is very important in that he or she has a role to play
finally in relation to our own self our life has only the importance that we give it
if we recognize the as our creators and if we wish to contribute to the diffusion of the messages so that they will be known all over the earth so that mankind enters the golden age and if we enjoy our participation in this gigantic endeavor then we are enjoying life for that reason
the question was what is the purpose of life life was made to be enjoyed whether you find pleasure in the diffusion of the messages of our creators or pleasure in contributing to the entry of humanity w hat i t he p o f l into the golden age or pleasure in pleasing yourself by putting yourself in tune with the infinite or by any other means
what is pleasure what is pleasure pleasure is the reaction of an organism which has accomplished an act producing pleasant chemical reactions
a baby experiences pleasure while its mothers breast because its hunger is appeased and because the chemical reaction produced by the milk on the of the tongue produces a pleasant sensation
all our senses are there to give us pleasure and sensual meditation is based on an improvement of the perception of pleasure provoked by the chemical reactions transmitted by our everything we do during our life we do because it gives us pleasure
there is not one action performed during our entire life which is not done for pleasure
the person who pays his income tax does it because it pleases him not to have to go to jail for not having paid it
the woman who throws herself under the wheels of a car to save her child does it because it pleases her to see her child survive even if it means being wounded in the process
and the soldier who throws himself under enemy fire in order to save his battalion does so because it pleases him to die for his comrades
the suicide pilots of are the ultimate example of this type of heroism pleasure
there is a difference between direct pleasures such as immediate sensual satisfaction and indirect pleasures such as the choice of behavior which we spoke of earlier and which are a reaction to i f t he exterior without resulting in a conscious development of our means of perception of the environment
it is only when conscious pleasure is obtained in solitude in an attempt to improve the quality of ones perception that true can take place
we are linked to the infinite through our senses
someone who can not see hear smell touch or taste would actually be dead even if his heart was still beating
he would not be conscious of his environment and would therefore possess no intelligence
it is important to note that those who are deprived of one sense develop the remaining senses to a much greater extent than people with all their senses
blind people for example develop an acute sense of hearing that we can not grasp or can read with their fingertips
scientific experiments have demonstrated that the pleasure centre is located within the brain
this was discovered by placing in that part of the brain and sending small electrical discharges
the people who were experimented on felt something which was close to an orgasm the satisfaction of having made a new discovery and the feeling of being honorably quoted in public all in one go
it was then proven by complementary measures that it was this same pleasure centre which was activated when one was reaching sexual orgasm or when discovering something or when an artist had finished a masterpiece or when a soldier received a medal
better still another experiment demonstrated that artists who were sexually aroused while creating noticed an increase in their potential of creativity
nothing could be more logical
pleasure increases the potential of creativity because it stimulates all our senses and a creator must be linked to infinity in order to have a harmonious masterpiece born
we must then strive towards improving the quality of our perception of pleasure by increasing the sensitivity of all our senses
as a direct result other than the increased enjoyment this increase in sensitivity will develop our total potential of creativity so that the w hat i p rest of humanity may benefit from our creations thus improving the general level of consciousness
this is what is being taught at the courses of awakening that we organize for the
by improving the level of individual consciousness we improve the level of consciousness of humanity and so increase the chances of entering the golden age
in order to change society we must first change the individuals of which it is composed
violence is always produced by those who are by improving the individuals happiness we help to lessen the potential for violence
moreover and quite often violence is produced by individuals who believe that they are unhappy and the art of politicians is to strengthen this belief so as to overthrow those in power to take their place
then the former use the same tactics to reach the same goals thus maintaining a feeling of dissatisfaction which could one day through the amplification of successive result in the general feeling that the cause of the dissatisfaction is in another country
this is how wars are started
if each individual becomes conscious of the infinite by developing his own sensuality then the whole of society will be transformed
this will start by the awakening of the consciousness of people more developed than others who once they have attained a certain level will become guides for the people around them and will allow others to become fully awakened who will in turn awaken others and so on
thus gradually the level of consciousness of humanity will be raised to such a point that a fatal world conflict would become impossible
the process has already started and thousands of small nonviolent manifestations have taken place around the world organized by students or intellectuals in favor of peace of unilateral disarmament of a country and it is amplified by television the central nervous system of humanity
each individual contributes at each moment of his life to the awakening or the stifling of planetary consciousness
you must not be i f t he afraid to influence others as we are here for that purpose
but we should direct all our efforts and every word that we say at every moment so that all we say and every action we do has a positive influence on the course of human history
one must never seek to convince others because people who perceive that we are trying to convince them have a tendency to strengthen their position
whereas if one discovers a point in common with the others philosophy then one can concentrate on this common point and from there a new path for our listener so that he will have the impression of having found it out by it is foolish to say that we will not influence anyone else by stubbornly following our own way and letting others follow theirs
the mere fact of not trying to influence others influences them even more than if one takes a fanatical stand on something
people fear fanaticism more and more whatever the subject and they are right to do so
this is in fact the beginning of wisdom
on earth there are people who seek the truth and show it and others who seek the truth and hide it but there is not one single person who does not seek it
then there are people who pretend that they have found the truth and show it too often concerned with maintaining traditions and last there are people who have found the real truth and show it the
we are very interested in those people who seek the truth and show it because it shows that they are sincere and generally very intelligent and relatively harmonious
in any case for the most part they are ready to accept a new vision of the world without fearing that this change will them to the point of them
these people represent a great majority of they are the pioneers
those people who seek the truth and hide it are also very important to us but they will be more than likely to join us when they have overcome their and no longer worry what other people think of them
w hat i p those people who pretend that they have found the truth and show it will come to us when it becomes evident that nothing is constant in the universe and therefore it is nonsense to try to preserve traditions that no longer mean anything
they just love their traditions but could not care less about what god really is
all of these people do this for pleasure
the latter get pleasure in thinking that their children will pray in exactly the same way as they have and that their children will teach their own children the very same ways of praying even though school will teach them that man is descended from the monkey
so what if it is wrong what is important to them is for the teaching at school to be respected yet also for what the priest says to be respected
the fact that they are both contradictory is neither here nor there what is important is that they are both traditions and according to these lovers of tradition it is not up to us to question which one is right
would surely a second time if he himself were to ask them not to go to church on or not to their children before they had reached adulthood
this is the position adopted by the worshippers of tradition
those people who seek the truth and hide it feel pleasure in thinking that what people think they are is more important than what they truly are
those people would not they would even be against it but they would still not intervene or even say anything
they do not want to get involved in anything not even if it means defending what they believe to be the truth
when all of humanity enjoys its sensuality to the full the risk of a world conflict will have disappeared
at the root of all violence there are always dissatisfied people
this is why we must learn to enjoy all of our senses and help everyone around us to discover their total sensuality starting with children
it is not sufficient to show them how it works like sexual education tends to do but we must teach them how to use it so as to obtain and give more pleasure
sexual education should be replaced by sensual education
i f t he pleasure is always fulfilling direct pleasure that is and not the pleasure of the soldier who dies for his comrades
direct pleasure develops in each individual the means to become in tune with the infinite and really feel a part of the infinite
our body is nothing more than an accumulation of atoms organized according to a master plan the genetic code which interacts with the environment through an infinity of chemical reactions of which we are not always aware
raising our level of consciousness corresponds to feeling an even greater number of these chemical reactions so as to better ourselves in the infinite and so as to become more harmonious
when we feel linked to the universe eternal and infinite we can never be unhappy because we have then discovered the pleasure of being
what is death what is death death in relation to the infinite means nothing
the matter of which we are composed is eternal
therefore we are made of eternity
the infinitely small particles which compose our nose existed before they became part of us
some of these particles were contained in the steak that our mother ate while we were in the womb and those particles passed through her body and became part of our face
other particles were in the fruit that we ate yesterday they came into our abdomen and then travelled through our bloodstream to land on our nose
this is true for every part of our body
after death the reaction will be exactly the same
the particles will return to the earth to be and some particles will land in animals others in plants but w hat i most of them will remain in the earth for you are dust and you will return to dust
death however is the final for the mass formed by this accumulation of organized matter which makes up what we are
death is the beginning of the process of dispersion of the matter of which we are composed
but to understand death one must truly understand what life is all about
life is nothing other than the organization of the
the came on earth at a time when life did not exist
there existed only matter at our level what we call the biological level
they took this matter they it as stated in the and they shaped it to create living beings
this was all done at the molecular level but for primitive man this was impossible to understand so they related it to pottery
they believed that the creators took a little piece of clay and created man like you would do a flower pot
it is true that the creators did take chemical components from the earth but they combined them scientifically in such a way that the inanimate became animated
every living thing on earth has been created by the starting from a basic brick a molecular structure composed of atoms judiciously assembled
our scientists are starting to discover that all living things animal or vegetable man or beast have similar basic components
its like a sort of alphabet where every letter is an atom which makes up the genetic code of each living species
the order in which the letters are placed may differ with each species but the letters of the alphabet would always remain the same
so with one relatively simple brick our creators were able to make an enormous quantity of houses that differed in their appearance but which were all identical in their basic components
when the species reproduce they are doing no more than reproducing the genetic code of the first model of their species
so then life is the organization of the and death is disorganization of the organized
i f t he life is like a house that would build itself by itself starting from its own plan and furthermore it would maintain itself automatically
death is the end of this automatic maintenance and the beginning of the dispersion of the basic materials of which the house is made finally ending in the destruction of the plan which it had contained
the great architects of our universe who have designed the plans of these houses designed a type which would be capable one day of matching its creators and becoming architects themselves by creating other plans able to build houses which build themselves by themselves
this type of superior house is man who will soon be able to create new synthetic genetic codes new plans starting from inanimate matter
the living being was created with the ability of himself in his own environment through his perception feelers his senses
humans are nothing more than biological computers
there is no difference between humans and highly sophisticated biological computers such as those we are now able to produce only our computers are far more perfected and can perform far more accurately than a human
the computers can be equipped with means enabling them to themselves in their own environment
recently a computer was equipped with wheels enabling it to move by itself around obstacles thanks to cameras wired to its brain
it can see exactly as we can with our eyes and it can move in its environment
a computer only does what it has been programmed for and so does man but let us continue our comparison between man and the as far as hearing is concerned it is easy to endow a computer with a microphone that will pick up noise as we do with our ears
it is also possible to give it an which will identify the perfumes that surround it just as we do with our nose
then it is also possible to give it a taste that would indicate the taste of various substances as we do with our mouth
w hat i finally it is possible to equip the computer with feelers capable of functions that we perform with our hands such as measuring temperature hardness and weight
better still the computer can be equipped with organs infinitely superior to our human organs
let us take sight for example
the cameras used on the computer can be equipped with multiple lenses including a lens which will enable it to see clearly what is going on many kilometers away or a microscopic object things that the human eye is unable to see unless equipped with artificial such as binoculars or microscopes
the same thing applies to the sense of hearing
while we can only perceive the sounds that exist around us in a very narrow range certain animals like dogs can perceive a wider range
so our computer can be equipped with sensitive to or and directional microphones allowing it to hear sounds that are many kilometers away at a precise location
getting back to sight the cameras could be equipped to pick up ultraviolet or infrared rays enabling it to see at night something we are not capable of doing with our limited vision
and as for the sense of smell the odor could identify odors and instantly transmit the chemical composition of the perfumes or surrounding gases something which our nose could for the sense of taste we could also equip it with flavor capable of making a detailed chemical analysis of any given substance
finally for the sense of touch we could give it feelers a touch mechanism able to analyze with precision the temperature the weight and the hardness of objects or substances other than saying its hot or its heavy
it would also be able to manipulate things at temperatures that our skin could not endure things weighing a thousand times more than our poor human muscles could lift
we could go even further and equip our computer with senses that man does not possess or that he is unable to make use of
we could for example give it radar permitting it to move in complete darkness a sonar an detector a compass a gravity detector a radio i f t he communication system so many senses that our body is not provided with and that we can not even perceive except with the use of electronic that we can rarely have altogether in the same place and at any given time
let us compare the energy requirements of the human computer and the machine
when a man needs energy he says i am hungry looks for food and eats it
scientists have recently completed a computer equipped with electrical batteries
it works and its cameras enable it to move and to store and move about heavy boxes just like a forklift truck
suddenly the battery charge becomes too weak and it loses its efficiency
its energy indicator shows that the time has come to charge the batteries
then by itself it will move to an electrical outlet plug itself in and wait patiently until the charge is sufficient then itself and return to work
this is no different from the man who says i am hungry and proceeds to the cafeteria to get food at and then returns to work
what happens when a man is injured he stops working he gets medical attention then returns to work
a computer can be programmed for just as it was programmed to feed itself
if one of its parts becomes defective it will go to a workshop remove the part and replace it with a new one and this is done without human help
this computer will then become eternal and will never be faced as man is with the issue of death
man is able to reproduce himself and so is the computer
it only needs to be programmed accordingly
if a computer is programmed to make of itself which have the ability to do the very same thing then in a very short time we will have an population of computers
this is why they must not be programmed to reproduce for humans this is called the species conservation instinct the unconscious desire to reproduce
humans find pleasure in unaware that they are in fact responding to an impulse the species conservation instinct
if there was no pleasure in then there would be no reproduction
the human genetic code was programmed so that pleasure is obtained through in order for reproduction to take place
the humans who w hat i use a contraceptive method such as the pill the cap or the
make a fantastic to their genetic code
they consciously take pleasure without it leading to reproduction
pleasure always brings an expansion of the mind but overpopulation is certainly a serious danger for humanity contraception is a magnificent way that humans have of showing that they are conscious of themselves and conscious of the importance of their actions in regard to the whole of humanity
let us get back to our computer it could also be programmed to feel pleasure in doing certain things
every computer which performs as it has been programmed to perform experiences pleasure from its performance
when the computer feels that its energy level is low it says this is wrong then runs over to
when it feels the new energy running through its circuits it can say this is good and in doing so feels pleasure
what goes into the program of a computer information contained in a memory bank that will rule the behavior of the computer
if it is programmed to calculate it will calculate if it is programmed to draw it will draw if is programmed to play music it will play music
but it will not play music if it has been programmed to calculate and vice versa unless of course it has been programmed for both how is a human programmed on the one hand there is the genetic code which is filled with information related to his behavior to his sensual means which enable him to communicate with his environment to his physical means so that he can move feed himself reproduce
this is what each human receives at birth more or less in relation to his heredity and which constitutes the innate
on the other hand his education will provide him with a language so that he can communicate with his fellow humans laws which will regulate his behavior a set of moral values a teaching a concept of the world a religion
all these things will determine the individuals behavior
the individual will be under the impression that he is performing on his own of living in a world where his values are those which he has chosen but they will be only those which his i f t he education has imposed upon him those ideas received from people who have played the role of educator or programmer
this is called experience
ordinary people unconscious people are incapable of doing anything other than that which they have been programmed for by their or by their experience by their heredity and by their educators
the total man the man who raises his level of consciousness so as to himself in the infinity of space and time becomes a computer
he can question the program which has been imposed on him by his education without asking advice and replace his total or partial education with a new and more appropriate set of values that will seem better in relation to higher standards than those antiquated ones which had motivated his family and his environment
those standards were aimed generally at conditioning him to keep alive the traditions of the past of times when men were totally primitive with a low level of consciousness in their conception of the world and the role that humans had been created to play in it
an ordinary man who wishes to become a total man a man with a higher level of consciousness which would enable him to exploit a little more than per cent of his brain percentage used by ordinary men and partial men must be able to do his own brainwashing
this operation will enable him to look at everything in his brain to put back what seems to be good and to disregard what seems to be bad
he will keep his own ideas and get rid of the ones he received either from other people his family or his environment ideas which he has received from those people who wanted to model him after their own conventions and for their own convenience
this applies to his behavior his reactions to world events the way he awakens gets up gets dressed works speaks to others and listens to them the of his sexual life
everything each gesture no matter how small or insignificant it may seem
a total man is conscious of each movement of his eyebrows and the effect it could have on the people surrounding him
w hat i quite obviously this great spring cleaning in order to be efficient must be done in the company of someone who has already crossed the line which separates ordinary men from the infinite universe of total man someone who knows all the different paths and who is able to lead this new traveller in the proper direction and to guide without forcing him letting him choose his own path freely
a mans consciousness is a house which has been built usually by other people based on standards which have never been questioned since the same thing had been done to them and to their parents before them
the total man will destroy this house and build a new one adapted to his taste and to his imagination
he will recover from the old ruins certain things which seem and combining them with the new components he will build a new house perfectly suitable to his new personality
men have houses built in conformity to their level of consciousness
houses have always been square or rectangular with slanted roof tops and nothing could change that
they keep building the same type of house over and over again
every house is like a temple with vertical walls like pillars and a slanted rooftop like a pyramid sitting on top of the pillars
modern construction techniques allow for more when building a house
for instance it could be completely round it could have the shape of a ball or an egg or an pyramid or a bird or a tree
houses which are built in series all looking exactly the same and forming morbid looking uniform villages are the exact reflection of the level of consciousness of their inhabitants
and yet paradoxically the house is a typical example of mans capacity for
the has always built his nest in the same way and it can not change that because this is programmed into its genetic code
man however is capable of adapting his shelter to his environment
he can build temples pyramids huts wooden cottages skyscrapers made of iron and cement cathedrals made of stone and towers made of metal or glass
the mere fact that man is a computer does not make him different from the machine
all computers can be i f t he programmed to do the same as we do and like us they could be programmed to reproduce themselves
it could be also possible to program a computer so that it could be
it would be able to live to work to reproduce itself from a basic program based on its experiences and to give this information to its descendants to the computers that it would reproduce
we could even imagine a mind expanding computer which would have the ability to awaken the programs of already existing computers which had been created as non so that this feature would be transmitted to them  man is therefore starting to discover through the machine that there is nothing mysterious about himself nor his origins nor his behavior
everything that a man can do a computer can do and what is more it can do it much better
this applies to everything that can be done by a human and it includes artistic creativity
there are computers capable of composing music of drawing and so on
we could never find a human ability that can not be programmed in a computer even getting in tune with the infinite could be programmed
all of this is simply fantastic and man is able to look upon himself as a wonderful machine and concentrate wholeheartedly on seeking happiness and total through the fulfillment of his own needs and that of his fellow men in order to build a world in which all men will be happy to feel that they are infinite and eternal
sexual freedom and no obligation the message mentioned total sexual freedom
but for a couple who read the books and wish to become does it become mandatory to practice the exchange of partners f n o o freedom to do something and obligation are two different things which must not be confused
a couple who love each other deeply where both partners do not wish to share a sexual experience with other couples should stay together
if they feel happy being with each other without the need to experience anything else that is just fine
everyone must do as he or she pleases
sexual freedom of choosing a single partner once you have discovered who you really are and once you have discovered a partner who fills your every need and whose every need you seem to fill becomes a question of choice to live together
however quite often an experience with another person will render you more appreciative of your partners company as you become more conscious of his or her qualities
in so far as sexual contacts are concerned everything is possible everything is permitted
i must insist on the word permitted for it does not mean since the creation of the movement i have had the opportunity to see many couples start new relationships
some of these seem to be so successful that i can very well see what they hope to gain in seeing other partners
perhaps these experiences would only confirm that they are truly made for each other
some people are sufficiently awakened to understand that the experience in itself is not really necessary
when a man is totally conscious he does not need to do something to find out what the result is going to be he knows it he can feel it unless the experience is aimed at the awakening of a disciple or it is felt essential to his own personal progression
each person is free to follow his own chosen path so long as the following three fundamental rules are observed respect the tastes and decisions of others in the free choice of their partners be permanently conscious that others do not belong to us and that nobody can be the owner of anybody and always seek above anything else the happiness of those we claim to love
i f t he on this basis everything is possible couples and of living a perfect happiness whether they be homosexuals or
and what is the position of the movement on it is quite simple each individual has the right to do with his or her body as he or she sees fit
is not a normal or abnormal mode of behavior
each person must live an harmonious sexual life corresponding to tastes and natural tendencies
in the mothers womb the sexual differentiation is felt at a very late stage of development
there are very masculine men and men who are more feminine just as there are women who are virile and others who are very feminine with all the possible and shades in it is foolish to condemn a homosexual because he is a homosexual just as it would be foolish to condemn a man because he is a man or a cat because it is a cat as all of this is genetic
many types of animals are homosexual and in the country one can see frequently dogs cattle and chickens indulging in homosexual behavior
is as natural as a dog or a hen is natural
what is not natural is the wish to others to have the same sexuality as oneself
it is generally what those who torture people who do not resemble them are doing
they are generally the same as those who are traditionalist and militarist
r a h the aggression aimed at homosexual people is a form of
it usually comes from people who lead a miserable sex life and can not tolerate that others could blossom while living something else
these same people who condemn will forgive very easily a man charged with raping a woman even though it is an crime
among the guides there are male and female homosexuals there are and
all of them are because they are conscious of being loved as they are with the opportunity to fulfill themselves living in their body as they please in a communion of thought that no other religion is able to give them
how can one still be a follower when one hears the condemn while depriving women of their rights of becoming priests
these are two of and that can help those who have eyes to see the truth
and evolutionists the false prophets it is written when the age of the apocalypse will arrive there will be many false prophets
who are they there are many false prophets in our day and age
do not forget the meaning of the word prophet its
it means the one who reveals as we have stated earlier
the false prophets of our time that is to say those who reveal or teach false information are all those people who try to bring humanity back to primitive beliefs in an immaterial and yet god who watches over each human being to either punish or reward him as the case may be
it is a concept which the infinite which is indeed i f t he in its totality because of it being infinite in space and eternal in time yet without any consciousness of its own and thus with no power over humanity as a whole nor over any single person for that matter and the who are our creators who are real and in this sector of the infinite but who love us their children and who allow us to evolve freely in our scientific and spiritual progression
the second category of contemporary false prophets are all those people scientists or not who claim that life on earth and therefore humanity is the result of successive random chance events which all happened during what they call evolution
as said there can not be a watch without a watchmaker
all those people who believe that we came from the monkey through a slow evolutionary process believe that the beautiful watch which we are has built itself by accident
it is a bit like saying that if we put all the components of a watch together in a bag and shook it around for a while we would eventually get a perfect working watch
try a billion times if you so the evolutionists are also false prophets false people who lead the majority of the population away from the truth about our creators the
this population which easily swallows and believes in everything said by these high priests in white coats who compose the majority of the scientific community is purposely kept ignorant and so inevitably believes that which officialdom says is true
can you begin to imagine what the feel when they see that humans attribute their masterpiece to random chance it is said in the second message that one who suffers too much pain has the right to commit suicide
does it mean that suicide is a good we will all be judged according to our actions while living on this earth
the person with more positive than negative actions will be entitled to eternal life on the planet of the
if a person suffers too much physically and if human science is unable to relieve his pain then he has a right to put an end to his life
if most of his actions in his life were positive he will be recreated to live
if they were mainly negative he will not be recreated and for him there will be nothing
however if most of his actions were negative he could be recreated to be judged later by those same people whom he made to suffer
someone who is not physically suffering or who has no handicap must not commit suicide as we all have a mission to accomplish on this earth especially
they must their lives to the diffusion of the messages given by the of whom they are the
to end ones life is like an act of treason its like running from ones post during combat
i am referring to the combat which will awaken humanity and allow it to survive in order to reach the golden age
the are counting on each one of us and each is very precious to our creators
allow me to repeat myself the only time when suicide is acceptable is when a person is in extreme physical pain which can not be relieved by science or when his faculties have diminished to the point where he can no longer act effectively
all other people are messengers of our fathers who are in the sky and we must all our lives to the spreading of the good news
the new revelations his chapter contains revelations that the had asked to keep secret until three years after his journey when the second message was revealed to him
now that we are in the year these things can be known to all
the devil does not exist i met him do not tremble when wondering if a creature with horns with feet well hidden waits for the right moment to come and prick your backside with a
since there is no god sitting on a white cloud holding a flash of lightning in his right hand the devil does not exist either
for the average person devil or demon are different names attributed to a single person who is one and the same and personifies the forces of evil just as they would think of apocalypse as meaning the end of the world
let us trace the true meaning of these words
is chronologically the most ancient
when the created the first completely synthetic living beings in the laboratories on their original planet a certain group of people from their world protested against these genetic manipulations which they thought were dangerous for their civilization
they were afraid that one day the scientists would create monsters that would escape from the laboratories and would commit murders within the population
unfortunately we know that t he n r t he evil n e i et h this is what happened and the movement that was trying to have this genetic engineering work forbidden
so the government of the planet of the ordered the scientists to halt their experiments and forced them to destroy all their works
the group which led the battle against these genetic manipulations was presided by an called
the scientists were finally permitted to go to another planet and pursue their experiments
a description of this event is described in
it is a parable which describes the works of the creation of life on other planets by the a went forth to sow and when he some seeds fell by the way side and the came and devoured them up
the birds are the messengers sent by who thought that the planet chosen for their creation of life experiments was far too close to their own and that if by chance the beings created in a laboratory were in fact more intelligent than their creators and became violent they could prove to be dangerous for the population of the planet
the government gave them permission to once again destroy the works of the scientists
they had to search for another planet which lent itself to the creation of life but they failed twice
the first time the chosen planet was too close to a star and the creation was burnt by the harmful rays coming from that star and on the second one they were invaded by the vegetation
finally they reached a planet which offered all the necessary elements so that their creation could survive and it was located far enough away so as not to show any signs of danger in the eyes of the association presided over by
some fell upon stony places where they had not much earth and they sprung up because they had no of earth and when the sun was up they were scorched and because they had no root they withered away
and some fell among thorns i f t he and the thorns sprung up and choked them but other fell into good ground and brought forth fruit some an some some
who hath ears to hear let him hear
 we know the also created life on two other planets at that time hence the allusion to three harvests
we also know that the permission which allowed the scientists to come to earth to create life was granted to them on the sole condition that they did not create people in their image
the first message explains how they this order and also shows the reaction of their government which strictly forbade them to reveal to the first terrestrial men whom they had fabricated how they had been created and who they were and demanded that these first men be obligated to fear their creators by asking the creators to show themselves as supernatural beings divine beings in some way
thought that one could not expect anything good from these scientifically created creatures and that out of man only evil could so we understand perfectly that was just one of the leading in some way a political party on the planet that was opposed to the creation of artificial beings in their image by other who themselves thought that they could create positive and nonviolent then came which means light bearer
is one of the who created life on earth thus created man
was heading a small group of scientists working in one of the genetic engineering laboratories which studied the behavior of the first synthetic men
noticing the extraordinary aptitudes exhibited by their creation decided to the order and reveal to these first humans that those whom they had mistaken for gods where in fact men like themselves made of flesh and blood and who came from another planet in flying machines made of palpable material
and the who followed him felt love and t he n r t he evil n e i et h affection for their created humans
they started to love these beings as their own children these beings that they studied all day long who were obliged to look upon them as gods
they could not bear to see their creatures who seemed to be a physical and psychological success and who were beautiful and intelligent on their hands and knees them as if they were idols all of this just because the government of their planet of origin of which was the president strictly forbade them from telling their creations the truth and forced the to play the role of supernatural beings permanently
the bearer of light enlightened the first men when he revealed that the creators were not gods but men like themselves
this attitude is directly opposed to that of who thinks that only evil can be expected from men and also to the president of the council of the governing the planet
so far no creature with horns
condemns the scientists who had disobeyed his orders to spend the rest of their lives in exile on earth
he condemns the serpent to crawl on earth as it is so poetically written and man from the laboratory the garden of where they were fed and lodged without having to make the slightest effort
but give up over this as what he wishes is that all the beings that have been created be totally destroyed because he judges them to be dangerous due to their violence
as time passes accumulates proof of mans aggression by observing the way in which humans kill each other with the weapons that are given to them by the sons of exiled group of
the latter is involved in tender relations with the daughters of men who manage to receive weapons in exchange for their charms under the false pretense of giving them to their fathers or brothers so that they can hunt for food
in fact men choose to fight battles among themselves with this arsenal
seeing the of such a slaughter brought by before the council of the decides to do what asks that is to say totally destroy the life that has been created on earth and i f t he by the same token allow group to return to their own planet and be forgiven thus putting an end to their exile
but when group learns that their fabulous creation is soon to be destroyed they decide that they can not allow that
they still feel very strongly that among men there are some who are positive and nonviolent full of love and fraternity
among these was whom they helped build a space craft which would protect him from destruction by staying in orbit around the earth
this craft contained a few men and women and the genetic codes of some animal species which would be used to recreate them after the
it was only then that the discovered that they too had been created in the same manner that they had created man scientifically in a laboratory by other people coming from another world
they then decided never again to destroy humanity and helped group to the life forms preserved in the
is still convinced of the evil in man but he bows before the majority of those who behind think the contrary within the council of the
understood through the message contained in the spaceship coming from another planet which landed on their planet that if men are violent they will when they discover energies enabling them to enter an interplanetary level of civilization
the decided to let men progress by themselves but chose certain people or had them born on earth who would be responsible for the creation of the religions which were designed to keep traces of their work on earth so that the creators of man would be recognized as such when the time came when mankind had sufficiently evolved scientifically to be able to understand rationally
messages of such importance could be given only to trustworthy people and first of all the had to assure themselves that their chosen ones were faithful to their creators so that they would not betray what was revealed to them
so was given the responsibility of testing the prophets
how are they going to test the of these people once a person has been contacted by the messengers of the telling t he n r t he evil n e i et h him of his mission or one of his men would contact the and by would destroy the in his mind trying to get the human to his fathers or to accept to betray his mission on the promise of material advantages for example
what is the word for slanderer in simply
here is our famous devil but he still has no horns no hooves  for example was taken into the desert for forty days for his initiation period and was at certain times confronted with the devil to see if he would deny his father then was led up of the spirit into the wilderness to be tempted of the devil
 or to be clearer was taken to the desert to be tested by a slanderer
the many tests imposed by the devil are also described
first of all he asks to turn the stones into bread to prove he is the son if thou art the son of god command that these stones become bread
but he answered and said it is written man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that out of the mouth of god
 tells that it is more important to be faithful to the than to eat
the devil is tempting him with food since has for quite some time
then is carried to the pinnacle of the temple and told to jump so that the angels of god will cushion his fall to prevent him from being injured if thou art the son of god cast down for it is written he shall give his angels charge concerning thee and on their hands they shall bear thee up lest thou dash thy foot against a i f t he stone
said unto him again it is written thou not make trial of the lord thy god
 replies to the devil that he has not been placed on earth for the useless exercise of testing his creators thus proving that he does not ask for their help at every moment
then leads to the top of a high mountain and proposes to make him a great and very rich king on the earth
again the devil him unto an exceeding high mountain and him all the kingdoms of the world and the glory of them and he said unto him all these things will i give thee if thou wilt fall down and worship me
then saith unto him get thee hence for it is written thou worship the lord thy god and him only thou serve
then the devil him and behold angels came and ministered unto him
 shows his loyalty to the whom he prefers to serve rather than become a powerful and rich man
it must be noted in these verses that refers to the slanderer by his name since he calls him
since the test was successful the angels the messengers came down to to complete the initiation
was not the only one to be tested by the devil job was also tested by
the beginning of the book of job is quite eloquent as it shows clearly what good relations or even relations there were between and now there was a day when the sons of came to present themselves before and came also among them
and said unto whence comest thou then answered and said from going to and in the earth and from walking up and down in it
and said unto hast thou considered my servant job that there is none t he n r t he evil n e i et h like him in the earth a perfect and an upright man one that and evil then answered and said job fear for hast not thou made an hedge about him and about his house and about all that he hath on every side thou hast blessed the work of his hands and his substance is increased in the land
but put forth thine hand now and touch all that he hath and he will curse thee to thy face
and said unto behold all that he hath is in thy power only upon himself put not forth thine hand
so went forth from the presence of
job
we can see clearly that is above in the hierarchy
but still he authorizes in his capacity of opposition party leader to do as he pleases by giving him job so to speak so that he can prove that he can take a man who loves the profoundly and bring him to hate them if he is afflicted by misfortunes ruin or sickness
in fact ruins job totally but the latter continues to love and show respect for the then job arose and rent his mantle and shaved his head and fell down upon the ground and worshipped and said naked came i out of my mothers womb and naked shall i return thither gave and hath taken away blessed be the name of
in all this job sinned not nor charged foolishly
job
but give up he reports to the president of the council of the again there was a day when the sons of came to present themselves before and came also among them to present himself before
and said unto from whence comest thou and answered and i f t he said from going to and in the earth and from walking up and down in it
and said unto hast thou considered my servant job that there is none like him in the earth a perfect and an upright man one that and evil and still he fast his integrity although thou me against him to destroy him without cause
and answered and said skin for skin yea all that a man hath will he give for his life
but put forth thine hand now and touch his bone and his flesh and he will curse thee to thy face
and said unto behold he is in thine hand but save his life job
therefore allows to ruin jobs health so as to see if he will always love his creators
and job continues to respect the
only then he began to ask why he had been brought into the world if it was only to be afflicted with all kinds of misfortunes
finally and briefly explains to job what has happened
tells job that he is wrong to judge his creators who ran the test and to regret having been born
jobs health and even more possessions than he had before he was ruined
at the end of the meeting i had with on the relay vessel he stepped out for a few moments telling me that he would meet with me later
then one of the other two asked me to follow he took me to a small room marvelously decorated
the walls were like the interior of a round pyramid and those walls were covered with luminous sound waves which gave the impression of multicolored water waves
everything was moving to a marvelously relaxing rhythm of musical
after having me seated in a comfortable chair which was covered with black fur giving it the impression of being alive he said i must warn you that among the there is not only one opinion as to the future of humanity on earth
thinks that men are good and he feels that we should let them progress by themselves convinced that if they are negative they will
t he n r t he evil n e i et h all my many followers and i think that men are evil and that we should help mankind hasten its
we propose that you help us accelerate the final which would only purify the universe of beings who are only the result of an unsuccessful experiment
if you try to accomplish the mission given to you by you will always remain a poor man and you will have to put up with the sarcasm of everyone
you will suffer perhaps even be put in jail or even worse put to death by your own blood brothers
if you accept my offer and carry out my plan based on increasing the various tendencies existing in human beings so that a racial world conflict erupts i will make you very powerful and rich
your role will consist of publishing the books which i will dictate to you and which will enable you to create various political and spiritual movements preaching the destruction of the race the yellow race and the black race who have taken over all the riches and the raw materials that the white race needs and deserves to have since it was the efforts of white men which permitted them to develop techniques to search for them and to utilize them in the first place
as soon as this planetary conflict breaks out you and all those people who have helped you to bring it about will be saved
we will take you to safety on board one of our crafts and eventually you will be allowed to return to earth when everything has been destroyed so that you can start a new humanity
you will govern this new civilization as you may desire and with our help of course
in the meantime as soon as you return to earth there will be a sum of billion billion billion or more if you wish deposited in the name of a foundation in a bank account to help you get started
tell us what that sum should be and if it is not sufficient other deposits will be made immediately
furthermore if you accept to help us you and all of those people who will have helped you will have the right to eternal life
the only thing we ask is that you do so so that humanity the horrible civilization that is theirs today
for this you will also have to tell them that you have met with an extraterrestrial and he i f t he has warned you of an invasion of the earth by them
we will give you the necessary of our existence and no one will doubt your words anymore
in this way humanity will increase its armaments to prepare itself against possible attack from the sky
this will prevent from another approach attempting to stop men from killing each other from building up an even greater stock of nuclear weapons and aggression on earth
consider on the one hand some people are asking you to work for an already lost cause since sooner or later men will blow themselves off the face of the earth
these same people will not even give you of their existence to help you to convince your brothers nor any financial aid
they will leave you to face the sarcasm the police and judicial pressures that might lead you to prison without counting the possibility that some might kill you because you claim that there is no god
on the other hand my proposition makes you a rich and very powerful man immediately a man who will only have accelerated a course in which humans are already so what is your decision do you want to think about it for a few days before giving me your answer and i answered i am not at all convinced that humanity will even though there is a nine out of ten chance that it will
even if there was only one chance in a thousand that humanity suppressed its aggression and escaped destruction i think that it would be worthwhile taking this one chance
i would like to think that men will understand before it is too late
and even if the final occurred told me that all the people who will have fought for peace and will be saved in order to the earth and try to build a loving world
your proposition does not offer anything more except perhaps that in your plan only those people who will have contributed to the explosion of violence will be saved
the new civilization which they would then structure could not avoid being violent because of the dominant characteristics of its founders directly socially and
t he n r t he evil n e i et h the mere fact of telling humanity of the invasion of earth by would be sufficient to trigger more fear and then increase aggression on our planet
so even if there is only one chance in a thousand that the earth could be saved at the present time this chance would be cut in half upon hearing the news of a possible intervention on your part
one of the most important factors which can contribute to lessening violence between men is the awakening of the mind to the universe and to the infinite
if all men looked to the sky with hope and fraternity then they would feel much closer to each other and would think less about killing each other
i am not interested in becoming rich and powerful
i have almost nothing but the little i have is all that i need to live very happily
my mission which i am accomplishing fills my life with happiness
all i need is food for my children and a roof over their heads
all of this has been given to me by faithful disciples who wish to help me bring the truth to all the people of earth
i can not live in two houses at the same time nor can i drive two cars simultaneously and even if i owned my house that does not mean that i could sleep any better nor would the fire be warmer
as for the mission entrusted to me by i would much rather that it be carried out through the collective efforts of those who wish to welcome the as this would certainly be the most beautiful proof of love that we can give to our creators
so you are refusing my proposition asked the
yes and for all the reasons which i have just mentioned since i am fundamentally opposed to violence
are you sure you will never regret this he asked
would you not rather wait and think about it i will never change my mind no matter what happens to me
even if my life was in danger i would much rather direct my efforts so that love and fraternity unite all men so that they welcome their creators as the deserve to be welcomed
at that moment the door opened and entered with the other
he told me i am very pleased with the reaction that you have had to the proposals which were made to you
i was i f t he convinced of your reactions but our brother who has just tested you will not be convinced that something good can be expected of men until they are united and money and all weapons are destroyed
my second companion who is so happy with your behavior is who was the first to put faith in mankind even before i had understood the need to let humanity progress and let man go alone through the final test of resolving violence without an intervention on our part
then told me that he thought there were not more than a dozen men like me on earth
love and fraternity shone from his face and he was of the opinion that it was not because some rare exceptions existed that humanity deserved the right to exist
then we returned to the more spacious of the two ships the one that would bring me to the planet of the where my initiation was to be completed
all of this is related in the book which contains the second message took me to their my father who art in heaven on my first encounter with this extraterrestrial whom i did not then know to be the president of the council of the i was wondering why they had chosen me to become their messenger on earth
he told me that they had decided to choose someone after the first atomic explosion at which took place on august
then he added we have been following you since your birth and even before
refer to
of the book which tells the truth
in the beginning i found this answer to be very intriguing and during the two years between the first and second message i often pondered on this subject
i had to wait until i met again to clarify this matter in full
t he n r y father w a i n h he revealed the truth of my origins at the end of his remarks addressed to the people of as reported in the second message when we were then on the planet of the
once again i was told to put on one of these belts with a large buckle which enables one to travel in the air by following certain wave currents
i found myself flying about meters above vegetation after a smooth exit from the laboratory where my mind had been modified in the strange chair
in ten seconds or so we had reached a clearing where a few prophets with whom i had a meal earlier were sitting
a few hundred meters below i could see immense and magnificent sandy beaches bordering on a sea of deep blue waters of such depth and beauty that none of the coves of the sea could match it or even come close
the blue of the water was like that of a swimming pool but it spread out to the horizon with great pink and green areas within the blue sea
when i looked more attentively i could see traces of every color each more beautiful than the next as if the bottom of the sea had been painted for some kilometers
i asked where these extraordinary colors had come from and was told that the seaweed gave the water its coloration
the seaweed had been created and implanted artistically to produce the special effect that i had noticed
the belt allowed me to descend gently in the small clearing near the group of ten or so prophets
the one who had been introduced to me as came to meet us
following we all went and sat on seats carved out of the rock
all the seats were covered with this black fur which seemed to be alive
we were located on a cliff overlooking the sea
asked me if during the last two years since our first meeting there had been some question which has preoccupied me more particularly
without hesitation i told him that i had often wondered what he had meant when he had explained we have been following you since your birth and even before
i had twisted the question many times in my mind wondering if it had meant that my parents had been chosen before my conception i f t he and if they had been guided telepathically to each other to bear me or if they already knew each other when they were chosen or if i had been conceived when they were chosen or rather when the embryo which they had created was chosen
answered this question that was very important to me
his answer was even more extraordinary than i had anticipated
at that moment he stopped addressing me in by the polite form of vous and started addressing me by the personal form of
he the person whom you looked upon as your father was not your real father
after the explosion at we decided that the time had come for us to send a new messenger on earth
he would be the last prophet but the first one to address mankind asking them to understand and not to believe
we then selected a woman as we had done in the time of
this woman was taken aboard one of our ships and as we had done with the mother of
then she was freed after we had totally erased from her memory all traces of what had happened
but before all of this had happened we had arranged so that she would meet a man who could support the child financially and would raise him decently
this man had to be from a different religion than that of the woman so that the child could be raised without strong religious conditioning
this is why the man whom you took for your father and believed that he truly was was a
your real father is also the father of and that makes you brothers
you are presently looking at your father
your was like he was to take care of you and your mother until such time as you could provide for yourself
from this moment on you can talk to me using because you are my son and i am your of the entire journey this was the most touching moment
and i could see in eyes an equally great emotion and feeling of love
too seemed to be moved by the same feelings
then i kissed my father and my brother for the very first time
t he n r y father w a i n h then asked me not to reveal this parental tie until three years had passed
this is the reason why i have never talked about it in any case it is of no importance we must not make the same mistake as those men who recognized as a messenger who came from the heavens
it is not the messenger who is important but the message itself
came on earth to show the way but men kept looking at his finger
said a great thinker and it is unfortunately true
i am also showing you the path to follow in revealing the messages given to me by my father who is in heaven
it is more important to recognize the as our fathers and to prepare their embassy on earth as they requested than to pay attention to the messenger
only the messages are important and through them the recognition of those who sent them but not the messenger
do not look at my finger but rather in the direction in which its message from to the men of the earth the apocalypse of the final nuclear i through the words of my prophet address all the people of earth there is unfortunately but one chance in one hundred that your humanity will not and every must act as if mankind would be wise enough to understand and grab this tiny chance of escaping the final so as to enter the golden age
better still each by his work of awakening minds contributes to strengthening this unique and minute chance of survival to prevent it from becoming even weaker
i f t he it is impossible to predict the future for it is impossible to travel in time but it is always possible to predict the future of a biological entity and the whole of humanity can be considered as a biological entity
if a primitive woman was by a scientist the latter could predict this future
he could predict that in nine months she would give birth to a child and could even go so far as determining the sex of the child
in the same way we who are used to creating life on an infinity of planets know what happens to a humanity which has reached your level of technology without having reached an equivalent level of this is why although we can not predict the future of individuals we can predict however what should normally happen to a living organism during the period or to a humanity in the course of its development
when the first cell is created in the mothers womb by the meeting of the and the this first cell contains all the necessary information to create a complete being able to accomplish a multitude of functions
and the more numerous the cells the more numerous are the functions developed
the number of functions is proportional to the number of cells obtained by successive divisions until the child is ready to be born because only then does he become a complete organism with all the organs which he will require to accomplish all the functions which will fill his every need
it is exactly the same thing for humanity considering each human to be like a cell of the great being in that is humanity
the number of functions of discoveries and the technological level of mankind is proportional to the number of humans
in this way we can easily predict that the age of the apocalypse will be achieved when men are able to make the blind recover their sight with electronic when mans voice will be carried beyond the oceans through satellite and when man will be equal to those he had mistaken for god by creating synthetic beings in a laboratory
t he n r f y to t he en o f t he e all these predictions rely on an knowledge of the biology of the species
we know that a will develop his eyes at a certain month of his growth and his sexual organs at another month and that the same rule applies to all living species which are developing
we know that it will make discoveries permitting the accomplishment of such and such a scientific prowess after so many hundreds or thousands of years
its exactly the same thing
we have dictated our messages to the prophets of old so as to be recognized by men when the time would come for us to show ourselves openly without this creating new religions ie
when all men would be capable of understanding
among these texts is the apocalypse which we dictated to john
we showed him through a similar to your television sets the events which would happen to men when they would reach the age of the apocalypse
the text of the apocalypse of john was unfortunately overloaded and distorted by primitive who could not be anything other than people
john starts his story by telling of his encounter with us i was in the spirit on the lords day and i heard behind me a great voice as of a trumpet
revelation
here he explains that he is trying to communicate with us telepathically this is what he calls being in the spirit on the referred to as the lords day and that he heard a metallic voice as of a trumpet this is something you all know the sounds produced by an electrical loudspeaker
then john turned around to see what was behind him then i turned to see the voice that spoke with me
and having turned i saw seven golden and in the midst of the seven one like the son of man clothed with a garment down to the feet and about the chest with a i f t he golden band
his head and hair were white like wool as white as snow and his eyes like a flame of fire his feet were like fine brass as if refined in a furnace and his voice as the sound of many waters he had in his right hand seven stars out of his mouth went a sharp sword and his countenance was like the sun shining in its strength
revelation
john saw seven flying machines made of a golden metal seven golden in the middle of which stood a little being one like the son of man dressed in a flying suit which was molded to his body even his feet and he is wearing a large belt
his skin and his hair are white his helmet is equipped with two small which john mistook for his eyes
his feet are standing on thick insulated soles of yellow metal and he speaks with a powerful voice and his voice as the sound of many waters
in his hand the little person holds an apparatus made of seven luminous signals which are to the seven vessels placed near him
the sword on the other hand is only a detail added later on by the to reinforce the menace of apparition to increase the power of god and the fear of god of the first
the being who appeared in front of john was indeed one john fell with his face to the ground and when i saw him i fell at his feet as one dead
and he laid his right hand upon me saying fear not i am the first and the last and the living one and i was dead and behold i am alive for and i have the keys of death and of
write therefore the things which thou and the things which are and the things which shall come to pass hereafter
revelation t he n r f y to t he en o f t he e we asked john to get up and we told him that he must write everything that he had seen and everything that would be dictated to him so that men could find those writings when the time would come
we told him that we were the first and the last that is to say the first on earth and the last if men when they discover energies to permit them to do so
we explained to him that the one who was speaking had known death but had been recreated thanks to the process explained in the first message which permits us to live through many bodies
and behold a door opened in heaven and the first voice that i heard a voice as of a trumpet speaking with me one saying come up hither and i will show thee the things which must come to pass hereafter
straightway i was in the spirit and behold there was a throne set in heaven and one sitting upon the throne
revelation
john sees a door opened in heaven the door of one of our machines is opened and he is taken inside on a carrying ray
this is totally incomprehensible for him and this is why he says in the there he sees someone sitting in a chair and around him a total of other people also sitting on thrones
i was this person sitting on the throne and around me were sitting other representing the council of the the governing body of our planet
then i turned on the apparatus designed to visualize thoughts and he saw what would normally happen to humanity and also what would happen when the time would come and i saw and behold a white horse and he that sat on him had a bow and a crown was given unto him and he went forth conquering and to conquer
revelation
i f t he this is in relation to the first of the seven seals or if you prefer the seven chapters of the history of humanity
this is in fact the triumph of on earth and it allows the old testament to be revealed to everyone
then the second seal is opened and there went out another horse that was red and power was given to him that sat thereon to take peace from the earth and that they should kill one another and there was given unto him a great sword
revelation
this red horse represents the religious wars and wars in general which will be one of the principal causes in the tardiness of humans to increase their number
then comes the third seal and i beheld and lo a black horse and he that sat on him had a pair of balances in his hand
and i heard a voice in the midst of the four beasts say a measure of wheat for a penny and three measures of barley for a penny and see thou hurt not the oil and the wine
revelation
the black horse is the famine which will claim a considerable number of lives before mankind solves the problem on earth completely
and then comes the fourth seal and i looked and behold a pale horse and his name that sat on him was death and hell followed with him
revelation
this pale horse represents the great epidemics and and many others which have humanity
then the fifth seal is t he n r f y to t he en o f t he e when he opened the fifth seal i saw under the altar the souls of those who had been for the word of god and for the testimony which they held
and they cried with a loud voice saying how long o lord holy and true until you judge and avenge our blood on those who dwell on the earth then a white robe was given to each of them and it was said to them that they should rest a little while longer until both the number of their fellow servants and their brethren who would be killed as they were was completed
revelation
this scene represents what happened when the great prophets living in our company on our planet asked us to allow men who had lived a positive life to be recreated before the final judgment
we gave permission so that a few thousand people from earth who we recreated could live among us immediately whereas first we had decided to keep their genetic code in order to recreate them only when humanity had completed its evolution
then the sixth seal was opened i looked when he opened the sixth seal and behold there was a great earthquake and the sun became black as of hair and the moon became like blood
and the stars of heaven fell to the earth as a fig tree drops its late when it is shaken by a mighty wind
then the sky receded as a when it is rolled up and every mountain and island was moved out of its place
and the kings of the earth the great men the rich men the commanders the mighty men every slave and every free man hid themselves in the caves and in the rocks of the mountains
revelation
i f t he the sixth seal represents the final danger for humanity the greatest danger the one which could destroy it completely the atomic war
the great earthquake is the explosion itself the black sun is the darkening of the sky by the mushroom cloud and the fallout dust that you all know so well will the moon
the sky receded as a is when the clouds are chased abruptly by the sudden surge of hot air coming from the explosion
the men who hide in the rocks of the mountains are the people who rush into shelters
it is from this final if it happens that people who will have followed our prophet will be saved those people who will have had their cellular plan transmitted after having read or heard of the messages
those people will have been selected by our huge computer which follows all people from conception to death
then i saw another angel ascending from the east having the seal of the living god
and he cried with a loud voice to the four angels to whom it was granted to harm the earth and the sea saying do not harm the earth the sea or the trees till we have sealed the servants of our god on their foreheads
revelation
the people who will be sealed in the forehead will be those who will have their cellular plan transmitted by manual contact between our prophet and their forehead bone which contains the purest and the most authentic genetic code
the total of those who will be sealed in the forehead will be around which will include those people already recreated on our planet those people who will have led a life dedicated to the of humanity without ever hearing of the messages and also those people who will recognize as our messenger after having read the messages
for as long as the total of these human beings does not reach we will help to delay the final so as to have a t he n r f y to t he en o f t he e sufficient number to start a new generation on earth when it has become a suitable place again for humans to live
if the sixth seal represents the discovery and the first utilization of the atomic weapon the seventh seal represents the final a worldwide atomic war which ends with the destruction of all life on when the first trumpet of the seventh seal sounded  and there followed hail and fire mingled with blood and they were cast upon the earth and the third part of trees was burnt up and all green grass was burnt up
revelation
one third of the earth is burnt by radioactivity the trees and the green grass no longer grow
and the second angel sounded and as it were a great mountain burning with fire was cast into the sea and the third part of the sea became blood and the third part of the creatures which were in the sea and had life died and the third part of the ships were destroyed
revelation
the explosion produced an enormous eruption of lava which ran into the ocean destroying one third of the marine life and one third of the ships
and the third angel sounded and there fell a great star from heaven burning as it were a lamp and it fell upon the third part of the rivers and upon the fountains of waters and the name of the star is called and the third part of the waters became and many men died of the waters because they were made bitter
revelation
i f t he atomic follow in retort to the first attack the missiles great burning stars from heaven fall everywhere
most of the drinking water becomes polluted and many people die from it
and the fourth angel sounded and the third part of the sun was smitten and the third part of the moon and the third part of the stars so as the third part of them was darkened and the day shone not for a third part of it and the night likewise
revelation
the dust and the ashes raised by successive nuclear are so thick that the sky is darkened the sun the moon and the stars which gives the impression that the day and the night are and the fifth angel sounded and i saw a star fall from heaven unto the earth and to him was given the key of the bottomless and he opened the bottomless pit and there arose a smoke out of the pit as the smoke of a great furnace and the sun and the air were darkened by reason of the smoke of the pit
revelation
this is the description of a missile falling and the mushroom cloud it creates
then out of the smoke came upon the earth
and to them was given power as the of the earth have power
they were commanded not to harm the grass of the earth or any green thing or any tree but only those men who do not have the seal of god on their foreheads
and they were not given authority to kill them but to torment t he n r f y to t he en o f t he e them for five months
their torment was like the torment of a when it strikes a man
in those days men will seek death and will not find it they will desire to die and death will flee from them
revelation
the are airplanes loaded with atomic bombs which will fall on the great cities and through exposure to radioactivity will inflict terrible suffering on those people who will have survived the
they will be poisoned by radiation in much the same way as one can be poisoned by the sting of a
and the shapes of the were like unto horses prepared unto battle and on their heads were as it were crowns like gold and their faces were as the faces of men
and they had hair as the hair of women and their teeth were as the teeth of lions
and they had as it were of iron and the sound of their wings was as the sound of of many horses running to battle
and they had tails like unto and there were stings in their tails and their power was to hurt men five months
revelation
those metallic covered with metal looked like horses going to war in the eyes of a primitive man
they had a cockpit inside of which a mans face could be seen as the faces of men and in flying very high they left behind a trail of white smoke that john calls hair and their teeth are the missiles tucked under their wings
the of iron are the fuselage and the noise comes from the jet engines as is familiar to you
the power in the tails like unto i f t he is the radiation produced by the missiles which were dropped on the population of the countries that were attacked
and the sixth angel sounded and i heard a voice from the four horns of the golden altar which is before  revelation
john describes the four loudspeakers located in front of me while i was making him see all this
and thus i saw the horses in the vision and them that sat on them having of fire and of and and the heads of the horses were as the heads of lions and out of their mouths issued fire and smoke and
by these three was the third part of men killed by the fire and by the smoke and by the which issued out of their for their power is in their mouth and in their tails for their tails were like unto serpents and had heads and with them they do hurt
revelation
again this is the description of more planes the heads of the horses are the from which flames and smoke come out
the tail with heads with them they do hurt are the nuclear missiles and you can understand that the heads refers to the head of the missile whether its or not
we gave john the most detailed description possible and this story reflects what he had seen with his primitive eyes
take this same story and tell it to an then ask him to write it down in his own words and you will get approximately the same type of recollection more so if you ask of his fellow tribe members to transcribe the story while the first man is not present
t he n r f y to t he en o f t he e and when the seven had uttered their voices i was about to write and i heard a voice from heaven saying unto me seal up those things which the seven uttered and write them not
revelation
at this point we clearly told john that there was no god and that we were men like him and also we explained that he should keep this as a secret and not write it so as not to create a greater confusion among the people who still needed a crutch to lean on until the day when humanity had reached a sufficient level of technology when everyone could understand what we had spoken of
but in the days of the sounding of the seventh angel when he is about to sound the mystery of god would be finished as he declared to his servants the prophets
revelation
we clearly explained to him that when the time would come men would understand that there is no god and by the same token would also understand that we were their creators
 for the devil is come down unto you having great wrath because he knoweth that he hath but a short time
revelation
this final test of humanity that is the choice between or the passage into the golden age is the last opportunity for to prove that he was right in saying that humanity was bad
if humanity brilliantly overcomes this last ordeal and succeeds in obtaining total disarmament on the planet then men will have proven themselves worthy of receiving our inheritance since they will have shown they are truly nonviolent
the beast as described further on in the text is simply the use of nuclear energy for murderous means i f t he here is wisdom
let him that hath understanding count the number of the beast for it is the number of a man and his number is six hundred and six
revelation
in fact is the number of human generations which will have existed on earth since the creation of the first men in the original laboratories
the very first humans were created some years ago and a human generation is estimated at an average of years so if one multiplies by it equals years
the generation born at the beginning of the age of apocalypse in of the era was in fact the since the creation of the first man in a laboratory by the
this generation coincides precisely with the first use of nuclear energy for destructive purposes at on august
once again interpretation was not required in order to understand
one had only to read what had been written
was effectively the number of man the number of men who descended from the creation that is to say the number of generations
and there were voices and and and there was a great earthquake such as was not since men were upon the earth so mighty an earthquake and so great
revelation
the from the atomic are tremendous and they are increased if they start a chain reaction
and every island fled away and the mountains were not found
revelation
this monstrous explosion due to a chain reaction will brutally divide the continents engulfing the islands and sweeping the mountains like a wisp of straw
t he n r f y to t he en o f t he e and there fell upon men a great hail out of heaven every stone about the weight of a talent
revelation
in those parts of the earth untouched by the bombs rocks are falling from the sky thousands of kilometers away from where the bombs had fallen
and i saw a new heaven and a new earth for the first heaven and the first earth were passed away and there was no more sea
revelation
john was able to see what one could see from a rocket moving away from the earth
it seemed as if it was the earth that was retreating rather than the craft itself moving away
then the spacecraft travels through a sky unfamiliar to a man of the earth a new heaven
then the spaceship reaches another planet a new earth
and i john saw the holy city new coming down from out of heaven prepared as a bride adorned for her husband
revelation
looking from the spacecraft the primitive has the feeling that the city towards which the spacecraft is going is coming down out of heaven while it is evidently the spacecraft that is approaching
and i heard a great voice out of heaven saying behold the of is with men and he will dwell with them and they shall be his people and himself shall be with them and be their
and shall wipe away all tears from their eyes and there shall be no more death neither sorrow nor crying neither shall there be any more pain for the former things are passed away
revelation
i f t he this is the description of the planet of the where all the people that we will save from the final will live with us while waiting to be on earth when it will be habitable again in order to recreate a peaceful civilization
this is the outcome with which humanity is faced if it does not reach a level of wisdom as high as its level of technology
all this was seen by a primitive because john was a primitive compared to us as was as was as well as were all the prophets compared to our level before we gave them a sufficient initiation so that they could foresee what was a certain mastery of matter
your most advanced scientists are also primitive compared to what we can achieve today the same as the of the are compared to the scientists at cape
this is unfortunately what awaits humanity with a per cent probability of occurring
so that all of you who recognize us as your creators and who recognize as our last messenger on earth all of you must wrestle to ensure that humanity reaches out to this one little chance of survival by revealing our messages to the whole of mankind
if this is what you are doing you can live in peace and all the while try to expand and fulfill yourselves even more for if you are among the just who are doing everything within their power so that the truth and may finally triumph you can rest assured that we will save you from the final if it should ever happen
strive for love strive for fraternity strive for intelligence but do not despair if you see that the great majority of men remain violent aggressive and stupid
whichever way you look at it your efforts will be rewarded
either humanity will develop an interplanetary consciousness and the whole of mankind will enter the golden age or everything will explode and you will be those who we will save to rebuild everything
i the and the he who was the first one on earth and also he who will be the last i am sending this message to all humans of the earth through the words of my prophet to all those humans whom we have created and whom we have tried to t he n r f y to t he en o f t he e lead towards the golden age and who we love as if they were our own children
peace on earth to all men of and to all those who have the will to be happy
our inheritance is ready let us hope that the child will not die at its your move an religion angels without wings an angel from heaven contacted me
he said that i was the of the apocalypse and told me to go and the earth and to create the church of which i would be the pope and i the prophet of this religion
those people who know me would probably say in reading these words it now he has become irrational the immensity of his task has caused a serious psychological disorder and he is betraying the cause
this introduction could be interpreted at first as a being with wings coming from the sky contacted me
he told me that i was a divine being sent to announce the end of the world and that i should set out to preach the gospel all over the earth and to build a church with stones and cement of which i would be the pope with a and the sitting on a throne and i the prophet of this religion affiliated to i was going to announce what is going to happen in the centuries a n r a w w now let us try to find the true hidden meaning of the words contained in this sentence
as we have done for the words and apocalypse we must first of all search the or true meaning of each important word
while we are at it let us start with the of the word that is to say its original meaning from the which means true and which means science
the science of that word which is true or the science of the truth
what could be more natural for people who are gathered around the book which tells the truth than to be seekers of the truth was wrongly translated by the word god since it really meant those who came from the sky in and apocalypse was translated by the end of the world and all the while it meant revelation as we are all now aware
so let us take the words one by one in this apparently mystical introduction
an angel from the sky contacted me
let us look it up in the dictionary angel from the means messenger
that alone changes the whole meaning
we can a messenger from the sky contacted me
the supernatural becomes understandable
lets continue he told me that i was the of the apocalypse
from the means by the lord or sacred chosen by the lord
lets first look at the word lord to better understand the word
one discovers that the word lord in comes from the senior meaning the oldest
according to the vocabulary of the the lord i f t he was a person who ruled over a province
the god in whom the would make us believe is eternal is obviously the oldest thus the lord ruling the earth
through time the word was transformed and the religion adopted my lord in equivalent to the word
when the revolution came in removing all the lords unfortunately it spared those within the religion which is why within it we still address bishops
as my lord or
so then means chosen by god and as we know god is a bad translation of the word which means those who came from the sky so we can therefore say that in fact means the one chosen by those who came from the sky
as we have already seen apocalypse from the means revelation and so we can write clearly he told me that i had been chosen by those who came from the sky for the revelation
its all clear
but lets continue  to go and the earth
is from the word which means good news
then we can read  to go and spread the good news on earth  to create a church
church in in which means assembly
then it becomes a n r a w w to create an assembly
then it is written  of which i would be the pope and pope from the means father and from the means to link like a bridge links two shores or two places on the earth or one planet to another planet
we can thus clearly read  of which i will be the father and the liaison person between the planet of our creators and the earth
and lastly i the prophet of this religion
prophet from the means the one who reveals
religion from the means that which links or the tie which unites the creators to their creation
from the which means universal
therefore the end of the sentence means i the one whose mission is to reveal the universal tie which unites man and his creators
lets put all the pieces together and we read a messenger from the sky contacted me
he told me that i had been chosen by those who came from the sky for the revelation to go and spread the good news on earth to create an assembly i f t he of which i would be the father and the between the planet of our creators and earth i the one whose mission is to reveal the universal tie which unites men and their creators
if you take the mysticism out of the words then the sentence becomes rationally understandable for everyone
and yet the sentence at the beginning of this chapter had exactly the same meaning
in the mind of a mystical primitive as shown our example demonstrates clearly how easy it is to change the true sense of a sentence if the precise meaning of the words is not thus it becomes clear that the movement is a religion it ties the creators of humanity with their creation even if it is in fact an religion in the sense that it does not believe in the existence of a god from the which means denying the existence of any form of divinity
many people say that the practice of a cult defines the character of a religion
what is a cult derived from the meaning tribute rendered to a god but we would then say tribute rendered to the creators since is a
the contact on mornings at the obligation of thinking at least once a day about the book
the obligation of inviting the regional guide at least once a year to ones table so that he can talk about the messages the monthly meeting with the regional guide the annual meeting on the of august to celebrate the entry into the age of apocalypse all of those ceremonies could be qualified as a cult for each one of them is designed to pay tribute to our creators at regular intervals alone or in groups
even if the do not believe in a god they still recognize as a messenger sent by our creators just as they do and all the other great prophets who have lived on this earth and await their return in the company of the as the scriptures have predicted
the believes in the deeper meaning of the scriptures more particularly the biblical a n r a w w genesis but also in the and many other religious books all their writings being stripped of their mystical meaning by the messages of the
therefore the ignores the human laws which have been to the religious writings these laws having been made by men so as to enforce respect for governments and laws which were purely human
the tribute which we render to the could be called a cult why not the cult in itself is not wrong so long as it is not performed by people who think of the as being divinities but rather by people who love them sincerely for the extraordinary act of love which they have accomplished in giving us life and in leaving us free to progress by ourselves until such a time as we would be equal to there is no need to kneel down or to lie down with your face in the dirt under the stars but rather look up at the sky standing tall proud of being conscious of the privilege of living in this day and age when we are able to understand and show love for our creators to love them for the fantastic potential they gave us to create life by mastering and transforming minute particles of matter at our level to raise towards the galaxies a forehead full of love and hope the hope to one day meet those to whom we owe our existence and the fact to be able to understand why we are here and what our mission is in the infinite of space and time
until recently humanity was worshipping the creators who had created each man with the ability to understand the creators so now man must understand the creators so as to be able to love them even if mankind uses science negatively and a fatal nuclear occurs all those people who will have worked to prevent this catastrophe by trying to make mankind aware of its errors in the name of the those people shall be saved by our creators
those people who have faith in our fathers will be rewarded by the who have already provided access to eternal life on their planet where all the great prophets sent to earth to awaken i f t he humanity are presently living
the word faith comes from the and means commitment link
so it is therefore possible to not believe without understanding while at the same time giving your trust to the having faith in them because those who have the intelligence to have faith in them will be rewarded regardless
while trying to prevent humanity from committing the irrevocable error a has faith in the because he knows that they will not forget him in the event of a fatal
if there had been a newspaper in years ago it would have reported on the unemployment the energy crisis due to a shortage of slaves and also of the ever increasing cost of living due to the exorbitant taxes
these headlines would have fed the of all the newspapers if they existed and would have fed all the conversations
then there would have been a few lines written by the official scientists of the day or an editor seeking recognition on this false prophet claiming to be the king of the and it would be suggested to the authorities that this man be arrested immediately because he is dragging a of credulous people his followers around with him
one should not abuse the credulity in this way  so this illuminated person is then arrested tried and sentenced to death
this man who had dedicated his life to spreading the messages of our creators will be found crucified between two bandits
what crime had he committed unlawful practice of the truth reserved only for the representatives of the officially registered religions those which had been in existence for at least two or three hundred years you could call it a sort of controlled
a n r but the chief priests and elders persuaded the multitudes that they should ask for and destroy
 the high priests of the official religions and the news media convince the masses that a religion has to be a few thousand years old in order to be acceptable and so all the others are nothing more than dangerous sects
all of those people stand between man and the truth by allowing man to believe in the religion of the high priests of the state those scientists who claim that man comes from the monkey but who on the other hand their children and place a cross on the grave of their parents
they also obstruct the truth by allowing man to believe in the religion of traditions which permit the great fundamentals of our rotting society to survive a few years longer which promote and protect the family as a taxpayer as a stagnant closed system and a of personalities which uphold the nation which feeds the political men who are capable of doing anything to continue to get their pay
the military also do exactly the same thing as do finally all the low paid government employees who have been taught not to feel responsible for their own actions and who think they are protecting society when they condemn torture or even kill someone
these are the religions that governments endorse but by the same token they try to eliminate the ones that could make the young generation with joy when it discovers the truth which could get them to think of destroying the outdated primitive structures and replacing them by newer ones much more adaptable to the technological world in which we live
the top priority of all those people who wish to manipulate the population is to take away human responsibility it is called maximum
they are well aware as to why it should be so
they know that a soldier will not kill someone else unless he is totally convinced that he is doing it for a cause that same way that this soldier will not torture a prisoner unless he has been i f t he convinced that this will help a great cause
they also know that a citizen will oppose paying higher taxes unless he is told that it is to help the farmers or victims of drought
people will do anything for a great cause
the art of governing is to convince people of the greatness of their country
scientists have recently conducted a conclusive experiment in the field of responsibility
they hired actors who would pretend to be subjects in an experiment on the potential of human violence
then through classified ads they recruited people willing to participate in an experiment to explore the possibilities of the human brain
the people were placed one at a time at a desk equipped with different levers which were supposed to send electrical charges to a in which actors pretend to receive the charge
there were thirty levers in all which could supposedly each send out a charge of volts and so altogether could send charges of to volts
they were placed from left to right and indicated whether the electric charge would be light moderately strong or very strong
on the other hand the actor could see the lights light up on the panel in front of him showing the intensity of the shock he was supposed to have received from the electric chair to which he was tied and he could therefore act accordingly
if the shock was light he would simulate a light reaction if it was moderate he would jump a little more and give out a little cry then he would protest by saying that he did not wish to continue the experiment if the intensity was increased he would scream and beg to be released and finally when the maximum voltage of volts was reached he would pretend to collapse
the shocks were sent to the actors by those people who had been recruited in classified ads
however the recruits did not realize that they were actors and thought that they were sending real shocks to real people
the actor was asked a simple question by a scientist and when he answered the classified ads recruits were to let them know by giving them an electrical shock
this same scientist was urging the to increase the voltage consistently without listening to the of the receiver saying to the that this experiment a n r would help science to progress immensely and therefore all of this experiment in which the observer was really the one being observed was repeated many times so that statistics could be established to know how many people would go as far as killing other people in the name of scientific progress
it was also conducted in many countries so that the results could be compared and analyzed
contrary to the expectations of the scientists who had put together this experiment and the psychologists whom they had consulted it was not just a minority of people who were unbalanced enough to go as far as pushing the lever
in the us per cent of the people obeyed the scientist who told them not to listen to the cries of those whom they were and continued to administer shocks even when those being shocked could no longer say anything which itself counted as an incorrect answer and this three times in a row after which a new was selected
this experiment was also conducted in many countries where over per cent of the people went as far as the maximum voltage
the record high was reached in where per cent of the people would have been responsible for homicide by  the conclusion of professor of the department of psychology at university is as follows when the individuals are placed in a position of control the mechanisms which ordinarily assure the regulation of the individuals actions cease functioning and his actions become controlled by the people occupying the senior position  the disappearance of the sense of responsibility is the greatest consequence of submission to authority  most of the subjects place their behavior in a large context of undertakings useful to society the research of scientific truth
a laboratory of psychology could clearly claim to this legitimacy and so inspire confidence in those who were invited to work
i f t he an act such as the of a victim which seems bad when considered on its own takes on a completely different meaning when placed in this environment
morality does not disappear but it is focused in a radically different way the subordinate person experiences shame and pride depending on his good or bad execution of the act commanded by the authority
language offers a great number of terms to designate this type of moral loyalty sense of duty discipline  such is without doubt the fundamental lesson of our study the ordinary people by simply doing their job and without any particular hostility on their part could become agents in a terribly destructive process
moreover even when the destructive effects of their work become absolutely evident and one asks them to execute actions incompatible with the fundamental norms of morality relatively few people have the interior resources needed to resist authority
it is a mortal fault which seems to be natural in most people and which in the long run leaves our species with only a mediocre chance of survival
its quite clear
now we can understand why was crucified why millions of people died at the hands of the during religious or civil wars and in the
it becomes easier to understand how an honest or banker could have been a or burn witches or become an soldier sending women and children to the death chambers
they all thought they were doing something for the good of humanity
the first ones were getting rid of an illuminated man who wanted to overthrow their traditions and others felt that people who lived differently were surely responsible for the bad crops or the plague or even the a n r economic crisis
the fact that ideas so stupid could germinate in the brains of retarded people is
what is not is that governments could use the masses by utilizing such monstrous ideas to motivate them and give them reasons to act
the leaders in acted along this same principle
they forced their officers into under the pretense of obtaining information useful to their country
those officers who did the even considered that they were sacrificing themselves by acting this way bravely in the best interests of their men of the earth be very vigilant and do not accomplish the slightest action without asking yourself whether it is in contradiction to your deep sense of respect for the human being
refuse any hierarchy implying a suppression of your responsibility for the actions you carry out
every war criminal while on trial defended himself in good faith by claiming that he was only following orders
the man who launched the bomb on was only following orders
in every powerful country there are people who are ready to launch nuclear missiles in good faith and with a clear conscience knowing that they are only doing their duty in executing the orders received
they are responsible for their actions in every part of men women and children were tortured because people were following orders and according to them the only man responsible for all of this would be
it would be much too easy if it were so for example there are hundreds of nuclear missiles ready to be launched from and destined for other countries where thousands of women and children are living and if the massacre happened would the only man held to be responsible for it be the president of the republic of course not each man holding the power to kill others is personally responsible for the utilization of this power
the man who lights the furnace where children lie is more responsible than the one who has given the order in the first place just as the man who delivers a bomb on a city is more responsible than the one who made the decision
i f t he each person is totally responsible for his actions and can never hide behind the excuse that he was only following the orders which had been given to him by his superiors
if tomorrow i were to ask anyone of you to kill someone so that our movement may progress faster you must not do it
better still if an were to ask you to kill another man you should refuse to do it for it would probably be who would be trying to prove to the that all men are fundamentally bad
all your actions should be based on a deep feeling of respect for the life of others their ideas and their tastes
we fight ideologies without ever using violent physical actions towards those who do not agree awaken the people around you show them how to become respectful of other people and how to refuse whose most dangerous is the armed forces
remember per cent in and per cent in the
you must use all your energy so that tomorrow there is only per cent of people who would agree to perform violent actions ordered by a political and military hierarchy
those who killed did it in all serenity
they were not responsible they were only following orders
himself refused to endorse the responsibility for this crime and he washed his hands of the whole mess
he allowed the fanatics conditioned by the just like the to
if we were to ask all those people if they feel responsible none of them probably would
they would all wash their hands like the did
the would claim that they followed the law and a chief the fanatics as well and so perhaps we could hold one person responsible even though the whole of the population were the ones who committed the crime the crime of not intervening to prevent the assassination of an innocent those who sent the first to the lions den were also only following orders
those who burnt the witches those who the as well as the at were also only following orders as was the pilot of the plane carrying the bomb over a n r or the helicopter pilots who burnt the villages in we all have a choice at every moment of our lives remain responsible for our actions or become an irresponsible person
but the irresponsible are still responsible for their actions and will one day have to account for them for they are all committing crimes against humanity
learn this by heart if you must but refuse to obey a hierarchy which seeks to make you perform an action to which you would not like to be held responsible
the armed forces are the most dangerous example
it would be much better to die for having refused to kill than to kill under the pretext of obeying orders
he who these monstrous orders is in fact more responsible than he who has given them
no cause would justify the imposition of pain on others
if the survival of humanity depended upon the pain inflicted on one man a single nonviolent man then it would be better to let humanity perish
even more so if it means the survival of ones country or rather a frontier arbitrarily traced on a globe which belongs to all absolute respect for this principle is the only way to prevent the imperceptible slipping of humanity towards of individuals
the following sentence should be in our minds i am totally responsible for everything i do to others even if i am ordered to do so
no cause could ever justify inflicting pain or death on a nonviolent person and even if the survival of humanity depended on it this would not justify an exception
this is the second sentence which must be in our minds
it is evident of course that this rule does not apply in the case of legitimate which is explained in the messages and which permits the possible overpowering even by force of one who tries to use violence against your person or your loved ones
if a military man was threatening the destruction of humanity with nuclear missiles it i f t he would then be justifiable to him by force and even to execute him if there were no other means available
violence could only be applied to those who threaten humanity with violence while attempting to disarm them and render them powerless
there is however a very good way to control those people who have the power when obeying orders to launch nuclear missiles capable of destroying cities in a few seconds
their identity should be made known on a precise list and they should be made aware that in the case of the utilization of any such missiles they would be judged along with those who gave the orders
this is what we are trying to do with criminals today but if such a list had existed with similar dispositions before many people would have thought twice before their innocent victims
nonviolent civilians should have the right to place neutral observers among the military forces to note down the identities of those who carry out cruel acts using the excuse that they were obeying orders so that inhuman missions are not carried out solely on the pretext that the order has been given
there is policing of the police but there is no policing of the armies
they are free to command knowing full well that while at war a soldier could be shot to death for refusing to obey an order
until the earth gets rid of the armies and the wars the neutral observers would oppose the execution of soldiers who have refused orders that could qualify as crimes against humanity
the un could impose these observers on all the armies of the world and then a military man could not be sentenced until his disobedience is judged by a council of these observers to investigate if the order which he refused to obey could have constituted a crime against humanity
because it is in this way that people are forced to execute orders of which they disapprove they are afraid of being punished if they obey
they prefer to kill innocent people or to torture them rather than be imprisoned or killed themselves
refuse to bend to authority be the real heroes of humanity by preferring to be imprisoned or killed yourselves rather than laying into innocent people
when you have motivated millions of people so that they act in this way those a n r giving the orders will see an army of people refusing to carry out the crimes which they ordered and then it will be time to punish those who dare give such orders hoping they will be listened to
men have had enough energy to refuse work like before where the bosses exploited humans like cattle even if it meant death for many of them at the hands of a policeman of the law
it is possible to find the same energy to fight the last form of tyranny imposed on the inhabitants of this world militarism
many people with powers and honors are disturbed by what i have to say
unfortunately for them they are too late in noticing my presence
if i was worried in the first two years of my mission i am now no longer worried
in the beginning if i had been sent to jail i could not have carried out my mission on earth
fortunately the powers at hand smiled when they saw this young man who spoke of and with pink antennae  now they understand that the contents of the messages from our creators are revolutionary questioning and everything which they have used to gain power religion politics the armed forces work the family the country
so now they are trying to stop me by using their justice as they used it against my brother
there is always a justice to justify the worst injustices
the first were sentenced by official tribunals the same for the burning of witches or the sending of people to extermination camps or the soviet to psychiatric hospitals or labor camps all those people were they were upsetting because they refused to be normal and conform
unfortunately they have up too late
even if i were put in one of their prisons there would still be thousands of messengers like you in many countries of the world to carry the messages of our creators
i am no longer alone i am of you
i would then enter their cell with a smile thinking of you who around the world will be other working together so that the embassy can be built so that humanity enters the golden i f t he in my dungeon i would feel the happiness of someone who has fulfilled his mission that for which he has been created and even though he has been put out of action everything he has started continues to advance without him
also hoping that my father who art in heaven will realize that i am no longer needed on this earth and that he will allow me to join my brothers the prophets on the planet of the
this thought alone is sufficient to make me want to sing the glory of our fathers to say again the words that men have been repeating without being able to understand which means praised be in
yes praised be who has given me the strength to carry out my mission until the end
my brothers i am now relaying to you the torch so that you can accomplish your mission
even if the time when the truth will be triumphant is not here yet you can rest assured that it is not very far and you will have the opportunity to live it
it is written in the this generation will not pass that everything shall be revealed
these words are addressed to those who will have the opportunity to live this age of apocalypse which we entered in
you are this generation either you will know the golden age on earth because of your efforts which have contributed to world peace and the awakening of mankind or humanity will destroy itself and you will know the golden age amongst the great prophets who are already on the planet of the
the are counting on each and every one of you to shed the light
my last word will again be an etymological amen which means in so be it and to those of you who are reading this book without having complete knowledge of the messages from our creators be sure to read the other books as soon as possible and then join us in making humanity aware of them and in building the residence in which the will officially contact the governments of the earth where they will come in the company of the great prophets and others as the scriptures have announced
a n r then write to me
i will personally answer your letter and indicate when and where you can have your cellular plan transmitted your first action which recognizes the as our creators the name and address of your regional guide and the dates when the next courses of awakening will be held which could make you a guide an efficient messenger of our atheistic religion of the infinite of and of love for humanity
take your pen
be the spectator of your life anymore become actors on the stage of this sad grey and resigned everyday life that is yours to enlighten it with a thousand shimmering colors of absolute consciousness
take a pen and paper and write to me very simply and modestly with your everyday words tell me if the discovery of the truth has been a shock for you
follow the impulse which came up inside of you and which said ah its not bad but what will i be able to change i am only one person and then what will the neighbors say hide your head in the sand come out of the fragile shell that society has given you so freely your head is already sticking out and it feels but you are afraid that this will only be another illusion a very pleasure which would only bring you problems afterwards
untrue live out completely the fantastic exaltation which you have felt
you will enter a new world in which you will meet hundreds of people like you who have read the messages in only one night and who like you have hesitated in getting involved in the diffusion of the messages
these people will help you by explaining how they have progressed and you will find yourself filled with happiness while seeing yourself through them and while talking freely about your anxieties without the worry of being made a fool since you are assured that the people around you share your conception of the universe the conception that you had within you although you never expressed your thoughts for fear of being ridiculed
one of our guides once said one does not become a one discovers that one always has been when one discovers the messages
i f t he if you have discovered that you are a then i am waiting for your letter and the are waiting for you to drop it in the mailbox my address is international movement case
or me at headquartersraelorg
commentaries and testimonials of through the eyes of science chemical engineer guide evolution and the myth many of us were taught the theory of evolution at school and even suffered its influence which permeated from our history lessons to philosophy and even religion
to quote we have been saturated and conditioned with this idea  we learned this on school benches by repeating fashion that life evolved and that organisms transformed themselves into others
unfortunately even those who go to school and undergo this learning process or those that did but understand the theory still believe in it more than those who did
in the end this continual indoctrination generation after generation must inevitably bias our minds especially since the enormous quantities of evidence against it is never presented to the pupils
how many people would have the courage to be seen as heretics if they dared question evolution when so many well known scientists professors and clergy state it as fact this is a big problem especially for those who following a scientific career but luckily for them some clear sighted minds do i f t he exist within the scientific community such as the above mentioned eminent biologist
in his book evolution written in he wrote  are we really as sure as would certainly be the wish of the that the problem of evolution is really solved the mutations that we are familiar with and which they wish to consider responsible for the coming to being of the whole of life on earth are not more than organic deprivations deficiencies and losses of pigments or or doubling of organs
in any case they never bring anything really new and original to the organic layout and nothing that we believe might be the beginning of a new organ or the start of a new function
no decidedly i can not admit that these mistakes of heredity could build the whole of the living world in all its richness its structural delicacies and astonishing adaptations even with the competitive factor of natural selection and the help of immense many experiments have been designed in the last decade to understand the mechanisms of mutations and again the same conclusions are reached
one of the pioneers in this field of study was prize winner hj
who concentrated particularly on the common fruit fly
he concluded that it is so rare that a allows survival that we can consider them as
almost all mutations including both those occurring in the wild and those provoked in the laboratory result in hereditary illnesses of survival value and genetic
the plan of living organisms is extremely complex and any modification will inevitably result in its disorganization
in the laboratory we have been able to cause hens necks and even whole bodies to have no feathers or to change the color of insects eyes wings
we have even slightly altered other t r r t t he e yes o f organs but in the natural environment not one was advantageous to ensure its survival
an accident of this sort can never increase organization but will result only in damage in the same way as throwing a watch on the ground can never increase its precision nor can hitting a computer with a endow it with extra calculating properties
and the time factor will not change anything since what was impossible yesterday will also be impossible today
the itself always stays within the confines of the species
for example among the innumerable mutations provoked in not one produced a different species or anything different from its ancestors
the flies size color and morphology may vary but not even a series of mutations has ever produced a new organism with attributes that never existed before
living cells are composed of extremely complex molecules themselves made up of many combinations of atoms so how is it possible that these delicate structures spontaneously form their constituent parts randomly scattered around inanimate matter seek to complicate itself but on the contrary tends towards disorganization and stability
it is no use saying that it will happen someday since with time comes decomposition and disintegration
the tendency that every organic structure has to revert to disorganization is out in the thermodynamic law which defines the function of entropy
there is never a gain in order without the intervention of an outside force
therefore inanimate matter containing no energy or movement will always stay inert in the absence of any guiding hand to organize and direct it
thus the theory of evolution lies in direct contradiction with the law of the methods that have been used for building the theory of evolution are totally unscientific and will continue to be so for as long as the consider objectively the evidence and continue to force the facts
true advances will happen only when glory seeking petty arguing fear of reputation and disappear to allow honest i f t he conclusions to be made based on solid facts instead of preconceived life on earth is not the result of random chance but is the fruit of outside intervention of the our creators
a new hypothesis for the history of humanity when the the central intelligence agency of gave the institute the task of studying the world distribution of natural resources such as gas and coal professor who was put in charge discovered a rather strange phenomenon
he put together the continents as they would have been at the end of the geological tertiary period before they split up and found that all the main oil springs such as those in the and the asphalt sands of the of and the heavy oils of south and all formed a circle
present studies on reveal that it is the result of what used to be living organisms such as plants animals
which have in anaerobic conditions that is to say in the absence of air where special bacteria reduce and transform their proteins and fats
dead trees are the main source of these proteins and fats but what usually happens when one of them dies is that normal bacteria decompose it and it into the forest food chain without producing so for the above to occur the trees must be buried straight away to prevent access of air
but when oil fields are examined one finds that they are extremely deep meters deep in northern and cover considerable areas in the so the actual volume of material which must have been brutally buried all in one go was no theory up to now can account for these facts satisfactorily but we hold the key to this enigma
t r r t t he e yes o f when the decided to destroy their bases their laboratories and all that they had created on earth they must have used extremely powerful methods of destruction which as well as breaking up this original continent and sending each respective fragment drifting from the centre of the shock must also have swept the whole land surface
since the impact must have spread from the bombs point of impact all the living matter including immense forests animals and even man would have been buried deep immediately and all together under tons of earth in a ring shape circling the central explosion
this would explain how extremely large volumes of living matter were buried quickly enough to provide anaerobic conditions in the large circular formation which intrigued so much when he back together again all the fragments of what was once our unique single continent
during the time when the built the first continent until they broke it up erosion would have accumulated sediment rich in animal matter such as and shells into the oceans especially around the edge of the continent
as what later became the north and south continental plates scraped along the ocean bed all the sediment built up to form the and the rocky mountain the same for the subcontinent which broke off from and sliding northeast trapped in its path enormous amounts of material which we now know as the
the continent drifting south became covered with a huge coating of ice preserving until today traces of tropical vegetation
meanwhile part of and went southeast accumulating along its edge sediment which was to form the great dividing range
the destruction was cataclysmic and provoked not only large geological changes but also ones innumerable life forms them under layers of sand lime earth and a sort of muddy ice which preserved them until this day and from which i f t he they periodically emerged released from their frozen coffin of the greater north
only a small handful of humans were protected in the during the flood
upon their return they found the continent completely unrecognizable and by the destruction the geological having resulted in parts of the surface being and the appearance of cracks in the crust layer causing volcanic it is easy to see how the story of the unique continent breaking up into many fragments where there was once land but now is water and vice versa became distorted into the legends of or where a continent is reputed to have disappeared into the sea
in fact it did not sink it merely moved aside
not all the living organisms were recreated after the flood some considered to be monstrous and detrimental to the ecological balance such as the large and dinosaurs were left out which explains the sudden and simultaneous disappearance of these beasts
after the flood the with the humans of earth and the traces of their presence which we can still find scattered all over the world are post
let us learn to open our eyes we have everything around us to enable us to understand
we are in the age of the apocalypse the age when we can once again hope to meet our creators the
transmission of the cellular plan in the light of science so far today spectral studies investigating the relationship between matter and energy have allowed us to achieve a certain understanding of the structure and makeup of molecules
although matter may appear to our human eyes to be homogeneous be it in gaseous liquid or solid state it is in fact made up of many building blocks called molecules which themselves are composed of atoms
t r r t t he e yes o f an atom can be compared to a miniature solar system with a positive nucleus in the middle around which electrons rotate each capable of spinning on themselves just as the earth does on its journey around the sun
the electrons movement is described by four quantum numbers principle secondary magnetic and spin
wave mechanics associated a particular vibration to all moving particles the motion of which can be predicted by an atom can only emit or absorb energy of particular frequencies
this is accompanied by a spectrum of separate and distinct radiations which are related directly to the energy state of the atom
therefore every type of atom has its own specific type of atomic spectrum
the nuclear magnetic resonance can also provide detailed information on the nature of the bond holding the atoms together forming the molecule
within the molecule the atoms will also relative to each other
if there are only two there is only one fundamental frequency following the joining at the two centers of gravity of the two nuclei and it is therefore linear
molecules composed of more atoms will have a larger number of fundamentals
atoms can also rotate around their own axes
their and energies can vary only in a discontinuous way
the jump from one energy level to another is done either by absorbing or emitting energy
every chemical reaction is based on such energy changes and the emission resulting from these matter can be measured and recorded as and molecular
every molecule of our body is vibrating in such a way and is therefore emitting a whole host of which at first sight might appear to be a huge cacophony
thus the human body is an electric and wave today our technology does not yet allow us to record such phenomena on an organism as complex as the human being
neither are our methods of analysis fine enough to distinguish the emission i f t he coming from a particular molecule and that of the background noise but with time  remember that discovered the waves which are named after him only in the and nuclear magnetic resonance has been known only since so where will we be in or in years let us not forget that the are years in advance the principle of baptism the transmission of ones cellular plan is today understandable to us and this ceremony is scientifically explained as follows every individual has a cellular plan specific to him which with its own spectral emission
a guide whose own frequency has been noted by the during his or her initiation can act as a relay between the new and the satellite which records every humans water is used between the new forehead and the guides hands so as to establish a good electrical contact and the baptism indicates to the that the has both understood the messages and lives by them
it is an act of recognition
impressions of a priest victor priest i was in on holiday when i learned of the messages given by the to
i had already visited and since when i laid hands on the first message the book which tells the truth on and a few days later on i picked up the took me to their planet
i found the first book in and the second one in in
t r i o f a p words could hardly describe what i felt while reading these two messages surprise mixed with admiration and fear a shock of joy this is a very poor description
i was transported with joy into a state of wellbeing or an indescribable euphoria and a profound sense of peace with a new outlook
no a renewed outlook on everything
if the word resentment from the word also meaning to feel again did not have this sense i would use it to explain the various feelings which i was living so intensely
two days before my departure from i had visited a musician friend of mine who had asked me to bring back the book which tells the truth as he could not find it in since he did not know who the editor was
he made me listen to a recorded interview which the international had released in and which had been transmitted several times during the season
i had only a vague idea of the messages then and to please my friend i had promised to bring him back this book
before his waiting period was rewarded on my return on the following it was i who had been rewarded and beyond all my expectations it was as if i had discovered a precious pearl without having really looked for it i am speaking of course of what the messages contained
it was only upon my return that i had started to investigate this message intelligently if i may say so a little at random i tried to understand the essence of the messages
i looked at the biblical writings which i had studied in theology on my way to then in the was unfamiliar to me except for a few words which i had learned in theology also in the history of religions particularly in the history of and finally in the scientific field
i formed my opinion based on this research
what was it that struck me most in these messages what impressed me the most without too many comments i will outline the strong points in a synthesis of my impressions although these points should be discussed at greater length the original written in speaks of which means literally those who came from the sky
is a word i f t he which has been translated by the word god in current bibles
so there is no immaterial supernatural or god but there are constantly present in the and who among other things have created life in a laboratory including human life through inert chemicals associated with
therefore the or are clearly present at different for different civilizations
thus we are far from this conception which says the and the should not be mixed
there is no soul which leaves the body after death but there is the genetic code which is the principle of life
the title of the first message was announced in in revelation and in but i will reveal to you that which is written in the book of truth
and and thou keep secret these words and seal the book until the time of the end
many will look here and there and knowledge will increase
the notion of the infinitely great and the infinitely small the awakening of the mind to the infinite is where truth resides
evolution by chance or successive random events is a myth
on the contrary evolution resides first in the minds of our creators
no one can belong to someone else you can not be owned by someone whatever the relationship be it in work marriage or any other situation
the affirmation and development of basic human objectives which each one of us is called upon to follow in his or her life is think create and expand the solutions proposed to solve the great problems of humanity among other things selective democracy or which would apply to the genius being the raw material of humanity the procedure to follow to create a world government the creation of robots to abolish manual labor a unique world currency until money is suppressed totally a universal second language each region conserving its the abolition of military service and the placing of career soldiers at the service of t r i o f a p world peace we can not continue to search for peace and security at the same time as of said in chapter of his first to the
the perfect meeting of science and religion in our epoch the age of apocalypse or revelation where the two blend so perfectly all the religious writings notably the have announced the return of the great prophets nearly in all in the company of our creators the
when i had finished reading these first two messages i felt vividly inside me the hypocrisy of who pray only from their lips while the precept of loving their neighbors is almost always forgotten
i felt this temporal and spiritual domination of the church by the money and the riches which it has accumulated
this domination is maintained and encouraged by the political powers which see only advantages in it i felt this mystification which only makes people dormant we are far from the vigilance recommended by to read the signs of the time and recognize them when they happen but it is the cult of the traditions which has made people blind
i remember those words from the book of do not say how is it that the past is better than the present for it is not wise to pose such a question
to me it felt that this guilt of conscience was accentuated by the idea that man is a sinner that man is imperfect explained by this rejection of intelligence ie
man is told to believe without understanding and maintained by the idea that sexual pleasure or even sensuality is contemptible
i have linked the signs of the time announced in the religious writings with our epoch where we see them happen
this epoch is ours the age of the apocalypse or the age of the revelation when everything can be understood
the signs of the time reveal the original mystery in the light of scientific progress
anyone who searches in the in particular and compares the predictions with the achievements of our scientific age and understands only that which is the foundation of the earth and that which has been kept hidden since the foundation of the world
i f t he allow me to some of these signs with their accomplishments man will be equal to the creators of life the deaf will hear the blind will see the crippled will regain the use of their limbs electronic man will have his voice carried to the four corners of the earth and the healing of poisoned people the healing of sick people by the imposition of the hands development of surgery the prolongation of life the people of find their country again the creation of the state of numerous signs in the sky thousands of false prophets trying to plunge mankind into fanaticism and mysticism religions and sects
even if the church does not recognize me as a priest since i have adhered to the movement i nevertheless remain a priest
i was entrusted with a fantastic mission the spreading of the messages to the greatest number of people possible i am still a priest since like i am the messenger of those in whom i have always believed the while only now understanding truly their work the creation of man and the mission of
i am still a priest but i am vigilant since i have opened my mind i have also become a mind opener and no longer the one who puts human consciences to sleep i am and i will remain a priest that is to say a guide for humanity on the path of peace and universal love
t r y  i a r yes  i am chemical engineer and guide yes i am a disciple of the religion of the infinity of time and space a child of the earth who has traces of our fathers of the stars and who is trying to make known to the rest of humanity this fabulous story of ours
unfortunately i believe that one does not become one day one discovers the messages and one finds an echo of ones own thoughts of ones own preoccupations
some day or another dizzy before the unfathomable of time and space we have all tried to the mystery of our origin and the uncertainty of our future
the messages have provided me with the answer to this preoccupation
of course for someone who had received a technical and scientific education certain passages in the messages do not appear very orthodox and not very consistent with traditional teachings
but let us apply the advice of and make all pass through the sieve and lodge nothing in our mind by mere authority and confidence
if we try to all the elements of the messages by critical analysis we are soon conscious that we are dealing with an extremely solid i have always had the intuition that there existed a link between all the more or less fabulous stories that come to us from ancient times and that there exists in each of them some gold in a jumble of nonsense  i started to research and i had the confirmation that the contacts with the had always existed
we have found traces in the myths and souvenirs of ancient civilizations mythology which relates a whole series of gods and giants of ancient times epic poem of with its two parts and the epic of i f t he of which reported that which happened at the beginning the and the of in and nearer to us the book of the and some physical traces can be seen on the plain of engravings at and certainly at island de and in many other places throughout the world
we have at our disposal all the pieces of the puzzle to reconstruct the story of our origin
in the reading of the messages i have certainly had occasion to pose some questions on the apparent contradictions which could have existed between certain cited facts and common knowledge
it appears that we make what we consider to be scientific achievements based on frail and hypotheses and i find insurmountable contradictions in scientific teachings
i have always thought that all the phenomena of nature susceptible of being understood in the universe are coherent and that they all depend on one another in a more or less complex fashion
the development of a more and more abstract mathematical tool has physics on a path which is strangely logical but outside of material realities
it is thus that postulated that the speed of light was an insurmountable limit of all speeds in the universe committing the monumental error of taking as principle that space is uniformly empty and identical to itself in every part of the cosmos apart from the stars and the planets
beyond the clouds which encircle our planet the density of the gaseous molecules diminish progressively with altitude until they attain a level which we call emptiness
but the interstellar emptiness is pervaded by waves of every kind infrared radio waves
so all implies the t r y  i a r existence of an environment which the interstellar space is not empty as appearances would have us believe but full of a substance capable of undulating a composed of infinitesimal particles compared with the size of the atoms we know
implies movement and movement energy
in a century where we believe that the equivalent of mass and energy is absolutely true it is not logical to deny the existence of a mass of interstellar and space
space is heterogeneous and the local characteristic of this space depends on the energetic gradient in the part under consideration
the earth and the solar system bathe in a diffuse energetic environment of particles whose pressure is responsible for what we call the forces of attraction
the gravitational space is comparable with a gaseous atmosphere similar to the aerial atmosphere
the speed of propagation of waves is a function of the local density and not a constant as the believe so all the cosmic distances must be recalculated
all the distances in light years calculated by the traditional methods are overestimated
the stars that surround us are much nearer than we believe
moreover the development of theories which confuse the dimensions of space and time are ridiculous
the factor of time which is parasitic to all the formulations and equations of physics is an arbitrary element
time has no existence in itself the notion that we have is subjective and it is derived from our own biological and mental organization
we project it in the exterior world draw an irresistible illusion of an absolute universal time
scientific time is conventional it is based on physical standards susceptible of being coordinated under different forms in an arbitrary way
our conception of the cosmos is fundamentally false together with our philosophic concepts
i find everywhere around me confirmation of the messages
it to open our eyes to understand this fabulous story of the i f t he coming of the to earth and scientific creation of life in laboratories which we ourselves will soon repeat
no doubt my background as a has made me familiar with the affinity existing between chemical elements and biological structures participating in the mechanisms of life
but even for an ordinary person with a curious mind the rapid reading of popular scientific reviews allows us to foresee the direction towards which the biochemical and medical research is going
become conscious that we have synthesized certain genes by combining that segments of molecules of had been implanted in the interior of bacteria that the transfer of genetic material from one organism to another is becoming increasingly familiar to us  look at the direction taken by the researchers of the last prize winners  the understanding of the molecular structure and the mechanisms which they control open up the possibility of regeneration of tissues and the replacement of organs and of the creation of new animal species and with time of the synthesis of humans in our image and the cycle starts again
the study of the mechanisms of the coding of information in the molecules of will lead us to understand and to utilize the memory substances in our brain substances that could be transferred from one individual to another
become aware of the biological revolution in progress and how the consequences of which will create a fundamental change in the whole of our social and political structures
wake up this is not
to be does not mean to be secluded in a group always staring at their belly buttons persuaded they have found the truth feeling superior in i know what the movement is for me just the opposite to a sect
our proceedings have an ambitious goal but they progress with humility being conscious that humanity is penalized by aggression pride vanity and egotism
t r y  i a r i love the philosophy of our existence developed by the movement because it seeks the complete expansion of individuals
it teaches us to listen to that which we have in the depths of ourselves and to reveal the best in us
life is everywhere in the universe but our life is unique and it is important to make a success of it life is a lost blessing if one has not lived as one wished to
i have found a through the study of the messages a better understanding of others and of myself and they have allowed me to become more conscious of our degree of solidarity
the philosophy of the movement is a philosophy of the love of life and of its creators a tolerant and philosophy which tends to remove guilt from sensuality and to disengage from all the taboos and inhibitions connected with sexuality
the adhesion of the movement is not a towards which i have always had a great distrust but a voluntary and enriching act which has brought me great pleasure by the personal that i obtained and the joy in the diffusion of the messages around me
i believe that we must not commit the error that which happened with of attributing more importance to the messenger than to the message
the essential thing is becoming conscious that the have always played a role in our history and wish nothing better than to renew that contact today
the past history of humanity shows us that each stage of its development necessitated an and renewing of fundamental beliefs in our scientific social philosophic and religious conceptions
unfortunately a new scientific truth does not usually impose itself by convincing its adversaries its triumph results by progressive extinction of its adversaries and the appearance of a new generation for whom this truth had always been familiar m
i believe that we should help people to stand on their own two feet and to get rid of the crutches that are the beliefs and religions we should seek to by raising the level of consciousness
for if over the centuries religion has asked and i f t he sometimes imposed on the faithful to believe the mysteries and the most fables today our history is understandable and it is up to us to open our eyes and minds to prepare our future
in the present is contained the beginnings of our future
humanity is at the eve of its birth and perhaps of its death and those who have not understood the meaning of the word apocalypse will nevertheless perhaps be right
we participate in the awakening of humanity and in the development of the cosmic consciousness
that is the direction of my involvement in this ambitious work which is the preparation of humanity for the welcoming of our creators the
the consecration of my priest and professor of catechism
i would like it to be known that i became interested in everything related to man and god at the very early age of years old
i saw them as two similarities man and god constituted from infinity and constituting infinity
i then became really interested in god and my relation to him
i was soon led to contemplation to mysticism as if i had been trying to escape this earth to reach the so i read asked questions and meditated
i undertook long years of study to go even deeper into the subject
i studied the humanities philosophy theology and finally because i had faith in man i still have faith and his intelligence
since i am a complete and total person i searched for a family where i could my whole life to this god whom i was forever questioning whom i looked for whom i materialized in meditation and contemplation this god with whom i had lengthy t r t he o f y p conversations as if he were an old friend
but i kept this part a secret because i could have been thought of as crazy
i found a religious community of fathers to which i devoted six years of my life as a student and pastor and i spent moments of discovery and formation within this community
but i soon became conscious of something which i found superficial
there was something which did not seem to satisfy my most profound aspirations
i enjoyed praying i still enjoy praying as the contact with my creators my source of infinity
i was thought to be mystical by many people but i saw the father of as being human just like when he said my father who art in heaven  my thought of there being more than one creator was then true
furthermore i had the and had come to the conclusion that was not god and i was impassioned by an aspect of theology the theologians of the death of god or theology of the death of god
in some way i was an but i was afraid of admitting this truth
i detected in these schools of theological thinking another form of mystification
i could not find complete satisfaction to my numerous questions on man and his faith on man in his religious and social involvement in this church that i found to be out of phase even false at times
nevertheless i worked in the midst of the church said to be of in the numerous movements which it includes all the while specializing in religious science to search even deeper
my studies impelled me to work within my environment to question it as well as shake it
i still felt misunderstood
this research which took me three more years led me to a sort of emptiness a sort of sadness
i could not tolerate so much mysticism so much blindness
i liked to study but i had reached the point where i could no longer feel a solid base
i felt that the slow process of reasoning used to justify some pastoral and ecclesiastical structures mysticism and was irrelevant out of phase and i was rejecting it more and more
those people who did not share my views i f t he thought of me as being critical and superficial
they accommodated themselves with banal ideas in their faith and in their religion and still do the same today
it was then that i decided to take a step backward for a year and search for the truth within my soul
i was still teaching but i did not get involved in any movements
i questioned and i felt that i was starting to see the light
on i attended a conference at the plateau auditorium in given by
on that night i really felt that my years of study had not been in vain
i understood many things among others that i had always been an deep down inside of me and that i was profoundly religious as well
i was interested in the matter i loved man prayer had kept me in constant communication with this group of our creators the who i more and more each day
i understood everything in a flash
i was happy i recognized in speaking in his own era
something happened to me awakened me enlightened me i felt drawn to him in minutes everything inside of me was reconstructed again everything was being connected everything was becoming harmonious again and it has never ceased since
i was enraptured and it showed
after all from his mouth i had heard a truth so simply so clearly and with such evidence this truth that i had searched for so many years the hard way
it was as if a mental block had been removed in an instant
i had gone to the lecture with some friends but as was confirmed later it had not triggered such a reaction in them
just the same they had noticed a change in me that night and they noticed it even more afterwards
it was as if the messages had provoked a click inside me but they would not admit to what they were seeing
i became silent happy and luminous
i could hear them trying to reject to destroy by mystical reasoning this beautiful simple and liberating truth which had become soft music to my ears this good news in all its plenitude in its entirety in its clearness
they rejected and his messages t r t he o f y p from the in the same way that people had tried to reject and his message
those few moments with had revealed the synthesis of more than years of research analysis commitment sufferings and the gift of myself
now i would be able to my whole being to the diffusion of this great news of this great liberation and this would happen through intelligence comprehension harmony and balancing of my shaken mind
it was not easy to cope with the reactions of my family my wife my friends my professional environment the church and my friends who were still priests
but i received a lot of help from so many awakened friends and by the guidance which i received while attending the mind and body awakening sessions
i look at all my years of studying as having been spent in a laboratory a direct preparation for life which i am presently leading as a guide in this magnificent movement in this strange but beautiful new religion this young religion
i feel that there has been a breaking off with things of the past because i am continuing what i had started as a child the understanding of the beginning of man the genesis to be able to walk in the light and build the present always to and always to and cream off the truth from some years of crust by deepening my understanding of the numerous theological philosophical and religious aspects of the messages given to by the creators of humanity the so as to live out the present and to look forward to a splendid future
that night i had been shaken by the messages so much so because i had felt them for so many years almost unconsciously
since then i have felt the messages in every part of my life even in the most hidden corners in my professional work as an educator in my family social and political life
they have turned all my beliefs but i had been ready for a long time
i had been waiting and i had even taught about this prophet of the
but i could not very well understand
then  suddenly everything became clear the messages awakened me they stared me in the face
all at once i could understand the and
i f t he i was so happy that such an event had happened that i trembled with joy
it was like an shower on a hot humid summers i met a few days after the conference for the first time
in one weekend i had read the two messages twice over
said to me you have everything within yourself to find the answers to your problems
once they will have been solved you will be per cent more efficient
your family problems are crushing you they are stopping you and you
now i know what he meant
i am so happy at having chosen the path of awareness and consciousness
since then i have read the messages many times over and becoming a guide was the consecration of my for which i had always been searching
i understood that i had not waited in vain and that i was continuing the true church the original church since i was going to follow the last of the great prophets of the age of apocalypse and i was going to work at the diffusion of the messages of the our creators going to work at this unity to which i had already dedicated my life since these messages announce the religion of the religions the religion of the infinite the religion of the intelligence of man and the eternity of matter
thus then is my end and my beginning
i am happy and i love
i was relieved of my duties as a specialist on religion
i am teaching and mathematics as my main subjects and religion and moral behavior as my second subjects
i never speak openly of the messages in my professional environment but people can feel them in my behavior and i am respected for it
the time is near when my colleagues will ask me about these messages i can just feel it i am sure of it
everywhere else i go i diffuse the messages by my presence and by my words
i have the church even though i am still convinced that there has been no breaking but rather a continuation of the truth
this and me
my entire life is dedicated to revealing to all men of good will this truth this message of love fraternity and peace this serenity this unique and revolutionary message for those who seek to t r t he o f y p understand it with the eyes of intelligence which our creators the have given us the eyes of wisdom created and infinite
to become active so as not to become radioactive former national guide for the here is my testimony where i will elaborate the profound and fundamental reasons which have led me to become a guide in the movement after i had given serious consideration to the implications brought about by my adhesion
the message given to by the implies a total reconsideration at all levels individual social political scientific philosophical and religious
this allows universal involvement in the building of society
but how did i come to these conclusions since the age of i have been interested in a wide range of topics and i tried to stay on top of whatever was going on as well as whatever had happened in the past when i reached a stage where i wondered about the evolution of humanity
and i like many people was questioning everything while dreaming of a perfect world
what did i discover and what were my hopes here they are synthesized the origins of life i was not satisfied with the theory of a divine creation although there seemed to be one constancy throughout the world all religions and mythologies speak of the creation of man by one or a number of gods who came from heaven
i then concluded that there had to be some truth in this first thought palpable and material which implied that man had come from somewhere other than earth
the theory of evolution which claims that man is the result of successive mutations i f t he starting from inorganic matter which resulted in the organic beings that we are seemed to have too many faults to be a truly valuable theory
moreover it is presently being seriously questioned by eminent scientists
i had noticed that since the beginning of time man lacked tolerance love respect and fraternity in his relationships with others
i wished that these shortcomings would be erased in human relations
throughout history the repeated failures of every type of government to solve the fundamental problems of humanity have forced me to think of a system which would allow the election of the best qualified people on earth who would be concerned only with improving our society
this would imply that they would not be paid by the political military or industrial trusts which have permitted a great number of deadly wars and an everlasting increase in weapons of destruction in the name of values such as the mother country work and family and the of man by man
i became conscious that humanity had reached a crucial epoch decisive in its evolution where mans future had become a gamble
the religions i felt that there existed at the base of all the religions a fundamental and accessible truth but also that the primitive and systems had used this truth to enslave men to absolute restriction
i also felt that this truth as revealed by the prophets had to come from beings who had reached a very high level of wisdom
i opposed the notion that man had to be guilty because of his carnal nature as i was against everyone who sought to diminish humans under the pretense that they would be greater after death in another t r to b a  dimension
i was convinced that man could reach a superior level of consciousness while remaining in complete harmony with his human this original curiosity which man has transformed into a systematic study of himself and the environment in which he lives has permitted humanity to push back the frontiers of the unexplained
i knew that the use of science to solve the problems with which our civilization is confronted is possible if science is used wisely
pollution overpopulation hunger the energy crisis all these problems could be solved by science in harmony with nature and it is imperative that this ideal be attained as soon as possible
i was equally conscious of the temporary aspect of our knowledge and that every theory is but a tentative interpretation of facts which themselves are undeniable
the unknown i was aware of everything which is unexplained on earth and which led us to believe that extraterrestrial intelligent beings intervened in the course of our history
all of this being quite natural for me knowing that one day we could explain everything
i was then conscious of the present state of things and my hopes for a better world and an evolution of humanity towards more harmony and more fraternity and i could not be satisfied in any existing organization whether it be religious political or social
i felt powerless and alone
it was then in that i learned of the messages that had entrusted to in which were contained in the book which tells the truth and in a second book written later after the encounter the took me to their planet
i was filled with joy in reading these two books in which were synthesized all my hopes of attaining this harmony this peace and this fraternity i f t he which has always been missing on this earth
the books also tell of the means used by our fathers to overcome the same problems with which we are faced
but like good fathers they are leaving us free to choose because they consider us as being individuals capable of i decided to become a guide so as to be able to communicate this hope to the world so that humanity is able to reach the golden age where man will be able to blossom totally
i did not want to remain a passive witness to the evolution of humanity towards a possible but rather an active man so as to avoid the possibility that one day we would all become radioactive
from to adhesion political scientist and it was not easy for someone accustomed to reasoning in terms of evolution of classes and the struggle between classes to understand and accept that something fantastic and reassuring exists behind tradition
but through the messages of the all the seeming absurdities of the biblical writings suddenly became for me noble practical and of infinite importance
the knowledge that man is not the result of random chance but the scientific and wise creation of someone who made him in his image and in his resemblance what a sublime truth and to think that one day men of the earth will be equal to their creators the now the time announced has arrived
the light of the close to men has started his mission
a f r a it now rests with us as guides who would help him to continue to help him by spreading the messages of our heavenly fathers more than ever so that the earth in turn will join the concert of civilizations who exist in the infinity of the universe
a new art of living psychologist there exists in the universe an indefinite number of psychosomatic emotional entities or if you prefer personalities with their respective biological energetic and mental activities
the social relationships of these entities necessitate a very important adaptation faculty without which man could not form a social group
mans mental riches are conditioned by his aptitude which allows him at any given time to question all which composes his life and makes him happy or i have used this same faculty when trying to trace the path which would lead me to personal consciousness and progress
the knowledge of man is a question of versatility
one must slip into the smallest openings of the conscious then evolve in the deepest layers of the subconscious without destroying their fauna the devil take the frustrations but one must nevertheless acknowledge i frustrate you you frustrate me
the story never changes and we are always if you wish to climb inside your head you must first learn to be scratched as you climb there are so many things that you will not want to see
so face them and start laughing at yourself seeing how vain you can be the more conscious you will become of your stupidity and your vanity the greater person you will become and you will never hurt again because you will have assumed yourself totally before loving yourself
i f t he it was in this state of mind that i recognized the finality of the messages first i recognized then i digested in a long digestive process which had its periods of activity i must confess
at first it was not a simple coincidence but a real collision where an enormous brainwashing more or less conscious was released putting back each thing in its place
a psychologist being by definition a disorganized person on the outside but fairly well organized on the inside i was stunned to see how the information revealed by the not only found its place in my mind but also established an incredible synthesis between the elements of my life
what is even more incredible is the creative changes which i now use to help my patients
actions causing reactions i was led to verify one by one each of the principal elements of the messages
quite honestly i came to a number of conclusions some were absurd others less so
i refuse to follow a credo because the mental operations related to believing have nothing to do with the operations conducting logical reasoning even with subjective
i do not blindly believe in i truly understand their role and their presence in a true and reflected manner in complete understanding of the decor
thus supported by these conclusions i took a second look at the important points of my formation
i turned upside down and then sideways but to my great surprise i did not find much of anything either on one side or the other
i was supposed to remedy the sickness of the mind and i had just discovered how ridiculous and limited i really was
i have discovered that psychotherapy rests on a base which is well disguised
if you look at it from this angle this thought is not very reassuring nor is it very clean
but on the other hand who has never been cheated by society be that as it may one must react to those and so here i am on this slow boat which carries the truth beauty sanity and which builds a liberating progress
the messages given to by the are in my own mind the most intelligent answer which i could ever find t r a n a o f l on the origins of humanity as well as the destiny of our civilization and enlightenment on the anatomy of a new art of living
i adhere to this impulse without any hesitation
i refuse to concentrate my life on an individual ideology
a profound instinct has led me to study this report an old instinct a little forgotten which gives a man the strength to rise again
each man has it each one of us can participate in the renovation of the collective life at his own level while using his adaptation faculty and his instinct for survival
here are the two things which make man the creature which is more likely to be able to modify his terrestrial and cosmic environment and which authorize him to make the ultimate choice in the great moments of history
never has society been so close to its goals and its only natural for it to be so disturbed
past history with events incontestable of values of suffering
the present shows the logical issues of the great rules of evolution
the future offers a panorama bursting with possibilities due to the union of moral values with the capital technical and scientific values
these are the motivations which have led me to understand the messages given by the
i am happy to have had the opportunity to give my testimony
i give my firm support to the messages without any reservations and my aspirations are in the image of the steps which brought about the creation of life on our encounter of n about were at la near in in the south west of for the first anniversary of the contact of commemorating the time when had been taken to the planet of the and had received the message contained in the second book the took me to their planet
the meeting was to take place at
at everyone had arrived and gathered around
there was a profound feeling of harmony among the participants who were all thrilled to spend these few moments with the last of the great prophets
suddenly someone cried what is that falling from the sky great flakes were falling from the near cloudless sky
they seemed to be made of a substance which when touched melted in a few seconds
then someone cried look there is something very shiny in the sky two luminous objects both very bright were just above us
the fall of the flakes lasted about ten minutes then the objects suddenly disappeared
a guide from who worked in a research laboratory was able to obtain a sample of the flakes but upon taking them for analysis they
all the people who were privileged to live this extraordinary experience had not been disappointed even if it had meant a long trip half way across for some and for others even further to o have their cellular plan transmitted by
at the precise moment and the exact location of where the meeting was going to take place the had offered a sign to those present which they would never forget
for the first time had not been the only witness to the activities
there were people with him who can testify to the phenomenon
the guide from found out later from reading a book that the same phenomenon had been observed in brazil and most noticeably in during a football game which had to be interrupted
there were always the same brilliant vessels and the flakes
insists that the gatherings are not aimed at being witnesses to the sighting of but nevertheless many participants still wish that the would again grant them the pleasure of appearing  the message of the march transmitted telepathically to at midnight i through the words of my messenger address to the people of the earth the following message beware it is not impossible that other extraterrestrial civilizations will make contact very soon with the people of the earth
they are people we have also created scientifically in another part of the universe and with whom we maintain presently no direct communication for reasons that we can not explain to you now without creating a serious imbalance
you must simply know that we are counting on you to reveal to those people their true origin for they are your brothers from space and like you are looking for their creator
tell them the truth about their creation by revealing to them the book which tells the truth and the message of of year of the age of apocalypse i f t he it is important to note that this is the one and only message which has ever received telepathically in three years
all that men should know or nearly all has been said in the first two messages
modification of the new the sixth of the new found in the second message is modified in order to avoid exaggerated of the head of the movement the guide of guides will be elected for a seven year term by level five guides who must number at least to vote
until there are at least level fives the levels four and five guides will join together in a vote and there must be a total of people to decide
if there are not sufficient guides at these two levels the level three guides will be admitted to vote
the guide of guides will be elected between the levels four and five and will be eligible for reelection at the end of his mandate of seven years
this modification also implies a modification of the fourth of the new also contained in the second message the annual donation which is equal to at least one per cent of net annual revenue should be made payable to the foundation
this will provide for the needs of the guide of guides and permit him to devote himself full time to his mission spreading the messages
this modification suggested by was accepted by our creators who understand the need for these changes so that the movement may become more efficient and accelerate the diffusion of the messages
message of the it is now years ago that through the mouth of our prophet our beloved son we gave to the men and women of the earth a e our final message
the one which as predicted came to destroy the mystery of god
it has been years during which you who have officially and publicly recognized us as your creators have worked so that we may be welcomed in the requested embassy
your devotion and your efforts have warmed our hearts and the most devoted among you are among those who will be rewarded
in all the religions there are people who deserve our love but are the ones closest to us
they are our new chosen people and will one day have a new promised land because their love is based on consciousness and understanding and not on blind faith
those who loved us as one or several supernatural gods were precious to our eyes and they did not have a choice in times but those who knowing that we are not supernatural but created in their image continue to love us and even to love us much more touch us to a greater extent and will be rewarded more because they love us with their consciousness and not only with their faith
and it is consciousness that makes them similar to us
we asked that an embassy be built to welcome us near and the authorities of the stiff people have refused several times to grant the necessary authorizations and status
our preference for is merely sentimental because for us is everywhere where human beings love us respect us and wish to welcome us with due respect and the chosen people are those who knowing who we are want to welcome us meaning the
the real on earth are no longer the people of but those who recognize us as their creators and wish to see us return
the link we have with the people of is about to be severed and the new alliance is coming to an end
they have very little time to understand their mistake before being dispersed once again
in the meantime we must from now on ask for the necessary permission and status from all nations on earth for the erection of our embassy and the radius of one kilometer can be composed of water as well as firm land with the condition that navigation be prohibited
i f t he when a country grants this authorization will have for the last time a short period of reflection to grant this authorization and will keep the privilege or the embassy will be built elsewhere and the people of will lose our protection and will be dispersed
the country which will build the embassy on its territory or on a territory it will give or sell to this effect with the necessary status will have a guaranteed and flourishing future will benefit from our protection and will become the spiritual and scientific centre of the whole planet for the to come
the hour of our great return is near and we will support and protect the most devoted ones among you
your enemies will witness our might more and more most especially the from his bishops and all those who act in our name without being year is nothing for us and nothing for a very large majority of people who are not but many false prophets will try to use this change in the millennium to humans
it was expected and it is a selection of the most conscious ones
follow your guide of guides he will know how to avoid the dangers of this time of transition because he is the way the truth the life
is more and more successful on earth and this is good as it is the religion that is closest to the truth and to the new equilibrium necessary for human beings of the new age
without the mystical load of the past gives and more and more will become
may your joy in seeing the approach of our great return give you wings to overcome the last obstacles of the journey
we are so close to this day that whenever you meditate you should be able to feel our presence
and this sensation will illuminate your days and nights and will make your life wonderful no matter what obstacles are left to overcome
the joy of seeing us will be lesser than the pleasure of having worked for this day to come
the greatest pleasure is in the accomplishment of your mission not in its result
in the meantime our love and light will guide you through the words of our beloved prophet and do not forget that even if we constantly see you each a e time he looks at you we see you even more because he what he sees through the love he has for you
the more you love him the more you love us because he is a part of us on earth
if you find it sometimes hard to show us affection it is because you do not have the consciousness of seeing our beloved son walking amongst you once again
you can not love us and neglect him because once again you reach the father through the son because he is among you eats when you eat sleeps when you sleep laughs when you laugh and cries when you do not pretend to love us if you do not treat him as the dearest his love for you is so great that he constantly asks us to forgive things we judge as unforgivable
he is your best advocate in the eyes of your creators
and on your planet where love and forgiveness are more and more rare in a society which is becoming more and more barbaric through a lack of these values he is your most precious asset
you lack love look at him he is alive among you may his light guide you to us whether we return or not because in either case we await you among our
peace and love to all humans of
the united nations the un must disappear to be replaced by a more democratic organization this is what i have been saying for the last years  the un is not a democratic organization
it is an elite club run by a few and modern imperialist all of them from white and western countries
for the un to be truly democratic each nation should be entitled to a vote proportional to its population which means that and i f t he china who represent almost of humanity with a joint population of almost billion would have a corresponding voting power of
the us on the other hand with only million inhabitants which only represents of the world population should have a voting power of only and the with only million inhabitants representing just of the world population should have a voting power of only
but instead the un is ruled by a small group of rich western nations who represent less than of humanity especially those in the so called security council  if bush and other leaders of imperialist countries really want what they claim they want to promote democracy then they must accept a truly democratic un
but the truth is that they really want it what they really want is to continue ruling the world both economically and spiritually
as my setting up of the international committee against calendar imperialism wwwicacciorg pointed out why is the un which is supposed to represent the whole of humanity using the calendar for all its official documents when only of humanity is why should and
who each have their own calendar be forced to sign un papers using the calendar the un could adopt a neutral calendar using as year zero the year of its own inception or the year was bombed as a symbol of peace
but instead it still uses the calendar which forces countries who happen to be the majority to recognize supposed birth date when signing documents without any sensitivity to the feelings of those whose forefathers were massacred bonded into slavery or by in the name of
the un has only two choices completely change and become a truly democratic organization or be destroyed and replaced by a truly neutral and democratic organization
maybe the latter is the best solution as it is always very difficult to change existing things
maybe the new world body which would replace the un will cost much less and be much more democratic made by the a t he u n r people for the people
it could even be a virtual world government where the people can express their choices directly
this democracy would have the added advantage of dispensing with the most dangerous least trustworthy and expensive people on earth politicians
my proposition of a web government wwwupworldgovorg could be the right solution to replace the obsolete un
authors postscript some thirty years have passed since i wrote the three books that now make up this new compendium edition intelligent design message from the designers
i will discuss the reasons behind this new title further on but in the meantime it is important to reflect that a great deal has happened over the past thirty years
our world has continued to change very rapidly during that period always in the direction of the revealed information i was first given in the early to mid s that is why the books are reproduced unchanged here to demonstrate that the extraordinary truths first revealed three decades ago are being gradually and successively proven by new scientific discoveries and developments
i originally published the first part of this book as the book which tells the truth in the language in early
after a sudden unexpected and unforgettable space journey in i followed the first book with took me to their planet in
in i wrote and published lets welcome the making known for the first time information which i had earlier been asked by the to withhold for three years
i have written four other books one entitled which describes an advanced form of democracy advocated by the sensual meditation a teaching book of vital meditative practices designed by the to awaken our senses fully and help us achieve true inner harmony yes to human which outlines the scientific advances soon to be part of our lives in the areas of and and the an anthology selected by leading of my more recent contemporary lectures these books have now been translated into nearly thirty languages by volunteer supporters
in all more than two million copies author p of my books have been sold worldwide
the vast majority have been printed published and distributed under the control of various national branches of the international movement
in the years of its existence the has grown steadily
currently the organization has a total of more than members worldwide and national branches are now established in nearly countries including all the worlds major nations
at present the movement is strongest in south and
it is also expanding strongly in the united states south east and most of the other countries of
more recently new national branches have been founded in and
at regular held on every continent of the world the teachings of the as outlined in these books have been passed on to many thousands of people of all ages by myself and senior members of the
in all there are now over guides or priests worldwide
the movement has two main publications in which i and other leading write of current developments apocalypse an international glossy magazine which is published twice a year and contact a weekly that is distributed at raelianewsorg
these publications help to further the philosophies and insights of the
the birth of the sheep was a landmark event in human scientific history and it then became clear that very soon the of human beings would become fairly commonplace
just as on the planet on earth will become a means for human beings to achieve eternal life
after the sheep was in i initiated a project called to bring attention to the issue of human
soon after dr a brilliant scientist and bishop took over the project and created a company
i withdrew myself completely from any and all involvement since my initial purpose was simply to promote the concept of human so the has no direct connection to whatsoever
i will of course continue to philosophically support dr and her company i f t he in continuing their work and i was especially pleased when she dramatically announced in the front page global headline news that was perhaps the biggest breakthrough of the entire year mission to date had successfully assisted the birth of the worlds first human baby a little girl nicknamed eve
although up to the time of writing legal complexities have delayed publication of the scientific proof of this successful human there was no doubt that the name of the movement and what it stood for had become common knowledge everywhere around the the next step required will be to make possible the transfer of mental information memory and personality from an aging individual into a new physically young adult
this transfer of memory directly into a young adult means that effectively the same individual can live indefinitely
human laws will have to be adapted to our changing culture and increasing technological advances
these are still early days for all such issues but new laws will have to be passed to define criteria setting out who will be allowed to benefit from these
here as on the planet the number of may need to be limited to one per individual and then only after death
this year another breakthrough of perhaps similar magnitude occurred as is mentioned briefly in the to this book when a article appeared in a scientific journal effectively announcing the academic acceptance of a new theory of intelligent design
this publication marked the first formal academic challenge to outdated and evolutionary theory
as a result over the past year or so intelligent design or has attracted growing attention and inspired much debate in academic circles and beyond in and worldwide
in particular as i write these words a raging debate is underway in the united states about the introduction of the intelligent design theory into schools as an alternative to theory of evolution
opponents of this see the move as an attempt to god officially into the nations schools despite the supreme author p courts refusal to allow this almost years ago on the grounds that the clear separation of church and state is written in the constitution
indeed it is very evident at present that religious conservatives are definitely using this camouflage to their dogmatic religious views back into schools
but our very original and unique explanation of the origin of life on earth effectively offers a third option and one which can not be denied by the supreme court as it promote religion in schools it can best be described as intelligent design which is the scientific creation of life on earth performed by an advanced human civilization from another planet
this brings into being a completely new rational theory explaining our origins which is actually reproducible in a laboratory as evidenced by the recent announcement by scientific researcher that he has started the process of creating the first totally synthetic organism
the essential prerequisite for something to be scientific is that it can be reproducible in a laboratory
evolution has never been reproduced in any laboratory why its called a theory and the same goes of course for the theory of god
this third way intelligent design is the only one which can be reproduced in a laboratory right now and is actually about to happen
the idea that there are billions of planets similar to earth in the universe is also accepted by most scientists as is the fact that our planet is not necessarily the most advanced in the universe
so having a much more advanced human civilization coming to earth a long time ago to create life in a kind of is the most rational explanation of our origins
at the very least it is worth being taught in schools as an alternative to the theory of evolution and no school can deny access to an intelligent design theory on the grounds of church and state separation
even believers in god would stand to gain by using our explanation as a horse to enter the school system as an alternative to the monolithic dogmatic and intolerant theory of evolution
having said that it is important to also say that preparations to build the embassy requested by the are also progressing well
i f t he the embassy and residence need to be protected by rights like any normal international diplomatic mission and in accordance with the precise instructions architects have already completed commissioned drawings for the complex of buildings where the most dramatic and extraordinary meeting of world government leaders in history will take place
not long after we built a small scale model of the embassy based on these drawings a crop circle appeared in which bore an astonishing resemblance to it
i have to say that finance is not the chief obstacle to the completion of this project
the political and diplomatic problems are a issue and patience and perseverance will be required to overcome them
in this regard the international movement has several times since made presentations to the government and to the chief rabbi in requesting that the necessary be granted so that the embassy may be built close to where the created the first human beings
the first temple of the religion was in fact a previous embassy around which the ancient city was built
the are now waiting for the state of to grant such status for the new embassy the third temple but so far there has been no positive response to the seven requests that have been made
the first approach was made on on the new year and another official request was made to chief rabbi some months later
the request was acknowledged and a study of the application began
in the summer of an government commission concluded that the movement was peaceful in intent and was of no threat to security
in their report two are believed to have concluded that it would be better not to do anything against in case he really is the awaited
in a further direct request was made to prime minister when he was in attending the convention
after a month mr replied through one of his office representatives that he could not comply
if ultimately declines to allow a grant of extra author p as already indicated we will most likely establish the embassy on or territory or in another neighboring state
in fact the lower slopes of mount would make an excellent alternative choice since that is where the leader of the first appeared to
nevertheless the would prefer to give the opportunity to agree to this request since that is the true purpose of the state of
since the message of the on we have started negotiations with other countries and once we have the go ahead a final last chance request will be made to
already in as a sign of their special feelings towards the people of the agreed to my suggestion to modify their original symbol of infinity when used by movement branches in the west
the central swastika which means wellbeing in and also represents infinity in time was replaced with a swirl
this change was made in an effort to help the negotiations for building the embassy of the in and also out of respect for the sensitivities of the victims who suffered and died under the swastika during the second world war
in where the swastika can be found in most temples and where it represents infinity in time the original symbol is not a problem
this modification of the symbol for the west was of course gladly made and when looking back now and surveying our progress since i can see that everything is going according to plan
the international movement will one day achieve all the goals set by the with or without my participation
i know that it has become and could now function perfectly well without me
much still remains to be done and even when at last the great day dawns and the land openly and officially before the eyes of world government leaders and an international array of television cameras and media representatives some skeptics i expect will still continue to doubt whether these highly advanced human beings could truly have created all life artificially on our planet
the leading members of the and myself are aware that this might be so
but this does not daunt us quite the reverse
i f t he the themselves will definitely land here in the not too distant future around the time of what some call the everything will be understood thanks to science
it will be no later than thirty years from now and may be much sooner if the truths i have described in this book spread more rapidly around the the will bring with them all the great prophets of the past including and
this event will be the most wonderful day in the history of humanity
i hope you will be present when they land at their embassy and i hope that you are able to share the joy of knowing that you played a part in this wonderful adventure
the area where the embassy is to be built will become the spiritual center of the world for millennia to come
people from all nations will come in pilgrimage to this holy place
a replica of the embassy will be built near the real one and opened to the public so that they can see what it is like but will the movements mission end with the coming of our creators not at all on the contrary it will be the real beginning of our mission
with the disappearance of all primitive religions the vacuum will have to be filled with a new spirituality one that is in tune with the technological revolution still to come
we are now human beings using technology with religions and thinking
thanks to the we will be able to reach new spiritual levels by embracing their own religion an one that of infinity as represented by their symbol
the guides of the movement will become the priests of this new religion allowing human beings to feel in harmony with the infinitely small and the infinitely large allowing them to realize that we are and energies forever
laboratories and universities will be built close to the embassy and there under the guidance of the our own scientists will be able to improve their knowledge
in this way we will gradually approach the scientific level
this will enable us to venture out to other planets to create life ourselves and we will become in our author p own turn for those we create
on our own planet and other scientists of realistic vision have already started out along the path of becoming intelligent designers who as they work for the future will be fully aware of the true nature of our past and our origins
through us and through them spirituality and science will walk peacefully together hand in hand free at last from the medieval fears that have haunted our past
this will enable us to become gods ourselves as was written long ago in the ancient scriptures but perhaps rather more accurately or amusingly however lets not forget that our greatest task is to build the embassy for the so that at long last they can come here and land officially and openly among us and they will bring to our very troubled yet potentially very beautiful world their profound teachings of love as well as science
autumn this is what i heard at one time the was in the gardens in the city of accompanied by a multitude of leading monks numbering eight thousand
there were also thousand all known to the assembly persons who had carried out all the basic practices of great wisdom
sustained by the might and supernatural powers of the they accepted and upheld the correct law in order to guard the of the
they knew how to roar the lions roar and their fame in the ten directions
without waiting to be asked they others and brought them comfort
they the continuance and prosperity of the three treasures making certain that these never expired
they conquered and subdued the ill will of the devils and the doctrines
all were spotless and pure having long ago rid themselves of and their minds constantly resided in a state of emancipation
their meditation retention of the teachings and eloquence never faltered and of keeping of the precepts meditation wisdom and the power to employ expedient means there was not one they were deficient in
they had learned to accept the fact that there is nothing to be grasped at no view of phenomena to be entertained
they knew how to respond to others and to turn the wheel of the law
expert in comprehending the characteristics of phenomena able to understand the capacities of living beings they over the others of the great assembly and had learned to be fearful of nothing
with their merits and wisdom they disciplined their minds they adorned their bodies with auspicious signs ranking foremost in aspect and form but rejected all worldly
in fame and renown they soared higher than mount their profound faith was in its firmness
the jewels of their shone everywhere raining down sweet dew and among the assembly the sound of their words was the most subtle and wonderful of all
they had plumbed the depths of dependent origination and cut off all erroneous views no longer entertaining the concepts either of being or
in expounding the law they were fearless as roaring lions and their on it rolled forth like thunder
there was no measuring them for they had passed beyond measure
in seeking out the jewels of the they were like practiced pilots at sea
they had mastered all the profound and subtle meanings of the doctrines and were expert in perceiving the past and future of living beings and the workings of their minds
they came close to the freely exercised wisdom of the the unparalleled one his ten powers his and his eighteen properties
though they had firmly closed the gate to all manner of evil yet they allowed themselves to be born in the five lower realms manifesting themselves there so that they might act as great physician kings healing the ills of others out whatever medicine suited the ailment and insuring that the patient took it as prescribed
countless these they had acquired countless lands all these they had made marvelously pure

there were thousand such as these there were also ten thousand kings and others who had come from the other four continent worlds to visit the place where the was and listen to the
there were also twelve thousand who had come from the other four continent worlds to take a seat in the gathering
in addition there were other heavenly beings of great authority and power as well as dragons spirits and others all come to take a seat in the assembly
also arrived to take seats in the assembly were the various monks nuns laymen and
at that time the surrounded by this multitude of countless hundreds and thousands of beings expounded the law for them
he was like mount king of mountains rising up out of the great sea
resting at ease in his lions seat clustered with jewels he shed his radiance over all the great throng gathered there
at that time a man named jeweled accumulation son of a wealthy man of the city of along with five hundred other sons of wealthy men had come to the place where the was all of them bearing parasols adorned with the seven treasures
bowing their heads in before the feet of the they joined in offering their parasols as to the

they wish to hear how one can purify the lands
we beg the one to explain the practices carried out by in purifying the lands
to purify the lands here means to work diligently to lead the beings of various realms or lands to enlightenment which is one of the chief aims of the activities
the said excellent jeweled accumulation for the sake of the you do right to ask the thus come one about the practices for purifying the lands
listen well listen well and it over in your thoughts i will now explain to you
jeweled accumulation and the other five hundred sons of rich men then made ready to listen to the teachings addressed to them
the said jeweled accumulation the various kinds of living beings are in themselves the lands of the
why so because it is by converting various beings to the teachings that the acquire their lands
it is by persuading various beings and overcoming their objections that the acquire their lands
it is by inducing the various living beings to enter into the wisdom in a land that they acquire their lands
it is by inducing the various living beings to develop the capacity for practices in a land that they acquire their lands
why is this because the acquisition of a pure land is wholly due to his having brought benefit to living beings
suppose a man proposes to build a mansion on a plot of open land
he may do so as he wishes without
but if he tries to build it in the empty air he will never be successful
it is the same with the
it is because they wish to help others to achieve success that they take their vow to acquire lands
their vow to acquire lands in not founded on emptiness
jeweled accumulation you should understand that an upright mind is the pure land of the
when the attains then beings who are free of flattery will be born in his country
the term upright also be translated straightforward mind or direct mind
in the paragraphs that follow the term pure land is being used to mean a state of mind or course of action that allows a to create a land that is pure in nature by leading others to enlightenment
the quality or action in the produces a similar state in the beings who are born in his land for example because he himself is honest and upright in mind they are free from flattery or
a deeply searching mind is the pure land of the
when he attains beings who are endowed with blessings will be born in his country
a mind that aspires to or enlightenment is the pure land of the
when he attains beings dedicated to the great vehicle will be born in his country is the pure land of the
when he attains beings who are capable of casting away everything will be born in his country
keeping of the precepts is the pure land of the
when he attains beings who fulfill their vow to carry out the ten good actions will be born in his country
 is the pure land of the
when he attains beings who are adorned with the features will be born in his country
is the pure land of the
when he attains beings who strive diligently to acquire all manner of blessings will be born in his country meditation is the pure land of the
when he attains beings who can regulate their minds and keep them from disorder will be born in his country
wisdom is the pure land of the
when he attains beings who are correct and certain in understanding will be born in his country
a mind devoted to the four immeasurable qualities is the pure land of the
when he attains beings perfect in the exercise of pity compassion joy and indifference will be born in his country
the four methods of winning people are the pure land of the
when he attains beings who are regulated by the will be born in his country
expedient means are the pure land of the
when he attains beings who can employ all manner of expedient means with complete freedom will be born in his country
the elements of the way are the pure land of the
when he attains beings will be born in his country who are proficient in the four states of the four types of correct effort the four bases of supernatural power the five roots of goodness the five powers the seven factors of enlightenment and the holy path
a mind intent on transferring merit to others is the pure land of the
when he attains he will acquire a country endowed with all manner of blessings
teaching others to avoid the eight difficulties is the pure land of the
when he attains his country will be free of the three evils and the eight difficulties
observing the precepts himself but not taxing others with their shortcomings is the pure land of the
when he attains no one in his country will be called a of
the ten good actions are the pure land of the
when he attains beings will be born in his country who suffer no untimely death possess great wealth are pure in action sincere and truthful in word ever mild in speech never alienated from kin or associates skillful in solving disputes invariably speaking profitable words never envious never irate and correct in understanding
each of the ten merits listed here results from the observance of one of the ten good actions
therefore jeweled accumulation because the has an upright mind he is impelled to action
because he is impelled to action he gains a deeply searching mind
because he has a deeply searching mind his will is well controlled
because his will is well controlled he acts in accord with the teachings
because he acts in accord with the teachings he can transfer merit to others
because he transfers merit to others he knows how to employ expedient means
because he knows how to employ expedient means he can lead others to enlightenment
because he leads others to enlightenment his land is pure
because his land is pure his preaching of the law is pure
because his preaching of the law is pure his wisdom is pure
because his wisdom is pure his mind is pure
and because his mind is pure all the blessings he enjoys will be pure
therefore jeweled accumulation if the wishes to acquire a pure land he must purify his mind
when the mind is pure the land will be pure
at that time moved by the supernatural powers thought to himself if the mind of the is pure then his land will be pure
now when our one first determined to become a surely his intentions were pure
why then is this land so filled with impurities one of the ten major disciples customarily appears in the an of doubts or of erroneous views associated with teachings
but as indicated here the at times deliberately such doubts in mind as a means of furthering the exposition of the doctrine
the knowing his thoughts said to him what do you think are the sun and moon is that why the blind man fails to see them replied no one
that is the fault of the blind man
the sun and moon are not to blame
it is the of living beings that prevent them from seeing the marvelous purity of the land of the the thus come one
the thus come one is not to blame
this land of mine is pure but you fail to see it
at that time one of the kings with his of hair said to you must not think that this land is
why do i say this because to my eyes land is as pure and spotless as the palace of the heavenly being great freedom
said when i look at this land i see it full of and hollows thorny underbrush sand and gravel dirt rocks many mountains filth and
the king said it is just that your mind has highs and lows and does not rest on wisdom
therefore you see this land as
the treats all things and beings each one of them with perfect equality
his deeply searching mind is pure and because it rests on wisdom it can see the purity of this land
the then pressed his toe against the earth and immediately the world was adorned with hundreds and thousands of rare jewels till it resembled jeweled jeweled land of blessings
all the members of the great assembly sighed in wonder at what they had never seen before and all saw that hey themselves were seated on jeweled
that is they perceived that they themselves were possessed of the nature
the said to now do you see the purity of this land replied indeed i do one
i have never seen before and never even heard all he marvelous purity of the land is visible before me the said to my land has always been pure like this
but because i wish to save those persons who are lowly and inferior i make it seem an land full of that is all
it is like the case of heavenly beings
all ate their food from the same precious vessel but the food looks different for each one depending upon the merits and virtues hat each possesses
it is the same in this case
if a persons mind is pure then he will see the wonderful blessings that adorn this land
when the in this way revealed the marvelous purity of the land the five hundred sons of rich men who accompanied jeweled accumulation all were able to grasp the truth of and thousand persons all set their minds on attaining
the then released the supernatural power that he had exercised with his toe and the world returned to its former appearance
thousand heavenly and human beings who wished to pursue the path of the understanding that all things are in nature cast off the dust removed themselves from and attained the pure eye and eight thousand monks ceasing to accept the phenomenal world put an end to all and gained emancipation of mind
expedient means at that time in the great city of there was a rich man named
already in the past he had offered to immeasurable numbers of had deeply planted the roots of goodness and had grasped the truth of
in his eloquence able to himself with transcendental powers he commanded full retention of the teachings and had attained the state of
he had overcome the and ill will of the devil and entered deeply into the doctrine of the law proficient in the of wisdom and a master in the employing of expedient means
he had successfully fulfilled his great vow and could clearly discern how the minds of others were tending
moreover he could distinguish whether their capacities were keen or
his mind was cleansed and purified through long practice of the way firm in its grasp of the great vehicle and all his actions were well thought out and planned
he maintained the dignity and authority of a and his mind was vast as the sea
all the sighed with admiration and he commanded the respect of the of and the four heavenly kings
desiring to save others he employed the excellent expedient of residing in
his immeasurable riches he used to relieve the poor his faultless observation of the precepts served as a reproach to those who would violate
through his restraint and he warned others against rage and anger and his great discouraged all thought of and indolence
concentrating his single mind in quiet meditation he suppressed disordered thoughts through firm and wisdom he overcame all that was not wise
l this paragraph describes practice of the six for which see glossary
though dressed in the white robes of a layman he observed all the rules of pure conduct laid down for monks and though he lived at home he felt no attachment to the threefold world
one could see he had a wife and children yet he was at all times in action obviously he had kin and household attendants yet he always delighted in withdrawing from them
although he wore jewels and his real was the auspicious marks although he ate and drank like others what he truly savored was the joy of meditation
if he visited the gambling parlors it was solely to bring enlightenment to those there if he listened to the doctrines of other religions he did not allow them to impinge on the true faith
though well versed in secular writings his constant delight was in the law
respected by everyone he was looked on as foremost among those deserving of embracing and upholding the correct he gave guidance to old and young
in a spirit of trust and harmony he conducted all kinds of business enterprises but though he reaped worldly profits he took no delight in these
he frequented the busy crossroads in order to bring benefit to others entered the government offices and courts of law so as to aid and rescue all those he could
he visited the places of debate in order to guide others to the great vehicle visited the schools and study halls to further the instruction of the pupils
he entered houses of ill fame to teach the folly of desire entered wine shops in order to encourage those with a will to quit them
if he was among rich men they honored him as foremost among them because he preached the superior law for them
if he was among lay believers they honored him as foremost because he freed them from greed and attachment
among he was most highly honored because he taught them
among he was most highly honored because he rid them of their
the great ministers honored him as foremost because he taught the correct law
the princes honored him as foremost because he showed them how to be loyal and filial
within the quarters he was most honored because he converted and brought refinement to the women of the harem
the common people honored him as first among them because he helped them to gain wealth and power
the deities honored him as first among them because he revealed the superiority of wisdom
the honored him as first among them because he demonstrated the truth of
the four heavenly kings guardians of the world honored him as foremost because he guarded all living beings
in this way the rich man employed immeasurable numbers of expedient means in order to bring benefit to others
using these expedient means he made it appear that his body had fallen prey to illness
because of his illness the king of the country the great ministers rich men lay believers and as well as the princes and lesser officials numbering countless thousands all went to see him and inquire about his illness
then used this bodily illness to the law to them in broad terms good people this body is without durability without strength without firmness a thing that decays in a moment not to be relied on
it suffers it is tormented a meeting place of manifold ills
good people no person of enlightened wisdom could depend on a thing like this body this body is like a cluster of foam nothing you can grasp or handle
this body is like a bubble that can not continue for long
this body is like a flame born of longing and desire
this body is like the plantain that has no firmness in its trunk
this body is like a phantom the product of error and confusion
this body is like a dream compounded of false and empty visions
this body is like a shadow appearing through causes
this body is like an echo tied to causes and conditions
this body is like a drifting cloud changing and vanishing in an instant
this body is like lightning barely lasting from moment to moment
this body is like earth that has no subjective being
this body is like fire devoid of ego
this body is like wind that has no set life span
this body is like water devoid of individuality
this body has no reality but makes these four elements its lodging
this body is void removed from self and possessions
this body is without understanding like plants or trees tiles or pebbles
this body is without positive action blown about by the wind
this body is crammed with and evil
this body is empty and unreal though for a time you may bathe and clothe and feed it in the end it must crumble and fade
this body is beset by a hundred and one ills and anxieties
this body is like the abandoned well on the hillside old age pressing in on it
this body has no but is destined for certain death
this body is like poisonous snakes bandits or an empty village a mere coming together of components realms and
good people a thing like this is irksome and hateful and therefore you should seek the body
why because the body is the body
it is born from immeasurable merits and wisdom
it is born from precepts meditation wisdom emancipation and the insight of emancipation
it is born from pity compassion joy and indifference
it is born of the various such as keeping of the precepts and gentleness in religious practice meditation emancipation and wide knowledge and wisdom
it is born of expedient means born of the six transcendental powers born of the three understandings born of the elements of the way born of concentration and insight born of the ten powers the four kinds of and the eighteen properties
it is born of the cutting off of all things not good and the gathering in of all good things born of the truth born of the avoidance of indulgence and
the body of the thus come one is born of immeasurable numbers of pure and spotless things such as these
good people if you wish to gain the body and do away with the ills that all living beings then you must set your minds on attaining
in this manner the rich man used the occasion to preach the law to those who came to inquire about his illness
as a result thousands of persons were all moved to set their minds on the attainment of
the disciples at that time the rich man thought to himself i am lying here sick in bed
why does the one in his great compassion fail to show some concern for me the aware of this thought said to you must go visit and inquire about his illness
but replied to the in these words one i am not competent to visit him and inquire about his illness
why because i recall one occasion in the past when i was sitting in quiet meditation under a tree in the forest
at that time approached and said to me ah you should not assume that this sort of sitting is true quiet sitting quiet sitting means that in this threefold world you manifest neither body nor will
this is quiet sitting
not rising out of your of complete cessation and yet showing yourself in the ceremonies of daily is quiet sitting
not abandoning the principles of the way and yet showing yourself in the activities of a common is quiet sitting
your mind not fixed on internal things and yet not engaged with is quiet sitting
unmoved by sundry theories but practicing the elements of the is quiet sitting
entering nirvana without having put an end to earthly is quiet sitting
if you can do this kind of sitting you will merit the seal of approval
at that time one when i heard him speak these words i remained silent for i had no way to reply to them
that is why i am not competent to visit him and inquire about his illness
the then said to you must go visit and inquire about his illness
but replied to the one i am not competent to visit him and inquire about his illness
why because i recall how in the past i entered the great city of and in its streets and lanes expounded the for the lay believers
at that time approached and said to me ah when you the for the lay believers you should not it the way you are doing expounding the should be done in accordance with the reality itself
the knows nothing of living beings because it is removed from the of such concepts as living beings
the knows nothing of i because it is removed from the of such concepts as i it knows nothing of a life span because it knows nothing of birth and death
it knows nothing of individuality because it is cut off from considerations of past or future lives
the is forever still and serene because it has wiped out all characteristics
the is without characteristics because it is without anything that can be perceived
the is without names or because it is cut off from all language
the is without any expounding because it is removed from broad or minute contemplation by the mind
the is without forms or characteristics because it is as though vacant and empty
the is not the subject of frivolous theories because in the end it is empty
the is without the concept of mine because it is removed from all such concepts of personal possession
the is without distinctions because it is apart from all types of consciousness
the has nothing it can compare to because there is no entity that can be set beside it
the is not affected by causes because it does not exist in a conditioned realm
the is identical with the because it enters into all phenomena
the conforms with what is truly so because there is nothing else to conform to
the abides in the locus of reality being unaffected by anything on the periphery
the is without motion or never depending on the six sense objects
the is without coming or going since it never abides anywhere to begin with
the accords with emptiness follows what is responds to what is
the is separate from beautiful or ugly
the knows no increase or diminution the knows no birth or extinction the knows no destination
the transcends eyes ears nose tongue body and mind
the knows no high or low
the constantly abides without moving
the is separate from all practices
ah since the characteristics of the are such as these how can one it expounding the means no expounding no demonstrating and listening to the means no listening no grasping
it is like a of expounding the for phantom persons
it is with this understanding that you should the
you should take into account that some living beings are keen in capacity while others are dull cultivate the kind of skilled insight that is free from all impediment with a mind steeped in great compassion praise the great vehicle and remember the debt of gratitude you owe the never allowing the three treasures to come to an end
when you have done all this then you may the
when expounded the in this way eight hundred lay believers set their minds on the attainment of
i possess no such eloquence as this
therefore i say that i am not competent to visit him and inquire about his illness
the then said to you must go visit and inquire about his illness
but replied to the one i am not competent to visit him and inquire about his illness
why because i recall how in the past i was begging for in a poor village
at that time approached and said to me ah you have a mind marked by compassion and pity but you do not know how to apply it to all alike
instead you shun the rich and mighty and beg among the poor
you must abide by the principle of equanimity and in that spirit go about begging for food
because in the end there is no such thing as eating in that spirit one goes about begging for food
because one wishes to destroy dependence on things characterized by a mere combination of elements in that spirit one accepts these balls of
because in the end there is no receiving in that spirit one receives this food
when you enter a village think of it as an empty village
the forms you see there should appear as they would to a blind man the sounds you hear should be mere echoes
the aromas you should be so much thin air the flavors you taste should be undifferentiated
accept all sensations in accordance with the enlightenment of wisdom and understand that all phenomena are no more than phantom forms
they have no intrinsic nature nor do they take on any other nature
l or according to another interpretation intrinsically they have never been on fire and hence will never burn out
the character can mean either so or thus or to burn
if without casting aside the eight errors you can enter into the eight if while possessing the marks of error you can enter the correct law if with one meal you can feed all beings offering to the and the sages and worthy persons then after that you may eat your food
one who eats in this manner neither possesses earthly desires nor is separated from earthly desires neither enters into a meditative state of mind nor arises out of such a state neither dwells in this world nor dwells in nirvana
one who gives in this manner derives neither great fortune nor little fortune neither profit nor loss
this is the correct way to enter the way without relying on the path of the
if you can eat your food in this manner then you will not be eating in vain the food that others give you
at that time one when i heard him speak these words i gained what i had never had before and i was inspired with a profound respect for all the
and i thought to myself if this householder possesses such eloquence and wisdom that he can speak like this then who could listen to him without being moved to set his mind on the attainment of from that time on i ceased to urge others to follow the path of the or the
that is why i say i am not competent to visit him and inquire about his illness
the then said to you must go visit and inquire about his illness
but replied to the one i am not competent to visit him and ask about his illness
why because i recall how in the past i went to his house to beg
at that time took my begging bowl filled it with things to eat and said ah if one can look on all foods as equal that person can look on all things as equal and if one looks on all things as equal one will look on all foods as equal
if one begs in this manner then one is worthy to receive food
if you can not cut yourself off from anger and stupidity and yet not be a part of these if you can refrain from destroying the idea of a self and yet see all things as of a single nature if without wiping out stupidity and attachment you can find your way to understanding and freedom from attachment if you can seem to be a perpetrator of the five cardinal sins and yet gain emancipation if you can be neither unbound nor bound neither one who has perceived the four noble truths nor one who has not perceived them neither one who the fruits of religious practice nor one who does not obtain them neither a common mortal nor one who has removed himself from the ways of the common mortal neither a sage nor not a in this manner you can master all phenomenal things and yet remove yourself from the ways that mark them then you will be worthy to receive food
if without seeing the or listening to his law you are willing to take those six teachers and as your teachers leave the household life because of them and follow them in falling into the same errors they fall into then you will be worthy to receive food
if you can subscribe to erroneous views and thus never reach the other shore of enlightenment if you can remain among the eight difficulties and never escape from difficulty and can make common cause with earthly desires and remove yourself from a state of purity if when you attain the of you allow all living beings to attain the same degree of concentration if those who give you are not destined to gain good fortune thereby and those who make offerings to you fall into the three evil paths of existence if you are willing to join hands with the host of devils and make the your companion if you can be no different from all these devils and these dusts and if you can bear hatred toward all living beings the the law not be counted among the assembly of monks and in the end never attain you can do all this then you will be worthy to receive food
at that time one when i heard these words i was not knowing what sort of words they were or how to answer them
i put down my bowl intending to leave the house but said to me ah pick up your bowl and do not be afraid
why do i say this if some phantom person conjured up by the thus come one were to you as i have just done you would not be afraid would you no i replied
said all things in the phenomenal world are just such and conjured beings
so you have no cause to feel afraid
why because all words and pronouncements too are no different from these other phantom forms
when a person is wise he does not cling to words and hence is not afraid of them
why because words are something apart from do not really exist
and this is emancipation
all things of the phenomenal world bear this mark of emancipation
when expounded the law in this manner two hundred heavenly beings gained the purity of the eye
therefore i say i am not competent to visit him and ask about his illness
the then said to you must go visit and ask about his illness
but said to the one i am not competent to visit him and ask about his illness
why because i recall how once under a tree in the great forest i was expounding the law to some monks who had just begun their study of the way
at that time approached and said to me ah you should first enter into meditation and observe a persons mind before expounding the law to that person
one does not put rotten food in a precious vessel
you must determine what thoughts are in the minds of these monks
do not treat precious as though it were mere glass you seem unable to understand the basic capacities of living beings
you must not try to rouse their aspirations by preaching the doctrines of the lesser vehicle
do not inflict injury on those who are without wounds if you want them to travel the great highway do not show them a little
do not try to fit the vast ocean into an do not regard the light of the sun as if it were a glimmer these monks long ago set their minds on the great vehicle but later they forgot their original intentions
why do you use the doctrines of the lesser vehicle to teach and guide them as i see it the wisdom of the lesser vehicle is trite and shallow like the understanding of a blind person
it is incapable of discerning whether the capacities of living beings are keen or dull
at that time entered into making it possible for these monks to become aware of their former
in the past under five hundred they had planted the roots of virtue and set their minds on the attainment of
and at that moment they were suddenly able to regain their original spirit of resolve
with that the monks bowed their heads at feet
then he preached the law for them insuring that they would never again in their striving for
and i thought to myself that a should never preach the law when he can not discern peoples inner capacities
therefore i say i am not competent to visit and inquire about his illness
the then said to you must go visit and ask about his illness
but said to the one i am not competent to visit him and ask about his illness
why because i recall how in the past the was once summing up for the monks the essential points in his preaching of the law later i expounded and elaborated on what he had said discussing the meaning of the terms suffering emptiness and tranquil extinction or nirvana
at that time approached and said to me ah you must not try to on the true nature of phenomena when your mind is concerned with distinctions such as birth or extinction
for in the end all know neither birth nor is the meaning of
the five components are wide open empty nothing arising in is the meaning of suffering
the various phenomena ultimately have no is the meaning of emptiness
ego and are not two different is the meaning of
phenomena have never been so to begin with and hence will never cease to be is the meaning of tranquil extinction
or according to another interpretation things have never been on fire to begin with so they can not go out now
see note in this chapter
when he expounded the law in this way the minds of the monks were able to gain emancipation
that is why i say i am not competent to visit and ask about his illness
the then said to you must go visit and ask about his illness
but said to the one i am not competent to visit him and ask about his illness
why because i recall how once i was walking around to stretch my legs when a king named austere purity accompanied by ten thousand all emitting beams of pure light came to the place where i was
bowing his head in he questioned me saying how far can this divine eye of yours see was known among the ten major disciples as foremost in divine sight
i replied sir i can see this whole world the land of as though i were peering down at a fruit in the palm of my hand
at that time approached and said to me ah this sight possessed by the divine it conditioned in nature or is it unconditioned if it is conditioned in nature then it is the same as the five transcendental powers of the teachers
and if it is unconditioned then it is and hence is incapable of seeing anything
at that time i remained silent
but the hearing his words gained what they had never had before
at once they made to him and said in this world who possesses the true divine eye replied only the the one is able to acquire the true divine eye
he is constantly in a state of and can see all the lands because he does not see in terms of
thereupon the king austere purity and his retinue of five hundred deities all set their minds on the attainment of
they bowed at feet and then suddenly were seen no more
therefore i say i am not competent to visit and ask about his illness
the then said to you must go visit and ask about his illness
but replied to the one i am not competent to visit him and ask about his illness
why because i recall once in the past when two monks had violated the rules of conduct and were feeling ashamed of themselves but did not dare ask the what to do
so they came to me and said ah we have violated the precepts and are truly ashamed but we do not dare ask the what to do
please free us from our doubts and remorse and tell us how we can be excused from blame
was known as foremost in observing the precepts
i explained to them how one goes about gaining pardon according to the law but at that time approached and said to me ah do not make the offense these monks have committed even worse than it is you should go about wiping out their doubts and remorse at once and not trouble their minds further why do i say this because their offense by its nature does not exist either inside them or outside or in between
as the has taught us when the mind is the living being will be
when the mind is pure the living being will be pure
as the mind is so will be the offense or
the same is true of all things for none escape the realm of
now if one gains emancipation from delusion through an understanding of the nature of the mind does any remain no i replied
said in the same way when all living beings gain an understanding of the nature of the mind then no exists
ah deluded thoughts are
where there are no deluded thoughts that is purity
thinking is
where there is no thinking that is purity
belief in the self is
where there is no such belief that is purity
all phenomena are born and pass into extinction never enduring like like lightning
they do not wait for one another or linger for an instant
all phenomena are the product of deluded vision like dreams like flames like the moon in the water or an image in a mirror born of deluded thoughts
one who understands this is called a keeper of the precepts one who understands this is called well liberated
at this the two monks exclaimed superlative wisdom could never match this he who is foremost in observing the precepts could never speak like this and i added leaving the thus come one aside no or has ever commanded such eloquence in apt exposition
see how clear and penetrating his wisdom is at that time the doubts and remorse of the two monks were wiped away and they set their minds on the attainment of vowing that we will enable all living beings to gain eloquence such as this therefore i say i am not competent to visit and ask about his illness
the then said to you must go visit and ask about his illness
but said to the one i am not competent to visit him and ask about his illness
why because i recall how once in the past the sons of the wealthy men of came to the place where i was bowed their heads in and questioned me
ah they said you are the son but you cast aside your claim to the rank of a king and left the household life to become a monk
what benefits does one acquire by leaving the household life i explained to them the benefits and blessings one gains by leaving the household life as the law describes them
but at that time approached and said to me ah you should not speak of the benefits and blessings gained by leaving the household life
why because to be without benefits and without blessings is to leave household life
in the case of things that are conditioned in nature one may speak of them as having benefits and blessings
but one who leaves household life enters the realm of the unconditioned and in the realm of the unconditioned there are no benefits no blessings
leaving the household life is not that not this and not in between
it means abandoning the erroneous views to reside in nirvana it is accepted by the wise and carried out by the sages
it means conquering and subduing the host of devils moving beyond the five realms of existence purifying the five eyes acquiring the five powers and cultivating the five roots of goodness
it means not troubling others but removing oneself from sundry evils the doctrines transcending the realm of makeshift names shaking off mud and
it is without ties or attachments without personal possessions without thought of possessions without or confusion
it means harboring joy within guarding the minds of others pursuing the practice of meditation and freeing oneself from all fault
if one can do all this then one has truly left the household
then addressed the rich sons saying now that you are in the midst of the correct law you should all join in leaving the household life
why because it is rare to happen on a time when the is in the world but the rich sons said layman we have heard the say that one must not leave the household life without the permission of ones parents
in that case you should set your minds on attaining said
that is the same as leaving the household the same as taking monastic vows
at that time rich sons all set their minds on attaining
therefore i say i am not competent to visit and ask about his illness
the then said to you must go visit and ask about his illness
but said to the one i am not competent to visit him and ask about his illness
why because i recall once in the past when the one was feeling somewhat ill and needed some cows milk
i at once took my begging bowl went to the home of one of the great and stood by the gate
at that time approached and said to me ah what are you doing standing here early in the morning with your begging bowl i replied layman the one is suffering from a slight bodily illness and needs some cows milk
why come here
but said hush hush never speak such words the body of the thus come one is in substance
all evils have been cut away manifold good things gather there
how could it know illness how could it know distress go your way in silence and do not the thus come one
let others hear you speaking such coarse words let these heavenly beings of great majesty and virtue and these who have come from the pure lands of other regions hear such utterances even a sage king with his few blessings is still able to exempt himself from illness
how much more so then the thus come one in whom immeasurable blessings meet the of all be on your way and do not inflict this shame on us
if the and should hear such talk they would think to themselves why call this man teacher he can not save himself from illness so how could he save others from their illnesses slip away quickly now so no one will hear what you have said you should know that the body of the thus come one is the body not the body of the world of thought and desires
the is the one who transcends the threefold world
the body is free of for all its have been cut off
the body is unconditioned and does not fall within the realm of destinies
a body such as could it know illness how could it know distress at that time one i felt truly ashamed and thought i must go to the and ask if i heard him
but at that moment i heard a voice in the sky saying it is as the layman has said
but the has appeared in this evil world of five impurities and at present is practicing the law so as to save and liberate living beings
go get the milk and do not feel ashamed but one commands such wisdom and eloquence as this that is why i say i am not competent to visit him and ask about his illness
thus all five hundred of the major disciples one by one described to the some earlier experience and the words that had spoken on that occasion each declaring i am not competent to visit him and ask about his illness
the the then said to the you must go visit and inquire about his illness
but replied to the one i am not competent to visit him and inquire about his illness
why because i recall how once in the past i was preaching to the king of the heaven and his followers on the practices required to attain the state of
at that time approached and said to me the one prophesied that with one more birth you will be able to attain
now just what birth does this prophecy apply to does it apply to your past birth your future birth or your present birth if it applies to a past birth that past birth has already passed into extinction
if it applies to a future birth that future birth has yet to arrive
and if it applies to a present birth this present birth lacks permanence
for as the has said monks one moment you are born the next you grow old the next you pass into extinction
or does the prophecy apply to the state of but is none other than the state of correct realization and the stage of correct realization can have nothing to do with prophecies of enlightenment or with the attainment of
so how can you be given this prophecy about one birth were you given this prophecy because of some birth that pertains to or were you given this prophecy because of some extinction that pertains to if you were given this prophecy because of some birth that pertains to you should know that in there is no birth
and if you were given this prophecy because of some extinction that pertains to you should know that in there is no extinction
all living beings are a part of and all other things as well are a part of
the sages and worthy ones too are a part of even you are a part of
so if you have been given a prophecy of enlightenment then all living beings should likewise be given such a prophecy
why because knows no dualism or differentiation
if you are able to attain then all living beings should likewise be able to attain it
why because all living beings in truth bear the marks of
if you are able to gain nirvana then all living beings should likewise be able to gain it
why because the know that all living beings bear the marks of tranquil extinction which is nirvana and that there is no further extinction
therefore you must not use doctrines such as this to these offspring of the gods
for in truth there is no such thing as setting ones mind on the attainment of or of attaining the state of
you should persuade these offspring of the gods to abandon any view that makes distinctions concerning
why because is not something that can be acquired by the body or acquired by the mind
tranquil extinction is for in it all marks become extinct
is for it is divorced from all causes
is for it is devoid of thought and mental activity cutting off is for it all views
removal is for it means the removal of all deluded thoughts
blocking is because it blocks out all aspiration
is because it is without greed or attachment
compliance is because it with
abiding is because it abides in the
extending is for it extends to the limit of reality
is for it is removed from thoughts and thought objects
equality is for in it all is equally empty and void
the unconditioned is for it knows no birth abiding or extinction
understanding is for it fully the mental activities of living beings
is because it enters into no kind of engagement with objects
is because it has freed itself from the habits of earthly desire
the is because it lacks shape or form
the named is because names and words are void
is for it neither nor lets go
is for it is forever still of itself
good is for it is pure in nature
is for it is removed from distracting causes
is for in it all phenomena are equal
incomparable is for no simile can convey it
subtle and wonderful is for phenomena are hard to understand
one when expounded the law in this fashion two hundred offspring of the gods were able to grasp the truth of
therefore i say i am not competent to visit him and ask about his illness
the then said to the shining a young boy you must go visit and ask about his illness
but shining replied to the one i am not competent to visit him and inquire about his illness
why because i remember once in the past when i was leaving the great city of
was just then entering the city and i accordingly bowed to him and said layman where are you coming from he replied i am coming from the place of practice
some texts read the tranquillity of meditation
the place of is that i asked
he replied an upright mind is the place of practice for it is without sham or falsehood
the resolve to act is the place of practice for it can judge matters properly
a deeply searching mind is the place of practice for it multiplies benefits
the mind that aspires to is the place of practice for it is without error or misconception
is the place of practice because it hopes for no reward
observance of the precepts is the place of practice because it brings fulfillment of vows
is the place of practice because it one to view all living beings with a mind free of
is the place of practice because it and regression
meditation is the place of practice because it makes the mind tame and gentle
wisdom is the place of practice because it sees all things as they are
pity is the place of practice for it views all living beings equally
compassion is the of practice for it bears up under weariness and pain
joy is the place of practice for it revels in delight
indifference is the place of practice for it rejects both hatred and love
transcendental powers are the place of practice because thereby one masters the six powers
emancipation is the place of practice because it knows how to and set aside
expedient means are the place of practice because they can teach and convert living beings
the four methods of winning people are the place of practice because they can win living beings over
much learning is the place of practice because one carries out what one has learned
a disciplined mind is the place of practice because one can thereby all phenomena correctly the elements of the way are the place of practice because through them one rejects what is conditioned
truth is the place of practice because it does not deceive the world
some texts read the four noble truths
causes and conditions are the place of practice for none of the links in the chain of from ignorance to old age and death ever come to an end
earthly desires are the place of practice for through them we know the nature of
living beings are the place of practice for through them we know that there is no ego
all phenomena are the place of practice for through them we know the emptiness of all phenomena
conquering devils is the place of practice because one is
the threefold world is the place of practice because there is no path for one there
the lions roar is the place of practice because it has nothing it fears
the ten powers the four kinds of the eighteen properties are the place of practice because they are free of all fault
the three understandings are the place of practice because they are without the least
understanding all phenomena in one instant of thought is the place of practice because one thereby becomes master of all wisdom
my good fellow if apply themselves to the and teach and convert living beings then you should understand that everything they do every lifting of a foot every placing of a foot will in effect be a coming from the place of practice an abiding in the law
when preached the law in this manner five hundred heavenly and human beings all set their minds on attaining
therefore i say i am not competent to visit him and ask about his illness
the then said to the of the age you must go visit and ask about his illness
but of the age said to the one i am not competent to visit him and inquire about his illness
why because i recall once when i was staying in my quiet room
at that time the devil king accompanied by twelve thousand heavenly maidens appeared in the guise of the god
playing on musical instruments and singing they came to where i was and then the devil and his retinue bowed their heads at my feet pressed their palms together and stood to one side
i thought it was and i said to him welcome
though you enjoy good fortune you should never behave willfully
you should contemplate the of the five desires and strive thereby to plant good roots
with body life and resources you should cultivate the law
but said to me upright one please accept these twelve thousand heavenly maidens
they can serve and wait on you
i replied a monk a son of has no use for unlawful things such as these
it would not be right for me to accept them
before i had finished speaking approached and said to me this is not
this is only a devil who has come t trouble and vex you
then he said to the devil you may give these women to me
it is quite all right for me to accept them
the devil was alarmed and fearful thinking that was perhaps going to make trouble for him
he tried to hide himself and escape but he could not make himself invisible
though he exhausted all his supernatural powers he could not get away just then a voice was heard in the sky saying give him the women
then you can escape
the devil terrified looked this way and that and then handed over the women
then addressed the women saying the devil has given you to me
now it is proper that you should all set your minds on attaining
then adopting whatever approach was appropriate he expounded the law to them awakening in them a desire for the way
then he said that you have conceived a desire for the way you may yourselves with delight and need no longer delight in the pleasures of the five desires
is another name for
the heavenly maidens asked what is this you call delight replied to delight in constant faith in the to delight in the desire to hear the law to delight in giving to the assembly to delight in casting off the five desires to delight in viewing the five components as bandits to delight in viewing the four great elements as poisonous snakes to delight in viewing the mind and the senses as an empty village to delight in pursuing and guarding a desire for the way to delight in living beings to delight in honoring and supporting teachers to delight in practicing widespread generosity to delight in strict observance of the precepts to delight in patience humility gentleness and harmony to delight in diligently amassing good roots to delight in meditation that is never disordered to delight in bright wisdom to delight in broadening the mind that aspires to to delight in conquering and subduing devils to delight in cutting off all earthly desires to delight in purifying the lands to delight in gaining merits so that one may in time succeed in acquiring auspicious marks and characteristics to delight in the place of practice to delight in listening fearlessly to profound teachings to delight in the three gates to emancipation and not to delight in untimely teachings to delight in being friendly with those of like learning to delight in a mind free of anger and hostility when among those of unlike learning to delight in guiding and protecting evil friends to delight in being friendly with good friends to delight in a mind that finds joy in purity to delight in practicing the teachings regarding the immeasurable elements of the make up the delight of the
then addressed the women saying i want now to return with you to my heavenly palace
but the women said you gave us to this layman
possessing this delight that affords us such pleasure we no longer delight in the pleasures of the five desires
the devil said layman you should give up these women
he who gives all he possesses as a gift to others is a
replied i have already given them up
you may take them away and may you enable all living beings to fulfill their desire for the but the women said to how can we remain in the palace of the devil replied sisters there is a teaching called the inexhaustible lamp
you must study it
this inexhaustible lamp is like a single lamp that lights a hundred or a thousand other lamps till the darkness is all made bright with a brightness that never ends
in this same way sisters one guides and opens a path for a hundred or a thousand living beings causing them to set their minds on attaining
and this desire for the way will never be extinguished or go out
by following the teaching as it has been preached one keeps adding until one has acquired all good teachings
this is what is called the inexhaustible lamp
although you live in the palace of the devil with this inexhaustible lamp you can enable countless heavenly sons and heavenly daughters to set their minds on attaining
thus you will repay the debt of gratitude you owe the and at the same time bring great benefit to all living beings
at that time the heavenly maidens bowed their heads at feet and then accompanied the devil back to his palace suddenly disappearing from sight
one such are the freely commanded supernatural powers wisdom and eloquence that possesses therefore i say i am not competent to visit him
the then said to good virtue one of the wealthy sons you must go visit and ask about his illness
but good virtue said to the one i am not competent to visit him and inquire about his illness
why because i recall once when a great bestowal gathering was held at my fathers house where for a period of seven days were given out to all the monks and believers and to poor and humble folk orphans persons and beggars
at that time who had joined the gathering said to me you are a wealthy mans should not be holding a great bestowal gathering such as this
you should hold a gathering for bestowal
why hold a gathering for the bestowal of mere material goods layman i said what do you mean by a gathering for bestowal he replied a gathering for bestowal is one which has no beginning and no end in which are given out simultaneously to all living beings
what does this mean it means that through one cultivates a loving mind through saving living beings one cultivates a mind of great compassion through adherence to the correct law one cultivates a joyful mind and through ones grasp of wisdom one exercises an indifferent mind
by controlling and greed one carries out the of or by converting those who violate the precepts one carries out the of or keeping of the precepts through the doctrine of no ego one carries out the of or by attachment to the characteristics of body and mind one carries out the of or through an understanding of the nature of one carries out the of or meditation and through wisdom one carries out the of or wisdom
by teaching and converting living beings one comes to understand emptiness by not casting aside conditioned phenomena one comes to understand by recognizing that living beings take on visible form one comes to understand
a ceremony marked by sacrifices to the gods and the dispensing of charity to those pursuing the religious life and to needy persons by guarding and upholding the correct law one acquires the power of expedient means by rescuing living beings one acquires the four methods of winning people by respecting and serving others one learns how to banish pride
with regard to body life and wealth one follows the doctrine that these three are with regard to the six objects of reverence one follows the method of thoughtful meditation with regard to the six types of harmonious respect one cultivates a straightforward mind
by correctly practicing the good law one achieves a pure way of life through purity of mind joy and delight one draws near to the worthy ones and sages by not hating evil persons one learns to temper and discipline ones mind
by following the rules for those who have left the household life one cultivates a deeply searching mind by carrying out religious practices in the prescribed way one acquires much learning by observing ways that are free from contention one creates peaceful and surroundings by directing ones efforts toward wisdom one learns quiet meditation by freeing living beings from their bonds one creates a setting for religious practice
acquiring auspicious marks and purifying the lands one pursues actions that bring blessing and good fortune understanding the minds and thoughts of all living beings and preaching the law to them in an appropriate manner one pursues actions that bring wisdom understanding that all phenomena are neither to be seized nor rejected one enters the doctrinal gate of the single nature of all phenomena and pursues wise actions cutting off all earthly desires all blocks and hindrances all doctrines that are not good one pursues all manner of good works acquiring all types of wisdom all good doctrines one cultivates all the methods that aid one to the way
not the ordinary body but the true or eternal body
this my good man is what i mean by a gathering for bestowal
if one is a and abides in such a gathering for bestowal he may be deemed a great donor of and he will also be creating a field of blessings for all the world
one when expounded the law in this fashion two hundred of the gathered there all set their minds on attaining
at that time my mind gained a purity i had never known before and i sighed with delight
bowing my head in at the feet of i took off my jeweled necklace worth hundreds and thousands in gold and presented it to him but he was unwilling to accept it
layman i said i beg you by all means to accept this and to dispose of it as you wish
then accepted the necklace and divided it into two parts
one part he gave to the lowliest beggars in the assembly and one part he presented to the thus come one rarely surpassed
at that time all the members of the gathering were able to see thus come one rarely surpassed in his land called light bright and they could also see the necklace placed on his person
then the necklace changed into a jeweled fitted with four pillars richly adorned on four sides but without screens or enclosing it
there are places in this troublesome passage where cause and effect seem to be in the reverse of their logical order for example one would expect the text to say that because one possesses a mind of great compassion one seeks to save living beings not that through saving living beings one acquires a mind of great compassion
but the seems to be saying the latter and translations of the version bear out this interpretation of the syntax throughout the passage
note that apparently in an effort to avoid such difficulties in his translation of the p arbitrarily reverses the order of cause and effect in the latter part of the passage
having worked these supernatural wonders then spoke these a donor of gifts on the lowliest beggars with equality of mind dispensing them with impartiality as the thus come one does in his field of blessings if one exercises great compassion in equal measure without seeking reward or recompense this may be called a perfectly performed bestowal
then the lowliest beggars in the city seeing these displays of supernatural power and hearing the words of doctrine that had spoken all set their minds on the attainment of
therefore i say i am not competent to visit him and ask about his illness
in this manner the various one by one described to the some past encounter with and praised the words he had spoken on that occasion and all declared that they were not competent to visit him and ask about his illness
inquiring about the illness at that time the said to you must go visit and inquire about his illness
replied to the one that eminent man is very difficult to confront
he is profoundly enlightened in the true nature of reality and skilled at preaching the essentials of the law
his eloquence never falters his wisdom is free of
he understands all the rules of conduct and nothing in the secret storehouse of the is beyond his grasp
he has overcome the host of devils and himself with transcendental powers
in wisdom and expedient means he has mastered all there is to know
nevertheless in obedience to the august command i will go visit him and inquire about his illness
then the and major disciples in the assembly the and four heavenly kings all thought to themselves now these two great men and will be talking together and they will surely the wonderful that time eight thousand five hundred and hundreds and thousands of heavenly beings all decided at once that they would like to accompany on his visit
with this throng of major disciples and heavenly beings surrounding and accompanying him proceeded to enter the city of
at that time the rich man thought to himself now is coming with that great once he employed his supernatural powers to empty the room clearing it of all its contents and his attendants leaving only a single bed on which he lay in sickness
when entered the house he saw that the room was bare of contents with just one bed lying alone on it
said welcome you come without the marks of coming you see me without the marks of seeing me
said just so layman
what has already come can hardly be coming
and what has already departed can hardly be departing
what do i mean what comes has nowhere it comes from what departs has nowhere it goes and what is seen can not be further seenl but let us put that aside for the moment
layman this illness of you endure it is the treatment perhaps not making it worse rather than better the one countless times has made solicitous inquiries concerning you
layman what is the cause of this illness has it been with you long and how can it be cured replied this illness of mine is born of ignorance and feelings of attachment
because all living beings are sick therefore i am sick
if all living beings are relieved of sickness then my sickness will be mended
why because the for the sake of living beings enters the realm of birth and death and because he is in the realm of birth and death he suffers illness
if living beings can gain release from illness then the will no longer be ill it is like the case of a rich man who has only one child
if the child falls ill then the father and mother too will be ill but if the illness is cured the father and mother too will be cured
the is like this for he loves living beings as though they were his children
if living beings are sick the will be sick but if living beings are cured the too will be cured
you ask what cause this illness arises illness of the arises from his great compassion
and do a brief pas de deux on the theme of before entering on their main dialogue
said layman why is this room empty and without attendants replied the lands of the too are all empty why are they empty they are empty because of emptiness replied
and why is emptiness empty asked
it is empty of distinctions therefore it is empty was the reply
can emptiness itself be the subject of distinctions asked
distinctions too are empty was the reply
how then is emptiness to be sought asked
it may be sought in the erroneous views of the was the reply how are the views to be sought asked
they may be sought in the emancipation of the was the reply
and how is the emancipation of the to be sought asked
it may be sought in the minds and actions of all living beings replied
and you asked why i am without attendants
but in fact the whole host of devils and the believers are all my attendants
why because the host of devils delight in the realm of birth and death and while the is in the realm of birth and death he does not scorn their company
the believers delight in various views of reality and the knows how to remain unmoved by such views
said this illness of yours form does it take my illness has no form replied
it can not be seen
said is this illness seated in the body or in the mind it is not seated in the body for it is apart from bodily form replied
and it is not seated in the mind for the mind is a thing
of the four major elements earth water fire and wind to which of these elements does this illness pertain asked
replied this illness does not pertain to the element earth but neither is it separated from the element earth
and the same may be said of the elements water fire and wind
yet the illnesses of living beings arise from the four elements
and because living beings have these illnesses therefore i too am ill then asked how should a go about comforting and instructing another who is ill replied tell him about the of the body but do not tell him to despise or turn away from the body
tell him about the sufferings of the body but do not tell him to strive for nirvana
tell him that the body is without ego but urge him to teach and guide living beings
tell him of the emptiness of the body but do not tell him of its final extinction
tell him to repent of former offenses but do not tell him to consign them to the past
tell him to use his own illness as a means of sympathizing with the illness of others for he should understand their sufferings throughout the countless of their past existence and should think how he can bring benefit to all living beings
tell him to recall the good fortune he has won through religious practice to concentrate on a life of purity and not to give way to gloom or worry
he should cultivate constant diligence striving to become a king of physicians who can heal the ailments of the assembly
this is how a should comfort and instruct a who is ill so as to make him feel happy said layman how should a who is ill go about and controlling his mind replied a who is ill should think to himself now these illnesses of mine all spring from the deluded thoughts the thinking and various earthly desires of my past existence
they have no real existence so who is it who suffers illness why the four major elements come together and therefore we apply a makeshift name calling the thing a body
but the four major elements have no master and the body has no i or ego
and these illnesses too all arise from attachment to ego
therefore i should harbor no such attachment to ego
once one has understood the origin of illness one may do away with the thought of an i or ego and the thought of other living beings
to do so one should call up the thought of phenomena thinking to oneself it is simply that various phenomena have come together to form this body
it has appeared simply because phenomena appeared and it will vanish simply because phenomena vanish
and these phenomena are none of them known to one another
when they appear they do not say i have appeared and when they vanish they do not say i have vanished then in order to wipe out the thought of phenomena the ailing should think to himself this thought or concept of phenomena too is a form of thinking and thinking can lead to great misfortune
i must rid myself of it
but how to rid myself of it by ridding myself of thoughts of i and mine which means ridding myself of dualism
what is meant by ridding oneself of dualism it means not thinking of phenomena as internal or external but treating all as equal
what is meant by equal it means that i and nirvana are treated as equal
why because i and nirvana are both empty
why are they empty because they are mere names hence empty neither of these two phenomena has any fixed nature or characteristics
once one has acquired this kind of equal outlook one will be freed of all other illness and will have only the illness of emptiness and the illness of emptiness too is empty
this ailing of ours has no sensations of pain or pleasure and yet he allows himself to feel such sensations and while the law of the is incompletely practiced he does not seek to wipe out such sensations in himself and gain entry into final enlightenment
if he feels pain in his body he thinks of the living beings in the evil realms of existence and summons up a mind of great compassion saying to himself i have regulated and controlled myself and now i must regulate and control other living beings but he should simply rid them of their illnesses and not deprive them of anything merely teaching and guiding them so they can cut off the source of illness
what is meant by the source of illness it means having troublesome
where there are troublesome these become the source of illness
what are these troublesome tied to they are tied to the threefold world
and how does one cut them off by realizing that there is nothing to grasp at
if one ceases to grasp at anything there will be no more troublesome
what is meant by realizing there is nothing to grasp at it means having done with views
what is meant by views it means viewing this as internal or viewing that as external
have done with such views and there will be no more grasping at things
this is how the ailing should go about regulating and controlling his mind
by doing so he cuts off the sufferings of old age sickness and death
if he fails to do so then all his religious practice and accomplishment in the past will be void of wisdom or profit
a person who has overcome a sworn enemy deserves to be called a hero
in the same way one who has cut off both old age sickness and death may be called a
this ailing should also think to himself this illness of mine has no reality no existence and the illnesses of other living beings likewise have no reality and no existence when he adopts this view if he should conceive a great compassion that is marked by affection and concern for living beings he should at once thrust it aside
why because the must rid himself of all earthly passions caused by external when he summons up his great compassion
if his compassion is marked by affection and concern then he will have feelings of weariness and revulsion toward the realm of birth and death
but if he can put aside affection and concern he will feel no weariness and revulsion whatever realm he happens to be born into he will not be blinded by affection or concern
he is not bound by the conditions of his birth and hence he is able to preach the law for living beings and liberate them from their bonds
as the has said if one is in bonds himself to suppose he can free others from their bonds is hardly reasonable
but if one is himself free of bonds it is perfectly reasonable to assume he can free the bonds of others
therefore the must not conjure up bonds for himself
what is meant by bonds and what is meant by liberation to become with the taste of meditation is the bondage of the
to be born in this world as a form of expedient means is the liberation of the
wisdom without expedient means is bondage wisdom with expedient means is liberation
expedient means without wisdom is bondage expedient means with wisdom is liberation
in this passage wisdom stands for the correct mental attitude of the in his efforts to lead others to enlightenment and expedient means stands for the actual methods he employs
the process of liberation or enlightenment is successfully completed only when both attitude and method are correct
what is meant by saying that wisdom without expedient means is bondage it means that with a mind full of affection and concern a sets about to adorn the lands lead numerous living beings to them and regulate himself with the doctrines of emptiness and
this is called the bondage of wisdom without expedient means
what is meant by saying that wisdom with expedient means is liberation it means that with a mind free of affection and concern a sets about to adorn the lands lead numerous living beings to them and regulate himself with the doctrines of emptiness and never experiencing weariness or revulsion
this is called the liberation of wisdom with expedient means
what is meant by saying that expedient means without wisdom is bondage it means that while dwelling among the various earthly passions such as greed anger and erroneous views a sets about planting many roots of virtue
this is called the bondage of expedient means without wisdom
what is meant by saying that expedient means with wisdom is liberation it means that while removing himself from the various earthly passions such as greed anger and erroneous views a sets about planting many roots of virtue bending all his efforts in the direction of
this is called the liberation of expedient means with wisdom
the ailing should view all phenomena in this way
and he should view the body and realize that it is marked by suffering emptiness and absence of ego
this is called wisdom
but though his body may be ailing he should constantly abide in the realm of birth and death bringing benefit to all living beings and never giving in to weariness or revulsion
this is called expedient means
he should further view the body and realize that the body is never rid of illness that illness is never rid of the body and that this body and this illness are neither prior nor posterior to one another
this is called wisdom
but though his body is ailing the never seeks escape into eternal extinction
this is called expedient means
the ailing should regulate his mind by not dwelling in such regulation but he should not dwell in of the mind either
why because if he dwells in of the mind this is the way of a stupid person
but if he dwells in regulation of the mind this is the way of a
therefore the should dwell neither in regulation nor in of the mind
to remove himself from such is the practice of the
to be in the realm of birth and death without following its tainted ways to dwell in nirvana while not seeking eternal is the practice of the
the practice that is neither that of common mortals nor that of and is the practice of the

when spoke these words eight thousand heavenly sons in the great assembly led by all set their minds on attaining
beyond comprehension at that time observing that there were no seats in room thought to himself all these and major are they going to sit the rich man knowing what was in his mind said to did you come here for the sake of the law or are you just looking for a place to sit i came for the law not for a seat said
ah said a seeker of the law concern himself even about life or limb much less about a seat a seeker of the law seeks nothing in the way of form perception conception volition or consciousness he seeks nothing in the way of or he seeks nothing in the threefold world of desire form and
ah a seeker of the law does not seek it through attachment to the does not seek it through attachment to the law does not seek it through attachment to the order
a seeker of the law does not seek it through recognition of suffering does not seek it through renunciation of attachments does not seek it through realization of how to end attachments or through practice of the wayl why because the law has nothing to do with idle theorizing
to declare that one must recognize suffering attachments realize how to reach extinction and practice the way is mere idle theorizing not seeking the law
these are the four noble truths that existence is suffering that suffering is caused by craving or attachment that there is a way to end craving that it can be done through practice of the path
ah the law is called tranquil extinction
but if one strives for birth followed by extinction this is seeking birth and extinction this is not seeking the law
the law is called unstained
but if one is stained with the idea of the law or of nirvana then one is stained with attachment and this is not seeking the law
the law has no goal of activity but if one actively pursues the law one is pursuing a goal and this is not seeking the law
the law knows no picking and choosing but if one picks and chooses the law this is picking and choosing not seeking the law
the law is independent of place but if one on the idea of place this is with place not a seeking of the law the law is called
if one tries to know it through form this is seeking form not seeking the law
the law is not something that can be resided in
if one tries to reside in it this is trying to reside in the law not seeking the law
the law is not something that can be seen heard perceived or understood
if one tries to see hear perceive and understand it this is trying to see hear perceive and understand the law not seeking the law
the law is called unconditioned
if one tries to approach it through the conditioned this is seeking the conditioned not seeking the law therefore if one would be a seeker of the law one must not seek it in anything at all
when spoke these words five hundred heavenly sons gained the purity of the eye in their perception of phenomena
at that time the rich man said to you have visited countless thousands ten thousands billions of of countries
what lands have the finest and most beautiful lion seats those endowed with the best replied layman to the east beyond countries numerous as the sands of lies a world called shape
its is named lamp king and he is there now this body is thousand in height and the lion seat he sits on is thousand high and adorned in the finest fashion
the rich man then exercised his transcendental powers and at once that dispatched thousand lion seats tall broad adorned and pure and had them brought into room where the major disciples four heavenly kings and the others saw something they had never seen before
for the room was broad and spacious enough to hold all these thousand lion seats without the slightest crowding or
the city of and and the other of the four continents too seemed in no way or but all appeared just as usual
at that time said to sit down in one of the lion seats the and other distinguished persons should also sit down but when they do so they should assume bodies to the size of the seat
the who had acquired transcendental powers thereupon immediately transformed their shapes making themselves tall and sat down in the lion seats
but among the who had newly embarked on their course or the major disciples there were none who could climb up into the seats
at that time said to sit down in a lion seat but said layman these seats are too tall and cant climb up in them said ah if you will make to the thus come one lamp king then you will be able to take a seat
the who had newly embarked on their course and the major disciples accordingly made to the thus come one lamp king and after that they were able to seat themselves in the lion seats
said layman i have never seen such a thing a little room like this and still it can hold seats as tall and broad as these and the city of is in no way crowded or obstructed nor are any of the towns or villages of or of the other of the four continents or or the palaces of the heavenly beings dragon kings and spirits i said ah the and have an emancipation that is called beyond comprehension
when a dwells in this emancipation he can take something as tall and broad as mount and put it inside a mustard seed without enlarging one or shrinking the other and mount king of mountains will still have its original shape
moreover the four heavenly kings and the gods of the heaven who live on mount will not even know or realize where they have gone to
only those destined for enlightenment will be able to see that has been put inside a mustard seed
this is called dwelling in the doctrine of the emancipation beyond comprehension
or again this can take the waters of the four great oceans and pour them into the opening that holds a single hair without the fish turtles sea turtles lizards or other sea creatures being in any way troubled and those great seas will still have their original form
and the dragons spirits and others who live in the sea will not know or realize where they have gone to and these beings will not be at all troubled
or again this who dwells in the emancipation beyond comprehension can slice off the world grasp it in the palm of his right hand like a potters wheel and toss it beyond lands numerous as the sands of the and the beings in that world will not know or realize where they have gotten to
the can then bring it back and put it in its original place and none of the people will have any idea they have gone somewhere and come back and the world will have the same shape as before
again suppose there are beings who want to live in this world for a long time but are qualified to enter enlightenment
this can stretch seven days into a so that to those beings they really seem like a whole
or if there are beings who do not want to live in this world for long and they are qualified to enter enlightenment this can squeeze a into seven days so that to those beings it seems like only seven days
again the who dwells in the emancipation beyond comprehension can take the magnificent from all the lands gather them together and show them to the beings living in a single country or this can place all the beings of a single land in the palm of his right hand and fly with them all around the ten directions showing them everything and yet never move from his original spot
or this can take all the objects offered to the by the beings in the worlds in the ten directions and make them all visible within a pore that holds a single hair or take all the suns moon stars and constellations that belong to the worlds in the ten directions and make them visible within the pore of a single hair or he can suck into his mouth all the winds from the worlds in the ten directions without doing any harm to himself or breaking down the trees that grow there
or when the worlds in the ten directions come to the end of the and everything is destroyed by fire he can take all those fires and hold them in his belly and though the fires go on burning as before the suffers no harm
or he can go down into the lower region past lands numerous as the sands of the pick up one land and lift it to the upper region above lands numerous as the sands of the as one would lift the leaf of a tree on the point of a needle and that land will be in no way troubled
or the who dwells in the emancipation beyond comprehension can use his transcendental powers to make himself appear in the body of a or the body of a or that of a an a king one of the four heavenly kings or a king
or again he can take all the voices uttered by the beings in the worlds of the ten directions high middle and sounds and transform them all into the voice of the
he can make these voices discourse with the sounds of suffering emptiness or or all the various other doctrines preached by the of the ten directions and cause those doctrines to be heard everywhere
i have just now briefly described the powers possessed by this of the emancipation beyond comprehension
if i were to describe them in full i could go on for a whole and never have done
at that time hearing this discourse on the doctrine of the emancipation beyond comprehension sighed at what he had never heard before and said to it is like someone displaying various painted images before a blind man when he can not see them
in the same way when we hear this doctrine of the emancipation beyond comprehension we are all incapable of understanding it
if wise persons hear it there will be none who do not set their minds on attaining
but what of us who are forever cut off at the root who with regard to these great vehicle teachings have already become like rotten seed the who represent because they have taken as their goal the attainment of the state of have in effect cut themselves off at the root from the search for the higher goal of the goal of great or doctrine and practice
in terms the potential for inherent in the has become like rotten seed that will never sprout
when hear this doctrine of the emancipation beyond comprehension they will surely all cry out in anguish in voices loud enough to shake the whole world
but should all accept this teaching with great joy and thanksgiving
for if there are who put faith in this doctrine of the emancipation beyond comprehension then none of the host of devils can do anything to them when spoke these words thousand offspring of the gods set their minds on the attainment of
at that time said to sir among those who play the part of devil kings in the immeasurable of worlds in the ten directions there are many who in fact are dwelling in the emancipation beyond comprehension
they employ their skill in expedient means to teach and convert living beings by appearing in the guise of devil kings
or again with regard to the immeasurable numbers of in the ten directions sometimes people come to them begging for a hand or a foot an ear a nose a head an eye marrow or brains blood flesh skin bones or for their villages towns wives and children men and women servants elephants horses carriages or for gold coral amber pearls shell clothing food or drink
many of those who beg in this fashion are who dwell in the emancipation beyond comprehension
they employ their skill in expedient means and go to the other to test them and make sure they are firm in their resolve to give
how can they do this because the who dwell in the emancipation beyond comprehension possess powers of authority and virtue that enable them to others and make them perform difficult feats in this manner
ordinary persons of inferior type have no such powers and hence can not others as these do
they are like who can not stand up before the kicking and trampling of dragons or elephants
this is what is called the wisdom and expedient means possessed by the who dwell in the emancipation beyond comprehension
in speaking of people being for an eye or some other part of the body probably has in mind the various tales in lore of deities who take on devilish form and beg practitioners of the way for a piece of their body as a means of testing their dedication to the of
is thus suggesting that the difficulties that and the other face may in fact just be a means of testing their resolve
regarding living beings at that time asked how does the regard living beings replied as a looks on the beings he conjures does the regard living beings
as the wise view the moon in the water or a face or form seen in a mirror as of heat in a season as the echo that follows a cry as clouds in the sky as foam on the water bubbles on the water as a thing no firmer that the trunk of the plantain no longer lasting than a flash of lightning as a fifth great element a sixth component a seventh a thirteenth a nineteenth does the regard living beings
as forms in the world of as from charred grain as mistaken views of the body in one who has entered the stream that leads to the state of as a of the womb by one no longer subject to rebirth as the three poisons of greed anger and ignorance in as greed anger or violation of the precepts on the part of a who has accepted the nature of all existence as of earthly desire in a as forms seen by a blind person as the breathing in and out of one immersed in the of utter tranquility as the tracks of a bird in the sky as a child born to a barren woman as earthly desires in a phantom being as sights in a dream after one has wakened as the taking on of bodily form by one who has entered extinction as fire that has no does the regard living beings
that is as one more of each category than actually exists
said if the looks on beings in this way how can he treat them with compassion replied when the has finished regarding them in this way he thinks to himself
for the sake of living beings i must preach this law to them this is true compassion
he treats them with a compassion of tranquil extinction for it results in no birth treats them with a compassion for it is void of earthly desires treats them with a compassion that is impartial as the three of past present and future are impartial treats them with a compassion free of contention for nothing arises to oppose it treats them with a compassion for internal and external have no place in it treats them with a compassion for it carries through to the end treats them with a compassion firm and durable for the mind of the never flags treats them with a compassion clean and pure as the nature of all phenomena is pure treats them with a compassion boundless boundless as the empty sky
he treats them with the compassion of the who has conquered the thieves of desire treats them with the compassion of the who brings contentment to all beings treats them with the compassion of the thus come one who has grasped the marks of treats them with the compassion of the who awakens living beings treats them with a compassion wholly natural understanding that it is treats them with a compassion of which is of one flavor only treats them with a compassion that has no for it cuts off all favoritism treats them with great pity and compassion guiding them with the great vehicle
he treats them with a compassion that never seeing that all is empty and without ego treats them with the compassion of bestowal of the law never in its gifts treats them with the compassion of observance of the precepts training those who break them to do better treats them with the compassion of guarding both others and self treats them with the compassion of all beings as its burden treats them with the compassion of meditation unaffected by taste treats them with the compassion of wisdom which always knows the right time treats them with the compassion of expedient means with manifestations suited to every occasion
he treats them with a compassion that hides nothing proceeding with the purity of an upright mind treats them with the compassion of a deeply searching mind one free of irrelevant motion treats them with a compassion that is unerring innocent of falsity and sham treats them with a compassion full of peace and delight for through it they gain the delight of the
such is the compassion of the
continuing his questioning asked what do you mean when you speak of pity i mean that whatever benefits the gains he shares them all with all other living beings replied
what do you mean by joy any way the can aid or enrich others he views as an occasion for joy and never for regret
what do you mean by indifference whatever blessings or good fortune the he expects nothing in return
then asked if the fears the cycle of birth and death what should he rely on replied the fearing the cycle of birth and death should rely on the power of the blessings
if he hopes to rely on the power of the blessings what course should he pursue compassion pity joy and constitute the four immeasurable qualities
see glossary
if he hopes to rely on the power of the blessings he should devote himself to saving and liberating all living beings
if he hopes to save living beings what must he free them from if he hopes to save living beings he must free them from earthly desires
if he hopes to free them from earthly desires how should he proceed he should proceed by the method of correct
how does one proceed by the method of correct one proceeds on the premise of no birth and no extinction
what has no birth and what has no extinction the not good has no birth the good has no extinction
what is the root of good and not good the body is the root
what is the root of the body desire and greed are the root
what is the root of desire and greed false and empty distinctions are the root
what is the root of false and empty distinctions thinking is the root
what is the root of thinking groundless assumptions are the root of thinking
what is the root of groundless assumptions what is groundless can have no root
it is on the root of this that all the other concepts are built up
at that time there was a heavenly being a goddess in room who seeing these great men and hearing them the law proceeded to make herself visible and taking heavenly flowers scattered them over the and major disciples
when the flowers touched the they all fell to the floor at once but when they touched the major disciples they stuck to them and did not fall off
the disciples all tried to shake off the flowers through their supernatural powers but they could not do so
at that time the goddess said to why try to brush off the flowers such flowers are not in accordance with the law he replied
why i try to brush them off
the goddess said say these flowers are not in accordance with the law
why because the flowers make no such distinctions
you in your thinking have made up these distinctions all
if one who has left the household life to follow the law makes such distinctions that is not in accordance with the law
one must be without distinctions to be in accordance with the law look at the flowers do not stick to them because they have already cut off all thought of distinctions
just as evil spirits are able to take advantage of a person who is beset by fear so because you disciples are fearful of the cycle of birth and death the senses of form sound smell taste and touch are able to take advantage of you
but once a person has done away with fear then the five desires that arise from these senses will not be able to get at him
so long as one has not done away with all such the flowers will stick to him
but they will not stick to someone who has eliminated them all
said goddess have you been staying in this room long she replied venerable sir my stay in this room is about as long as your attainment of emancipation
the wearing of flowers or other personal ornaments was forbidden to members of the order
said so been here a long time venerable sir said the goddess how long has your attainment of emancipation been was silent and did not answer
the goddess said with your great wisdom venerable sir why do you remain silent replied emancipation can not be spoken of in words
therefore i do not know what i can say to you
the goddess said words writing all are marks of emancipation
why because emancipation is not internal not external and not in between
and words likewise are not internal not external and not in between
therefore you can speak of emancipation without putting words aside
why because all things that exist are marks of emancipation
said emancipation mean putting aside anger and stupidity the goddess said the addressing persons of overbearing arrogance asserted that one must put aside anger and stupidity in order to gain emancipation that is all
if he was addressing those who were free of overbearing arrogance the asserted that the nature of anger and stupidity is emancipation itself
said excellent excellent goddess what have you seized on what have you seen into that you speak with such eloquence the goddess replied i have seized on nothing seen into nothing and hence speak with eloquence
why if one claims to have seized on something or seen into something then in the light of the law one is being arrogant
asked the goddess of the three vehicles which do you pursue the goddess replied i use the law of the to convert living beings and therefore i practice the way of the
i use the law of causes and conditions to convert living beings and therefore i practice the way of the
i use the law of great pity to convert living beings and therefore i practice the great vehicle
when one enters a grove of trees one smells only the odor of the and does not smell any other odor
and in the same way when one enters this room one smells only the fragrance of the blessings but takes no delight in smelling the fragrance of the or the blessings these four heavenly kings heavenly beings dragons spirits and others who have entered this room and listen to this great man the correct law all delight in the fragrance of the blessings and leave with their minds set on attaining them
i have been staying in this room for twelve years and never from the first have i heard any expounding of the law of the or the
i have heard only of the great compassion and great pity of the the law of the that is beyond comprehension
this room constantly eight rare and unprecedented phenomena
what are these eight this room is constantly flooded with rays of golden light that never change day or night
it is not lit by the shining of the sun or moon
this is the first rare and unprecedented phenomenon
those who enter this room are never troubled by
this is the second rare and unprecedented phenomenon
in this room four heavenly kings and from other regions constantly come together in a gathering that never ends
this is the third rare and unprecedented phenomenon
in this room there is constant exposition of the six and the wheel of the law
this is the fourth rare and unprecedented phenomenon
in this room heavenly beings constantly make superlative music and from their strings come forth the sounds of immeasurable persuasions
this is the fifth rare and unprecedented phenomenon
in this room are four great storehouses stacked high with varied treasures to relieve the destitute and rescue those in want a supply to be drawn on yet never exhausted
this is the sixth rare and unprecedented phenomenon
when this great man turns his thoughts to them jeweled virtue jeweled flame jeweled moon jeweled majesty hard to surpass lion echo all and countless other such from the ten directions come at once to this room and broadly the secret and essential teachings the storehouse of the
and when they have finished expounding they return to where they came from
this is the seventh rare and unprecedented phenomenon
within this room the magnificently adorned palaces of all the heavenly beings and the pure lands of the various are all to be seen
this is the eighth rare and unprecedented phenomenon
these are the eight rare and unprecedented phenomena
who seeing these sights beyond belief would still delight in the law of the said why you change out of this female body the goddess replied for the past twelve years i have been trying to take on female form but in the end with no success
what is there to change if a were to conjure up a phantom woman and then someone asked her why she change out of her female body would that be any kind of reasonable question no said
have no fixed form so what would there be to change assumes that any woman would naturally want to change into a man if she had the power to do so
the goddess said all things are just the have no fixed form
so why ask why i change out of my female form at that time the goddess employed her supernatural powers to change into a goddess like herself while she took on form
then she asked why you change out of this female body now in the form of a goddess replied i know why i have suddenly changed and taken on a female body the goddess said if you can change out of this female body then all women can change likewise
who is not a woman appears in a body
and the same is true of all they appear in bodies they are not women
therefore the teaches that all phenomena are neither male nor female
then the goddess withdrew her supernatural powers and returned to his original form
the goddess said to where now is the form and shape of your female body said the form and shape of my female body does not exist yet does not not exist
the goddess said all things are just like do not exist yet do not not exist
and that they do not exist yet do not not exist is exactly what the teaches
said to the goddess when your present existence comes to an end where will you be reborn the goddess replied the way the is born in his transformation how ill be born
said when the is born in his transformation body it is not a matter of birth or death
the takes on a transformation body when he appears in one of the lower realms of existence in order to guide and instruct the beings there
see glossary under three bodies
the goddess said its that way with living beings are without birth or death
said to the goddess how long will it be before you attain the goddess replied when you revert to the state of a common mortal then i will succeed in gaining
said it is unthinkable that i should become a common mortal again the goddess said it is likewise unthinkable that i should attain
why because is nothing to be thought about hence nothing to be attained
said the who are now attaining and those who have attained it in the past and will attain it in the future numerous as the sands of the would you say of all those the goddess said we use the numbers of everyday language and so we speak of all those as belonging to the three of past present and future
but this is not to say that knows anything of past present and future
 then the goddess said have you attained the way of the said realized there is nothing to be attained so attained it
the goddess said the and are that too
realized there is nothing to attain and so attained it
at this time said to this goddess has in the past made offerings to million and can herself with the supernatural powers of a
she has fulfilled all that she vowed has accepted the truth of and dwells in a state from which she will never
because of her original vow she can show herself anytime she and teach and convert living beings
the way at that time asked how does the go about mastering the way said the should follow a path that is not the he can master the way
asked how does the follow a path that is not the way replied if the goes to the region of the five sins that lead to the hell of incessant suffering he shows no anguish or anger
he arrives in hell but is free of offense or
he arrives in the realm of beasts but without the faults of stupidity or arrogance
he arrives in the realm of the hungry spirits yet is fully endowed with merits
he goes to the world of form and the world of but makes no boast of this
he shows greed and desire in his actions yet is removed from the stains of attachment
he shows anger in his actions yet has no anger or aversion toward living beings
he appears to be stupid but utilizes wisdom to regulate his mind
he appears stingy and grasping yet both inner and outer possessions neither body nor life
he appears to break the but in fact resides secure in the pure precepts and even then remains fearful of committing the smallest fault
he seems angry and yet is at all times compassionate and he seems indolent and lazy yet works diligently to acquire merit
he seems disordered in thought yet constantly practices meditation
he seems stupid yet has mastered both worldly and otherworldly wisdom
he appears fawning and deceitful but is skilled in expedient means and faithful to the doctrines
he appears haughty and arrogant yet serves as a bridge and a crossing for living beings
he appears to be immersed in earthly desires but his mind is at all times clear and pure
we see him going among devils yet he abides by the wisdom and no other teachings
we see him going among but to living beings he preaches a law never heard before
we see him going among but he great pity in teaching and converting living beings
he seems to be among the poor and destitute yet he has jeweled hands capable of inexhaustible benefits
he seems to be crippled and yet possesses auspicious features himself wonderfully with them
he seems to be humble and lowly yet is born into the seed and lineage of the fully endowed with blessings
he seems to be among the puny and emaciated the ugly and vile yet acquires the body of a a delight for all beings to seel he seems to be old and ailing yet has forever cut off the roots of illness and transcended the fear of death
he appears to possess wealth but habitually regards it as transient and in fact none of it
he seems to have wives and waiting women yet never himself in the bog of the five desires
he seems and clumsy in speech yet commands great eloquence and retains all he has learned forgetting nothing
though appearing to employ unorthodox methods of salvation he follows the correct teaching in saving living beings
he appears to enter all the different paths of existence yet cuts himself off from their influence
he appears to have entered nirvana yet never cuts himself off from the realm of birth and death
an incarnation of incorporated into as a guardian noted for his heroic strength and stature
by going to places that are the opposite of the way in this fashion the is able to master the way
than asked what may act as the seeds of the thus come one that is the seeds leading to enlightenment or
said the body is the seed ignorance and are the seeds greed anger and stupidity are the seeds
the four views are the seeds the five are the seeds the six are the seeds the seven of consciousness are the seeds the eight errors are the seeds the nine sources of anxiety are the seeds the ten evil actions are the seeds
to sum it up the erroneous views and all the different kinds of earthly desires are all the seeds of the
what do you mean by that replied a person who has perceived the nature of reality and entered into correct understanding can not again set his mind on attaining
the lotus does not grow on the upland plain the lotus grows in the mud and of a damp place
in the same way the law can never grow in a person who has perceived the nature of reality and entered into correct understanding
it is only when living beings are in the midst of the of earthly desires that they turn to the law
if you plant seeds in the sky they will never grow
only when you plant them in soil can they sprout and flourish
in the same way the law will never grow in a person who has perceived the nature of reality and entered into correct understanding
but one who views as huge as mount can still set his mind on the attainment of
from this you should understand the various earthly desires are the seeds of the thus come one
if you do not descend into the vast ocean you can never acquire a priceless pearl in the same way if you do not enter the great sea of earthly desires you can never acquire the treasure of comprehensive wisdom
y at that time sighed and said excellent excellent these words are aptly spoken
it is indeed just as you say
those who are troubled by the passions are the seeds of the thus come one
but persons such as us the voice hearers are now no longer capable of setting our minds on the attainment of
even those who have committed the five sins that lead to the hell of incessant suffering can still rouse aspirations that will afford growth to the law
but now we can never rouse such aspirations
we are like persons whose faculties are impaired and can no longer satisfy the five desires
the who have cut off all are like this for they can no longer fit from the law nor will they ever have the desire to
in this sense the common mortal responds with gratitude to the law but the does not
why do i say this because when the common mortal hears the law he can set his mind on attaining the unsurpassed way determined that the three treasures shall never perish
but the may hear of the law and powers and to the end of his life and yet never be capable of rousing in himself an aspiration for the unsurpassed way
at that time there was in the assembly a named universally manifested physical body who asked layman your father and mother wife and children relatives retainers clerks people and are they your maids and men servants your elephants horses and are they replied with the following verses wisdom is the mother expedient means his father of those who guide and teach all beings there are none not born of these
joy is his wife pity and compassion of mind are his daughters the good mind and sincerity his sons final emptiness and tranquility his dwelling
for disciples he has the many dusts and passions they follow the dictates of his will
the elements of the way are his good friends through them he gains correct enlightenment
the are his companions the four methods of winning others his singing girls
for songs they the words of the such is the music made for him
in the garden of full retention of the teachings grow the trees of the law free of
their wonderful blossoms are the seven factors of enlightenment their fruit emancipation and wisdom
on the of the eight with clear waters of meditation spread the of the seven those who bathe there are spotless
his elephants and horses race the five roads of transcendental power for chariot he has the great vehicle
controlling directing with the single mind he travels the path

when the various had finished one by one giving their explanations they asked how then does the enter the gate of replied to my way of thinking all are without words without explanations without purport without removed from all questions and answers
in this way one may enter the gate of
then said to each of us has given an explanation
now sir it is your turn to speak
how does the enter the gate of at that time remained silent and did not speak a word
sighed and said excellent excellent not a word not a truly is to enter the gate of when this chapter on entering the gate of was preached five thousand in the assembly were all able to enter the gate of and to learn to accept the truth of
fragrance accumulated at that time thought to himself it is almost noon
what are all these going to eat then knowing what was in his mind said the preached the eight
you sir should undertake to practice them
why be distracted by thoughts of eating when you are listening to the law if you want something to eat wait a moment
i will see that you get the sort of food you have never had before then entered and employing his transcendental powers showed the great assembly a country called many fragrances situated in a region high above beyond lands as numerous as the sands of
the named fragrance accumulated was at that time present there
the fragrance of his country was finer than the fragrance of all the human and heavenly realms of the lands of the ten directions
in his land there was not even the term or but only great pure and clean for whom the preached the law
all the inhabitants of his world built their halls and towers out of fragrances strolled the fragrant ground and had gardens all made of fragrances
the fragrant aroma of their food to immeasurable worlds in the ten directions
at this time the and the various were just sitting down together to eat
heavenly offspring all named fragrant garland all with their minds set on attaining were serving the meal to the and the
among the great assembly gathered at house there were none who could not see these things with their own eyes
then addressed the saying who among you can bring us some of that food out of deference to authority and supernatural powers however all of them remained silent
addressing said sir a great assembly such as is shameful is it not replied as the has told us never despise those who have yet to learn
thereupon without rising from his seat but in the presence of the whole gathering conjured up a phantom whose auspicious features shining brightness authority and virtue were so superior that they the entire group
then he announced to this you must go to the region high above beyond lands numerous as the sands of where there is a country called many fragrances
the named fragrance accumulated is just now sitting down with his to a meal
when you arrive in his presence speak as i instruct you saying bows his head before the feet of the one with immeasurable reverence and begs to inquire if in your daily activities your illnesses are few your worries are few does your strength suffice you he desires to obtain the from this meal of the one so he may carry out the work by dispensing them in the world enabling those who delight in a lesser doctrine to be broadened by the great way and also to cause the thus come ones fame to be heard on all sides
at that time this conjured in the presence of the gathering ascended to the region high above
everyone in the entire assembly could see him as he departed and as he arrived in the world called many fragrances and made his at the feet of the there
and they could hear him say bows his head before the feet of the one with immeasurable reverence and begs to inquire if in your daily activities your illnesses are few your worries are few
does your strength suffice you he desires to obtain the from this meal of the one so he may carry out the work by dispensing them in the world ensuring that those who delight in a lesser doctrine will be broadened by the great way and also that the thus come ones fame may be heard on all sides
when the great men of the country many fragrances saw this conjured they sighed at seeing what they had never seen before and said where has this superior being come from the is that what is this thing he calls doctrine when they had put these questions to their the announced to them in the lower region beyond lands as numerous as the sands of there is a world called
the named is at present manifesting himself in that evil world of the five impurities in order to the teachings of the way to living beings who delight in a lesser doctrine
he has a named who dwells in the emancipation beyond comprehension and preaches the law for the other
he has purposely dispatched this phantom being to come and my name and praise this land so that thereby he may bring increased benefits to those
the said how can this man conjure up a phantom such as this does he possess such strength of virtue such such transcendental powers the inhabitants of the country many fragrances as we have been told earlier have never even heard of or
the replied his powers are great indeed he dispatches in all the ten directions to carry out the work and bring enrichment to living beings
then the thus come one fragrance accumulated took a bowl of many fragrances filled it with fragrant rice and gave it to the phantom
at that time the nine million all spoke out in unison saying we wish to visit that world and offer to
and we also wish to see and the many other
you may go said the
but draw in your bodily fragrances so that you will not cause living beings to be deluded or beguiled by them
and you should put aside your real form so that the persons in that country who are striving to become will not feel intimidated or ashamed
and you must not look on that land with disdain or contempt or rouse thoughts that obstruct progress
why because all the lands in the ten directions are as empty as the sky
it is just that since the wish to convert those who delight in a lesser doctrine they do not reveal the full purity of the land
at that time the phantom having received the bowl of rice joined the nine million and all relying upon the might and supernatural power of the and upon power suddenly vanished from that world and then in the space of an instant arrived at house
immediately conjured up nine million lion seats beautifully adorned like the ones that were already there and the all sat down in them
the then presented the bowl filled with fragrant rice to
the fragrance of the rice perfumed the entire city of and the whole world
the lay believers and others of smelling this fragrant aroma were delighted in body and mind sighing with admiration at something they had never known before
at that time moon canopy a leader among the rich men accompanied by thousand persons came to house
seeing the vast number of gathered in the room and the lion seats tall broad and beautifully adorned they were filled with delight
after paying to the and the major disciples they retired and stood to one side
various earth deities sky deities and heavenly beings of the world of desire and the world of form smelling the fragrant aroma all likewise came to house
then said to and the other great come eat this rice from the thus come one delicious as sweet dew it is with the odor of great pity
but you must not eat it in a manner or you will never digest it some of the other thought to themselves there is only a little can it feed all the people in this great assembly but the phantom said do not try to use your petty virtue and petty wisdom in appraising the immeasurable blessings and wisdom of the thus come one though the four seas run dry this rice will never come to an end
every person here could eat the size of mount and do so for a whole but still it would never be exhausted
why because this is the from a meal eaten by persons who have acquired inexhaustible merits through the precepts meditation wisdom emancipation and the insight of emancipation
therefore it can never be exhausted
the rice in the bowl was then used to feed to satisfaction all the members of the assembly yet it remained as it was without any sign of depletion
the and heavenly and human beings who ate the rice had a sense of bodily ease and delight of mind the in the country of all delights and
and a wonderful fragrance emanated from the pores of all of them like the fragrance of the trees in the called many fragrances
at that time asked the from the country many fragrances how does the thus come one fragrance accumulated preach the law the replied the thus come one in our land does not employ words in his exposition
he just uses various fragrances to induce heavenly and human beings to undertake the observance of the precepts
each sits under a fragrant tree and when he smells the marvelous fragrance he immediately attains the known as the storehouse of all virtues
persons who are able to attain this all become endowed with the blessings of a
the then asked now how does the one preach the law replied the living beings of this land are stubborn and and hard to convert
therefore the uses strong language when preaching to them in order to tame and control them
he says this is hell this is the realm of beasts this is the realm of hungry spirits these are the difficult conditions this is the place where stupid people are born
these are misdeeds of the body these are the retribution for misdeeds of the body
these are misdeeds of the mouth these are the retribution for misdeeds of the mouth
these are misdeeds of the mind these are the retribution for misdeeds of the mind
this is the killing of living beings this is the retribution for killing living beings
this is taking what has not been given to you this is the retribution for taking what has not been given to you
this is sexual this is the retribution for sexual
this is lying this is the retribution for lying
this is being this is the retribution for being
this is harsh speech this is the retribution for harsh speech
this is specious talk this is the retribution for specious talk
this is greed this is the retribution for greed
this is wrath this is the retribution for wrath
these are erroneous views this is the retribution for erroneous views
this is this is the retribution for
this is breaking the precepts this is the retribution for breaking the precepts
this is anger this is the retribution for anger
this is this is the retribution for
this is this is the retribution for
this is stupidity this is the retribution for stupidity
this is accepting the precepts this is keeping the precepts this is violating the precepts
this is what ought to be done this is what ought not to be done
this is creating obstacles this is not creating obstacles
this is incurring blame this is avoiding blame
this is purity this is
this is to have this is to be free of
this is the wrong way this is the correct way
this is the conditioned this is the unconditioned
this is the mundane world this is nirvana
these people who are difficult to convert have minds like monkeys
therefore one must resort to various methods in order to control and regulate their minds
only then can they be and made obedient
it is like dealing with an elephant or horse that is wild and unruly one must apply sharp blows till it feels them in its bones and then it can be
and it is the same with these stubborn and beings who are difficult to convert
therefore one uses all sorts of bitter and piercing words and then they can be made to observe the precepts
when those had finished listening to this explanation they all exclaimed we have never heard of such a thing before a one like who conceals his immeasurable powers of freedom and preaches the law in a manner that will please the mean in spirit in order to save and liberate all beings and these zealous of them in their immeasurably great pity to to be born in this land said the of this land are indeed in their great pity for all living beings
it is just as you have said
and the enrichment and benefit they bring to living beings in one lifetime here is greater than that bestowed in other worlds over the space of a hundred thousand
why because in this world there are ten good practices that do not exist in any of those pure lands
what are these ten which does away with poverty and
pure precepts which do away with violation of the
which does away with anger
which does away with
meditation which does away with of mind
wisdom which does away with stupidity
the explanation of how to remove oneself from difficulties which saves those who face the eight difficulties
the doctrine of the great vehicle which saves those who delight in the lesser vehicle
the cultivation of good roots which those who are lacking in virtue
and the four ways of winning people which are constantly employed to guide living beings to success
these are the ten
the said what methods must these carry out in their practices in this world so that they may be born free of boils and sores in a pure land replied these must carry out eight methods in their practices in this world in order to be born free of boils and sores in a pure land
what are these eight they must enrich and benefit living beings but look for no recompense
they must take upon themselves the sufferings of all living beings and what merit they acquire thereby shall all be a gift to those beings
in mind they must be like other living beings themselves descending to their level erecting no barriers
they shall regard other as though they were looking at the himself
when they hear a they have not heard before they shall not doubt it and they shall not dispute with or oppose the
they shall not envy the received by others nor boast of their own gains
in carrying out these methods they must regulate and control their minds constantly reflecting on their own faults and not the shortcomings of others
at all times they shall with a single mind strive to acquire merits
these are the eight methods
that is free of physical ills or defects
such ills would indicate that the religious practice had been faulty
when and expounded these teachings to the great assembly a hundred thousand heavenly and human beings all set their minds on attaining and ten thousand were able to accept the truth of
actions of the at that time the was in the gardens preaching the law when the ground suddenly became broad and beautifully adorned and all the persons assembled there took on a golden color
said to the one what is the reason for this auspicious sign the area has become suddenly broadened and adorned and the members of the assembly have all taken on a golden color the said to and surrounded by a great gathering of persons have decided to come here
therefore this auspicious sign has first of all appeared
at that moment said to let us go together to see the and join the in paying and making offerings
said excellent we will go indeed
this is just the time to do so
employing his supernatural powers proceeded to pick up the whole great assembly along with their lion seats place them in the palm of his right hand and journey with them to the place where the was
after arriving there and them on the ground he bowed his head at the feet of the circled to the right performing seven of the and pressing his palms together with a single mind stood to one side
the all immediately left their seats bowed their heads at the feet performed seven and stood to one side
the major disciples and four heavenly kings all likewise left their seats bowed their heads at the feet and stood to one side
then the after making the customary greetings and inquiries sent them back to their seats
after all of them following his instructions had settled again in their seats the said to did you see what these these great men did through their freely exercised supernatural powers yes i saw it
and what did you think of it one what i saw them do was incredible
my mind can not comprehend it it is beyond my at that time said to the one this fragrance i smell is like nothing i have ever known
what fragrance is this the replied to this is the fragrance that comes from the pores of these
then said to our pores too put forth this fragrance where does it come from asked
it comes from the rice left over from the meal that the rich man had brought from the country many fragrances replied
the pores of everyone who ate it at his house emit this kind of fragrance
then asked how long will this fragrant aroma last said until the rice is digested
and how long will it be before the rice is digested the power of this rice is such that it will be seven days before it is digested
moreover if who have not yet reached the stage of ultimate determination eat this rice they will be able to digest it only after they reach that stage
and if persons who have already reached that stage eat this rice they will be able to digest it only after they have gained liberation of mind
if those who have not yet set their minds on attaining the great vehicle eat this rice they will have to set their minds on that before they can digest it
if those who have already set their minds on doing so eat this rice they will have to accept the truth of before they can digest it
if those who have already accepted the truth of eat this rice they will have to advance to the place where is assured them in their next birth before they can digest it
it is like the medicine called superior flavor that remains undigested until all the poisons in the body of the person who takes it have been eliminated
this rice is the after all the poisons of earthly desires have been wiped out will it be digested
said to the i have never heard of such a thing think that this fragrant rice can be used to do the work the said just so just so
and there are some lands where the radiant light of the is used to do the work
some where are used to do the work
some where phantom beings conjured up by the are used for the work
some where the tree is used for the work
some where the garments or bedding are used for the work
some where the food is used for the work
some where gardens groves pavilions and towers are used to do the work
some where the features and eighty characteristics auspicious marks that accompany the body of the are used to do the work
some where the body is used for the work
and some where empty space is used for the work
living beings responding to these various agents are thereby led to undertake the practice of the precepts
there are lands where such as dreams reflections echoes images in a mirror the moon in the water or shimmering heat waves are used to do the work
there are some where voices spoken words or written words are used to do the work
or pure lands where tranquil silence without words without explanations without purport without without action without conditioning does the work
thus among all daily activities of the their comings and goings every act that they carry out there is not one that does not do the work
there is a gate known as the four devils and the thousand earthly desires
living beings are wearied and by these devils and desires but the use this as a method by which to do the work
this is called the gate of entry to all
who have entered this gate when they see lands replete with all manner of purity and beauty will not for that reason feel delight or longing or elation and when they see lands with all sorts of impurities they will not feel sad or vexed or downcast
they will merely regard the with renewed purity of mind experiencing a joy and reverence they have never known before
the merits of the various the thus come ones are all equal but in order to convert living beings they manifest themselves in different kinds of lands
look at the various lands
the land in them is varied but there is no variation in the sky
and it is the same when you look at the various
their physical bodies are varied but that is all
there is no variation in their wisdom
a physical body impressive features lineage precepts meditation wisdom the insight of powers properties not shared by others great compassion great pity the observance of proper demeanor as well as a fixed life span the power to preach the law to teach and convert others to lead living beings to enlightenment to purify the lands and to assimilate the law of other these are possessed equally by all the various
therefore they are called perfectly enlightened they are called thus come one they are called enlightened one
if i were to explain to you in detail the meaning of these three epithets you could live for a whole and still not hear all i have to say
even if all the living beings in the world were like you who are foremost in hearing the teachings and concentrating on and retaining all you have heard and they were to live for a whole they could not hear it all
so it is of the is beyond and their wisdom and eloquence defy comprehension
said to the from now on i will never dare think of myself as a person who has heard many of the teachings
the said to be discouraged why because when i spoke of you as foremost among the in the volume of teachings you have heard i was not speaking with the in mind
so do not take the matter to heart
no wise person should try to estimate the abilities of the
all the deepest places in the sea can still be but the meditation wisdom power to retain the teachings eloquence and all the various merits of the are immeasurable
you and the others had best forget about the actions of the
this manifestation of supernatural power that has just now shown us no or could equal in a hundred thousand no matter how he might exhaust his powers of transformation then the who had come from the world many fragrances pressed their palms together and addressed the saying one when we first saw this land we thought of it as base and inferior
but now we regret our error and have put such thoughts out of our minds
why because the expedient means employed by the are beyond comprehension
in order to save living beings they manifest different kinds of lands depending upon what is appropriate to the circumstances
very well then one
we would like you to bestow a little of your teachings on us so that when we return to our own land we will have something to remember the thus come one by
the announced to the there is the doctrine of the exhaustible and the inexhaustible emancipation
you would do well to learn this
what does exhaustible mean it means those things that are conditioned
what does inexhaustible mean it means those things that are unconditioned
but beings such as the do not exhaust or have done with the conditioned nor do they dwell in the unconditioned
what is meant by not exhausting the conditioned it means not setting aside great compassion not renouncing great pity giving profound expression to the mind of comprehensive wisdom and never forgetting it teaching and converting living beings without ever wearying being constantly mindful of the four methods of winning people and applying them in season guarding and upholding the correct law without thought for life or limb
it means to work tirelessly to plant the roots of goodness to keep the will at all times fixed on expedient means and the transfer of merit to others to seek the law without ever slacking to preach the law without ever
it means diligently making offerings to the purposely entering the realm of birth and death with no feelings of fear facing all types of honor or disgrace without thought of sadness or joy not looking with contempt on those who have yet to learn and respecting the learned as though they were the himself
it means arousing correct thoughts in those sunk in earthly desires but without unduly the desire to remove oneself from passion
one should not cling to ones own desires but applaud the desires of others
it means looking on states as though they were a form of hell but on the realm of birth and death as though contemplating a garden viewing those who come seeking instruction with thoughts of how one may be a good teacher setting aside ones own possessions and thinking how to acquire comprehensive wisdom seeing those who violate the precepts and rousing thoughts of how to save them
it means thinking of the as ones father and mother thinking of the elements of the way as ones retinue of followers working ceaselessly to the roots of goodness using the of other pure lands to complete a land of ones own practicing unbounded charity and thereby acquiring auspicious physical characteristics putting aside all evil and purifying body mouth and mind dwelling in the realm of birth and death for countless ever valiant in mind listening to the immeasurable virtues of the ones determination never using the sword of wisdom to cut down the thieves of earthly desires going beyond the realm of components elements and the burden of living beings and bringing them to unending emancipation employing great in driving back and the armies of the devil constantly seeking to practice the wisdom that is without thought the true aspect of reality with regard to worldly things lessening desires knowing what is enough with regard to things tirelessly seeking them and yet not rejecting the things of the world
it means never breaking the rules of proper demeanor yet being able to to worldly ways calling up transcendental powers and wisdom and using them to guide living beings acquiring concentration and retention of memory so that one never what one has heard being able to distinguish the different capacities of people correctly and freeing them from doubt expounding the law with a pleasing and appropriate eloquence that flows scrupulously carrying out the ten good actions and receiving the blessings of human and heavenly beings cultivating the four immeasurable qualities of mind and opening up the way earnestly requesting to hear the preaching of the law and receiving it with joy and commendation acquiring the voice of the and the excellence of his body mouth and mind acquiring his proper demeanor practicing his good law with profound diligence ever more accomplished in action using the great vehicle teachings to create a community of never in mind never missing an opportunity for acts of who practices these methods may be called a who does not exhaust the conditioned
what is meant by saying that the does not dwell in the unconditioned it means that one studies and practices the teachings on emptiness but does not take emptiness to be enlightenment
one studies and practices the teachings on and but does not take and to be enlightenment
one studies and practices the teachings on of causes but does not take to be enlightenment
one views things as but does not neglect to cultivate the roots of goodness
one views the world as marked by suffering but does not hate to be born and die in it
one sees that there is no permanent ego but is tireless in instructing others
one sees that there is such a thing as tranquil extinction but does not dwell in extinction for long
one views the world as something to be cast off withdrawn from yet with body and mind one practices goodness
one sees there is no destination yet one makes the good law ones destination
one sees there is no birth yet one takes on the form of birth in order to share the burdens of others
one sees that of passion should be cut off yet one does not cut them off
one sees that there is nothing to be practiced yet one practices the law in order to teach and convert living beings
one embraces the view of emptiness and nothingness yet does not discard ones great pity
one embraces the view that the correct law nirvana can be attained yet one does not follow lesser vehicle doctrines in this matter
one embraces the view that all phenomena are void and false lacking firmness lacking personality lacking a master lacking form yet while ones original vow remains unfulfilled one does not regard merits virtues meditation or wisdom as meaningless
when one practices these methods one may be called a who does not dwell in the unconditioned
at that time those having heard the explanation of this teaching were all filled with great delight
selecting from among the many wonderful flowers those of various colors and various fragrances they scattered them throughout the whole world
and then having made their offering to the and to these teachings as well as to the other they bowed their heads in at the feet and sighed at having heard what they had never heard before exclaiming knows how to employ expedient means in a truly skillful manner having spoken these words they suddenly vanished from sight and returned to their own country
seeing at that time the one said to you wanted to see the thus come one
now how do you regard the thus come one said as i would regard my own true form or that same way do i regard the thus come one
i regard the thus come one as not existing from past times not departing in the future not abiding here at present
i do not regard him as form i do not regard him as resembling form i do not regard him as having the nature of form
i do not regard him as perception conception volition or consciousness
i do not regard him as resembling consciousness
i do not regard him as having the nature of consciousnessl he does not rise out of the four great elements but is the same as the empty sky
he is without accumulation of the six he has transcended eye ear nose tongue body and mind and does not exist in the threefold world
he has separated himself from the three of greed anger and stupidity passed through the three gates to emancipation and acquired the three understandings which are the equivalent of ignorance
he is not identical in form with others not different in form not of his own form not of some other form not lacking form not acquiring form
he is not on this shore not on the other shore not in midstream and yet he converts living beings
spells out the full process of negation only for the first and last of the five components form and consciousness but it is assumed that the same apply to the other three perception conception and volition
he is seen to be in tranquil extinction but does not remain in extinction for long
he is not this he is not that he does not show himself in this he does not show himself in that
one can not know him through wisdom one can not be conscious of him through consciousness
he is without darkness without brightness without name without form without strength without weakness
he is not pure not not in any direction not removed from direction not conditioned not unconditioned without purport without explanation
he is not charitable not stingy does not observe the precepts does not violate them is not not irate does not press forward does not slack is not calm in mind is not distracted is not wise is not stupid is not sincere is not deceitful does arrive does not depart does not go out does not enter in
he is cut off from all that can be said in words
he is not a field that produces merit not a field that does not produce merit he is not worthy of he is not unworthy of
he is not to be acquired not to be put aside does not possess form is not without form
he is identical with the ultimate reality one with the
he can not be labeled can not be measured for he is beyond all labeling and measuring
he is not big not little not to be seen not to be heard not to be awakened to not to be known
he is removed from all ties and bonds equal to all identical with living beings free of distinctions with regard to things
he is utterly without loss without contamination without anxiety without action without rousing without birth without extinction without fear without sorrow without joy without weariness without attachment without a past existence without a future existence without a present existence
no words or explanations whatsoever can distinguish and depict him
one the body of the thus come one is like this and this is the way i regard him
to regard in this manner is called correct regarding
to regard in any other is called erroneous regarding
at that time asked where did you die before you were reborn here said in the law that you learned is there any such thing as dying or being born replied no there is no dying or being born
if all things are without the nature of dying or being born then why do you ask where i died before i was reborn here what is your opinion do phantom men and women conjured up by a magician know anything of dying or being born no there is no dying or being born for them
and have you not heard the say that all things are in the nature of conjured beings yes replied
if all things are in the nature of conjured beings then why do you ask where i died before i was reborn here is in its nature simply the destruction of something that is empty and and being born is in its nature the continuation of something that is empty and
but the though he dies does not wipe out his good roots and though he is born he does not prolong those things that are evil
at that time the said to there is a country called wonderful joy with a named immovable
here died in that country and was reborn in this one
said i have never heard of such a thing one that this man could bring himself to abandon a land of purity and willingly come to this place with all its wrath and injury said to what is your opinion when the light of the sun shines forth does it mix with the darkness no replied
when the light of the sun shines forth all darkness at once ceases to exist
said and the does it visit this continent of because it wishes to use its brightness to drive the darkness away replied
said the is like this
though he is born in an land he does this so he can convert living beings
he does not mix with or share its stupidity and darkness
he merely out the darkness of earthly desires that besets living beings
at that time the members of the great assembly were filled with longing desiring to see the wonderful joy world and the thus come one immovable and his host of and
the knew what all the members of the assembly were thinking and he said to good man you must make the land wonderful joy and the thus come one immovable and his host of and visible to the members of this assembly
they all long to see them then thought to himself now without rising from my seat i shall take this country wonderful joy with its iron mountains and rivers its valleys waterways great seas fountains its and the other mountains along with its sun moon stars the palaces of the heavenly beings dragons spirits and as well as its host of and its cities villages men and women old and young along with the thus come one immovable and the trees and wonderful lotus blossoms that are able to carry out the work in the ten directions the jeweled that extend from the continent of all the way up to the heaven the jeweled stairways by which the heavenly beings may descend and all pay reverence to the thus come one immovable and listen to and receive his teachings and the inhabitants of may also ascend these stairways to the heaven and visit its heavenly beings for the world wonderful joy is replete with immeasurable merits such as these extending upward to the heaven and downward to its watery all this i shall lift from its place and take in my right hand as though removing it from a potters wheel and bring it here to this world like some flower garland i am holding and show it to all these beings having had this thought he entered and manifesting his transcendental powers lifted the wonderful joy world out of its place with his right hand and set it down on the ground in this world
the host of and and the various heavenly and human beings in that world who had acquired transcendental knowledge all cried out together saying look one someone is making off with us save and protect us we beg of you but the immovable said this is not my doing
this is the work of supernatural powers
and the rest of the beings in that world who had not yet acquired transcendental knowledge did not even realize or know where they had gotten to
but although the wonderful joy world had been placed on the ground in this world it had not increased or decreased in size and this world likewise had in no way become or narrow but was no different from what it had always been
then addressed his great assembly saying do you see the wonderful joy world the thus come one immovable and the splendid of his land the purity of the practices carried out by his the impeccable of his major disciples all replied yes we have seen them
the said if wish to acquire a land as pure and spotless as this they should study the way practiced by the thus come one immovable
when this wonderful joy country appeared in the world fourteen of persons set their minds on attaining all desiring to be born in the land wonderful joy
thereupon gave them a prophecy saying you will be born in that land
then the wonderful joy world having finished enrichment and benefit upon this country returned to its original place
all the members of the assembly saw it do so
the addressed saying did you see this wonderful joy world and the immovable yes i saw them one
and i beg you to enable all living beings to acquire a clean and pure land like that of the immovable and to gain transcendental powers like those of
one i and the others have happily acquired excellent benefits being able to see this person and to approach and make offerings to him
and other living beings either now while the is here or after he has passed away if they hear this will acquire excellent benefits as well
and how much more so if having heard it they believe and understand it accept and uphold it read and recite it it to others and practice it as the law directs
one who holds this in hand has thereby acquired the storehouse of the jewels of the law
if one reads and it understands and it and practices it as the law directs the will guard and keep in mind that person
and if there are those who give to such a person let it be known that this is giving to the
if there are those who copy and preserve these let it be known that the thus come one will visit their rooms
and if there are those who hearing this can respond with appropriate joy those persons will acquire comprehensive wisdom
if there are those who believe and understand this even just one four line verse of it and can it to others let it be known that such persons will receive a prophecy of the attainment of
the offering of the law at that time spoke up from the great assembly addressing the in these words one though i have heard hundreds and thousands of from the and i have never heard one with such astounding freedom of action transcendental powers and unfailing grasp of the true reality
according to my understanding of what the has just said if there are living beings who hear this on the law believe and understand it accept and uphold it read and recite it then they will surely and without doubt acquire that law and how much more so if they practice it as the law directs
such persons will shut off all evil paths of existence and open the gates to all good ones
they will be constantly guarded and kept in mind by the will refute the teachings overcome the devil and his animosity cultivate and practice and rest secure in the place of practice following in the way by the thus come one
one if there are persons who accept and uphold read and recite this and practice it as the law directs then i and my followers will offer to them and serve them
and if there is a place among the villages or towns the mountain forests or the broad plain where this exists then i and my followers will go there together to listen to and accept the law and those who do not yet believe in it i will lead to belief and to those who already believe i will be a guardian
the said excellent excellent heavenly lord it is just as you have said
and i will assist you in your joyful task
this in comprehensive manner the of the of the past future and present which is beyond comprehension
therefore heavenly lord if good men and good women accept uphold read recite and make offerings to this they are making offering to the of past future and present
heavenly lord suppose this world were as full of thus come ones as it is of rice and plants or forest trees
if there were good men or good women who for the space of a or less than a were to and honor praise and make offerings to them and provide for their wellbeing and if after those had passed away these persons built towers adorned with the seven treasures to house the from each body towers so broad they covered the four continents and so high they reached to the heaven their central pole richly decorated and if these persons made offerings of all kinds of flowers incense necklaces flags pennants and music all of the most refined and wonderful kind and did this for the space of a or less than a lord what is your opinion would these persons have thereby planted the seeds of many blessings replied of many blessings indeed one if i were to spend a hundred thousand million i could never finish describing all their blessings and merits
the said to the heavenly lord you should understand that if there are good men and good women who on hearing this on the emancipation beyond comprehension believe understand accept uphold read recite and practice it their blessings will be even greater than those of such persons
why because the of the is all born from this
the marks of are beyond limit or measure and for that reason their blessings are immeasurable
the then said to the heavenly lord a countless number of in the past there appeared in the world a named medicine king thus come one worthy of offerings of right and universal knowledge perfect clarity and conduct well gone understanding the world worthy of people teacher of heavenly and human beings onel his world was called great and his was called
this had a life span of twenty small
his monks numbered million and his monks twelve million
heavenly lord at that time there was a sage king named jeweled parasol who possessed all the seven treasures and ruled over the four continents of the world
this king had a thousand sons upright valiant capable of overpowering their enemies
at that time jeweled parasol came with his followers to make offerings to the thus come one medicine king providing him with all he needed for his wellbeing
he did this for five whole and when the five were over he said to his sons you too should make offerings to the with the same deeply searching mind as i have shown
the thousand sons obeying their fathers command proceeded to make offerings to the thus come one medicine king for another five full providing him with everything needed for his wellbeing
one of the kings sons named moon parasol sat all alone thinking to himself there some offering that is better than these then through the supernatural power a heavenly being appeared in the sky and said good man the offering of the law is the finest of all offerings the son asked what is the offering of the law the heavenly being replied you should go and ask the thus come one medicine king
he will explain to you in detail the offering of the law the phrases following the name of the constitute the conventional ten epithets or honorable titles for a
at once the prince moon parasol went to call on the thus come one medicine king
after bowing his head in at the feet he retired to one side and addressed the saying one among all offerings the offering of the law is the finest
but what is the offering of the law the said good man the offering of the law means the profound preached by the
the people of this world all find them hard to believe and hard to accept for they are wonderfully subtle and hard to make out clean and pure and without stain
they can not be grasped through the making of distinctions or through thought
they are contained in the storehouse of the and are sealed with the seal and where this seal is affixed one reaches the level of no regression
they bring about observance of the six the skillful discrimination of meanings and compliance with the teachings of and through the finest of all one enters the realm of great pity and compassion
the put an end to all devilish affairs and all erroneous views conform to the teaching on and those on no ego no individual no living beings no life span emptiness no form no action and no arousing
they enable living beings to sit in the place of practice and to turn the wheel of the law heavenly beings dragons spirits and the others join in praising them
they can enable living beings to enter the storehouse of the law they embrace the comprehensive wisdom of the and sages and the way practiced by the
relying on the principle of the true nature of all phenomena they clearly set forth the doctrines of suffering emptiness no ego and tranquil extinction
they can save all living beings who violate the and in all believers and those given to greed and attachment they can fear
and sages join in them
they turn away from the sufferings of birth and death and show instead the joy of nirvana
they are preached by the of the ten directions and the three of past present and future
the seal of memory that insures full retention of the teachings
if one hears such as these believes understands accepts reads and them and by employing the power of expedient means makes distinctions and them for the sake of living beings rendering their meaning perfectly clear one is thereby guarding and protecting the law and this is called the offering of the law
again the enable one to practice the teachings as the law directs to accord with the chain of to set aside erroneous views and accept the truth of to realize once and for all that there is no ego no existence of living beings no deviating from or with the law of cause and effect thus removing all thought of personal possession
they teach one to rely on meaning not on words to rely on wisdom not on consciousness to rely on that are complete in meaning not on those that are incomplete in meaning to rely on the law not on the person to go along with the true form of things realizing that there is no entering in and no destination
they teach that since ignorance in the end does not exist so too action in the end does not exist and so on through the other links in the chain of down to the fact that since birth in the end does not exist so too old age and death in the end do not exist
and when one learns to see in this manner the chain of will cease to have any form that comes to an end and one will no longer entertain the view that it does
this is called the finest of all offerings of the law the then said to the heavenly lord when prince moon parasol heard medicine king the law in this manner he acquired a tolerance of the truth of
at once he took off his jeweled robes and the ornaments that adorned his body and offered them to the saying one after the thus come one has passed into extinction i will carry out offerings of the law and guard the correct law
i beg you through your might and supernatural powers to take pity on me and strengthen me so that i can conquer the devil and his enmity and practice the way the knew the thoughts that were in his deeply searching mind and bestowed on him a prophecy saying in that latter age you will guard and protect the of the law
heavenly lord at that time prince moon parasol observing the purity of the law and hearing this prophecy bestowed by the was moved by faith to leave the household life and take up the practice of the good law
he had not devoted himself to diligent practice for long when he was able to acquire the five transcendental powers carry out the way and gain power and unflagging eloquence
after the had passed into extinction he exercised the transcendental powers he had acquired the power to retain all he had heard and the eloquence for fully ten small continuing to turn the wheel of the law turned by the thus come one medicine king and spreading the teachings abroad
this monk moon parasol by guarding and protecting the law and putting forth diligent effort was able in the space of his lifetime to convert hundreds thousands millions of persons insuring that they would never in their pursuit of to cause fourteen of others to develop a profound aspiration for the way of the or the and to enable countless living beings to be born in the heavenly realm
heavenly lord the person who was king jeweled parasol at the time i have been speaking do you think he has now become a named jewel flame thus come one
and the kings one thousand sons will become the thousand who will appear in our present age the worthy
was the first to attain and the last will be the thus come one named
the monk moon parasol is none other than myself
thus heavenly lord you should understand this important point
the offering of the law is the finest of all offerings
it is first in rank and without equal
therefore heavenly lord you should use this offering of the law as your offering to the
various predict that a thousand will appear in our present or which is accordingly termed the worthy
is the fourth to appear and will be the fifth
then the addressed the saying i now take this law of gathered over countless millions of and entrust it to you
in the latter age after the has passed into extinction you must employ your supernatural powers to propagate such as this spreading them throughout the continent of and never allowing them to be wiped out
why because in the ages to come there will be good men and good women as well as heavenly beings dragons spirits and others who will set their minds on attaining and will delight in the great law if they are unable to hear such as this they will lose the opportunity to gain excellent benefits
but if beings such as these hear these they will surely believe and delight greatly in them and set their minds on a rare achievement
therefore you must respectfully accept these and considering how living beings can best gain benefits from them them far and wide
you should understand that there are two types of
what are these two types the first type loves varied phrases and literary
the second is not afraid of deeper principles and is able to enter into the true meaning
if there are those who love varied phrases and literary you my be sure that they are beginners in the way
but if there are those who approaching these extremely profound with their teachings on and are not timid or fearful but can enter into the meaning and having heard the with pure minds will accept uphold read and recite them and practice them as the law directs you may be sure that they have been practicing the way for a long time
again there are two attitudes among those called beginners that prevent them from getting a firm grasp on these extremely profound teachings
what are these two first is that of persons who when they hear some profound they have not heard before are alarmed and and giving way to doubt can not bring themselves to comply with it
in their disbelief they speak of it saying i have never heard this before where does it come from second is that of persons who though there are those who guard uphold understand and profound of this type are unwilling to associate closely with them to offer them or treat them with respect but at times may even speak of their faults before others
where you find these two attitudes you may be sure the persons are beginners in the way
they do injury to themselves and can not train their minds to accept the profound teachings
again there are two attitudes among the who though they believe and understand the profound teachings yet do injury to themselves and are unable to accept the truth of
what are these two first is that of persons who are contemptuous of beginner and will not teach or enlighten them
second is that of persons who though they understand the profound teachings seize upon surface appearances and make distinctions
these are the two attitudes
the after listening to these words of exposition addressed the saying one this is something i have never heard before
it is as the has said
i must remove myself far off from evils such as these and strive to uphold this law of that the thus come one has gathered over
if in the ages to come there are good men and good women who seek the great vehicle i will see to it that such as this come into their hands will lend them powers of memorization and will cause them to accept uphold read and recite the and them far and wide for others
one if in that latter age there are those who can accept uphold read and recite them and them for others you should know that all of them do so because i have inspired and strengthened them with my supernatural powers
the said excellent excellent it is as you have said
and the will assist you in your joyful task with this all the pressing their palms together said to the after the thus come one has passed into extinction we too will spread the law of far and wide throughout the lands in the ten directions and will guide and assist those who the law seeing to it that they acquire this
then the four heavenly kings said to the one in the towns and villages the mountain forests and the broad plain wherever there are those who possess this read and recite it understand and it we will take our ranks of officials and and go to where they are so that we may hear the law and will shelter and protect them making certain that no one approaches within a hundred of them on any side to try to take unfair advantage of them then the said to you must accept and uphold this and propagate it far and wide
replied indeed i will i have already accepted and upheld its essentials one
but by what name should this be called the said this should be called the expositions of
and another name for it is the doctrine of the emancipation beyond comprehension
this is how you should accept and uphold it
when the had finished expounding this the rich man and the others along with the heavenly and human beings and all the other members of the great assembly were filled with joy at hearing the preaching of the and they believed and accepted it and respectfully put it into practice
thus have i heard
at one time the was staying on the vulture peak in with a large company of twelve thousand monks
they were all great sages who had already attained supernatural powers
among them were the following the venerable the venerable the venerable the venerable the venerable the venerable the venerable the venerable the venerable the venerable the venerable the venerable the venerable the venerable the venerable the venerable the venerable the venerable the venerable the venerable the venerable the venerable the venerable the venerable the venerable the venerable the venerable the venerable the venerable the venerable and the venerable

virtues of the audience each of these following the virtues of the is endowed with the immeasurable practices and vows of the path and firmly dwells in all the meritorious deeds
he freely travels in all the ten quarters and employs skillful means of emancipation
he enters the treasury of the of the and reaches the other shore
throughout the innumerable worlds he attains enlightenment
first dwelling in the heaven he proclaims the true
having left the heavenly palace he descends into his mothers womb
soon after he is born from her right side he takes seven steps

he shows his ability in calculation writing archery and horsemanship
he is also conversant with the divine arts and in many volumes
in the field outside the palace he trains himself in the arts and at court shows that he also enjoys the pleasures of the senses
when he first encounters old age sickness and death he realizes the of the world
he his kingdom wealth and throne and goes into the mountains to practice the way
after sending back the white horse that he has been riding together with the jewelled crown and ornaments which he has been wearing he takes off his magnificent clothes and puts on a robe
he cuts his hair and his beard sits upright under a tree and strives at ascetic practices for six years in accord with the traditional way
since he has appeared in the world of the five he behaves as the multitude
and as his body appears dirty he takes a bath in the golden river
as a god bends a branch down towards him he is able to climb up the river bank
a divine bird follows him closely to the seat of enlightenment
a takes the form of a youth and perceiving a favorable sign respectfully presents him with the auspicious grass
the compassionately accepts it spreads it under the and sits upon it with his legs crossed
he a great flood of light to inform of this
and his army come to attack and tempt him but he brings them under control with the power of wisdom and makes them all surrender
then he attains the supreme and realizes the highest perfect enlightenment

he beats the blows the the the rolls the the brings the and the
at all times he awakens the world with the sound of the
his light countless causing the entire world to quake in six ways
it encompasses realm shaking his palace so that he and his host become frightened and surrender
the tears asunder the net of evil wrong views removes afflictions the gutters of desire protects the opens the washes off the of the passions and reveals the pure white
he unifies everything in the and thus proclaims the right teaching
he enters the town to beg he accepts even rich food to enable the donors to accumulate merit and also to show that he is a field of virtue
wishing to the he smiles and so cures the three pains with various
he teaches that the aspiration for enlightenment has immeasurable merit and by giving predictions to he enables them to attain
he demonstrates that he passes into nirvana but endlessly brings sentient beings to emancipation
in removing their planting various roots of virtue and attaining excellent merit he displays wonderful and inconceivable works
furthermore each of the in the assembly is able to visit various and teachings of the way
his manner of practice is pure and
just as a magician with his perfect skill can create at will various illusions including images of man or woman at will so the having thoroughly learned all the methods of emancipation and attained serene awareness of reality can freely teach and transform beings
he himself everywhere in innumerable performing acts of compassion for sentient beings tirelessly and with diligence
he has thus obtained complete mastery of such methods of emancipation
he is thoroughly conversant with the essentials of the for and as his fame spreads everywhere he guides sentient beings throughout the ten quarters
all remember him and give him their protection
he has already dwelt in all the and performed all the deeds of the great sage
he proclaims the teachings acts as a great master for other and with profound and wisdom guides multitudes of beings
with penetrating insight into the essential nature of he different aspects of living beings and closely watches over all the worlds
in making offerings to the he transformed bodies like flashes of lightning
having well learned the extensive wisdom of fearless and having realized the illusory nature of he nets and all the bonds of passion
he rises above the stages of and and attains the of emptiness and
he skillfully provides expedient means and thus reveals three distinct teachings
then for those of the middle and lower stages he demonstrates his passing into nirvana
but in reality he is and and being aware that in themselves neither arise nor perish he realizes that they are of absolute equality
he has attained innumerable a hundred thousand and various kinds of spiritual faculties and wisdom
with the meditation of vast and universal tranquillity he enters deeply into the for
after attaining the he proclaims and all the
while dwelling deep in meditation he visualizes all the innumerable and in an instant visits every one of them
by and teaching the ultimate truth to sentient beings he delivers them from the state of extreme pains from the conditions in which suffering is so great as to prevent people from finding time for practices and also from the conditions in which suffering is not so great as to prevent them from doing so

having awakened great compassion for sentient beings he kindly the teaching and endows them with the
he blocks the paths to the three evil realms opens the gate of virtue and without waiting for their request provides beings with the
he does this for the multitude of beings just as a son loves and respects his parents

with such roots of virtue all the in the assembly had reached the shore of emancipation
they had acquired the immeasurable merit and attained the sacred pure and inconceivable wisdom
innumerable such as these assembled there all at once
glorious features of the at that time all the senses of the one radiated joy his entire body appeared serene and glorious and his august countenance looked most majestic
having perceived the holy intention the venerable rose from his seat his right shoulder himself and joining his palms in reverence said to the one today all your senses are radiant with joy your body is serene and glorious and your august countenance is as majestic as a clear mirror whose brightness radiates outward and inward

how can this present not contemplate all other for what reason does his countenance look so majestic and brilliant then the one said to tell me whether some god urged you to put this question to the or whether you asked about his glorious countenance from your own wise observation
replied to the no god came to prompt me
i asked you about this matter of my own accord
the said well said
i am very pleased with your question
you have shown profound wisdom and subtle insight in asking me this wise question out of compassion for sentient beings
as the i regard beings of the three worlds with boundless great compassion
the reason for my appearance in the world is to reveal teachings of the way and save multitudes of beings by them with true benefits
even in countless millions of it is difficult to come upon and meet a
it is as difficult as seeing an flower which blooms very rarely
your question is of great benefit and will enlighten all heavenly and human beings

practices of the path the said to as soon as the spoke those verses the entire earth shook in six ways and a rain of wonderful flowers fell from heaven scattering everywhere
spontaneous music was heard and a voice in the sky said surely you will attain the highest perfect enlightenment
then the kept all those great vows which were sincere unfailing and unsurpassed in the whole world and intensely aspired to attain nirvana
then after proclaiming and establishing those universal vows in the presence of the before the multitude of beings including the eight kinds of superhuman beings such as and and also and the was solely intent on producing a glorious and exquisite land
the which he sought to establish was vast in extent unsurpassed and supremely wonderful always present and subject neither to decay nor change
during inconceivable and innumerable he cultivated the immeasurable meritorious practices of the path
he did not harbor any thought of greed hatred or cruelty nor did he allow any ideas of greed hatred or cruelty to arise
he was unattached to any form sound smell taste touch or idea
possessed of the power to persevere he did not avoid undergoing various afflictions
having little desire for his own sake he knew contentment
without any thought enmity or stupidity he dwelt continually in tranquil
his wisdom was and his mind free of falsehood and
with an expression of tenderness in his face and with kindness in his speech he spoke to others in consonance with their inner thoughts
courageous and diligent and he devoted himself solely to the pursuit of the pure thereby a multitude of beings
he revered the three treasures respected his teachers and elders and thus adorned his practices with a great store of merits
by so doing he enabled sentient beings to partake of it
he dwelt in the realization that all are empty devoid of distinctive features and not to be sought after and that they neither act nor arise he thus realized that all are like magical creations
he avoided all wrong speech that would bring harm upon himself or others or both he engaged in right speech that would bring benefit to himself or others or both
he abandoned his kingdom and the throne leaving behind wealth and sensuous pleasures
practicing the six himself he taught others to do the same
during innumerable he accumulated merits and virtues
wherever he was born an immeasurable stock of treasure spontaneously appeared as he wished
he taught countless sentient beings and guided them on the path of the highest true enlightenment
he was reborn as a rich man a lay a member of the highest caste or of a noble family a king a monarch a king of one of the six heavens in the world of desire or even higher as a
he revered and worshipped all by making the four kinds of offering to them
the merit he thus acquired was great
fragrance issued from his mouth as from a blue and every pore of his body emitted the scent of sandalwood which permeated innumerable worlds
his appearance was majestic and his physical characteristics and marks were truly wonderful
from his hands inexhaustible treasures clothes food and drink rare and exquisite flowers and incense silken banners and other ornaments were produced
in such manifestations he was among all heavenly and human beings
he thus attained the command of all
attainment of asked the has the already attained and then passed into nirvana or has he not yet attained or is he dwelling somewhere at present the replied to the has already attained and is now dwelling in a western called peace and bliss a hundred thousand of lands away from here
further asked the how much time has passed since he attained the replied since he attained about ten have passed
he continued in that the earth is composed of seven jewels namely gold silver coral amber and which have spontaneously appeared
the land itself is so vast spreading to the farthest extent that it is impossible to know its limit
all the rays of light from those jewels and create manifold reflections producing a dazzling illumination
those pure superb and exquisite are unsurpassed in all the worlds of the ten quarters
they are the finest of all gems and are like those of the sixth heaven
in that land there are no mountains such as mount and the mountains
likewise there are neither oceans nor seas valleys nor gorges
but one can see those manifestations by the power if one so wishes
in that land there is no hell neither are there realms of hungry spirits and animals nor other adverse conditions
neither do the four seasons of spring summer autumn and winter exist
it is always moderate and pleasant never cold or hot
then asked the if one there is no mount in that land what sustains the heaven of the four kings and the heaven of the gods the said to what sustains which is the third heaven of the world of desire and other heavens up to the highest heaven of the world of form answered the consequences of are inconceivable
the said to inconceivable indeed are the consequences of and so are the worlds of the
by the power of meritorious deeds sentient beings in that land dwell on the ground of reward
that is why those heavens exist without mount
continued i do not doubt this myself but have asked you about it simply because i wished to remove such doubts for the benefit of sentient beings in the future
light the said to the majestic light of the is the most exalted
no other light can match his
the light of some a hundred and that of others a thousand
briefly that of the eastern as numerous as the sands of the river
in the same way it the in the south west and north in each of the four intermediate quarters above and below
further the light of some extends seven feet that of others one or two three four or five and the distance covered increases in this way until the light of some one
for this reason is called by the following names the of infinite light the of boundless light the of light the of incomparable light the of the light of the king of flame the of pure light the of the light of joy the of light of wisdom the of unceasing light the of inconceivable light the of ineffable light and the of the light the sun and the moon
if sentient beings encounter his light their three are removed they feel tenderness joy and pleasure and good thoughts arise
if sentient beings in the three realms of suffering see his light they will all be relieved and freed from affliction
at the end of their lives they all reach emancipation
the light of shines brilliantly illuminating all the of the ten quarters
there is no place where it is not perceived
i am not the only one who now praises his light
all the and praise and glorify it in the same way
if sentient beings having heard of the majestic virtue of his light glorify it continually day and night with sincerity of heart they will be able to attain birth in his land as they wish
then the multitudes of and will praise their excellent virtue
later when they attain all the and in the ten quarters will praise their light just as i now praise the light of
the continued the majestic glory of the light of could not be exhaustively described even if i praised it continuously day and night for the period of one
the said to the life of is so long that it is impossible for anyone to calculate it
to give an illustration let us suppose that all the innumerable sentient beings in the worlds of the ten quarters were reborn in human form and that every one became a or
even if they assembled in one place concentrated their thoughts and exercised the power of their wisdom to the utmost to reckon the length of the life even after a thousand million they could still not reach its limit
so it is with the of heavenly beings and human beings in his land
similarly it is not to be encompassed by any means of reckoning or by any metaphorical expression
again the number of the and living there is incalculable
they are fully endowed with transcendent wisdom and free in their exercise of majestic power they could hold the entire world in their hands
the number of the audience at the first assembly the said to the number of at the first teaching assembly of that was incalculable so was the number of the
even if an immeasurable and number of humans multiplied by millions of should all become like and together reckon their number during innumerable of or even until they attain nirvana they could still not know that number
let us suppose that there is a great ocean infinitely deep and wide and that one takes a drop of water out of it with a hundredth part of a split hair
how would you compare that drop of water with the rest of the ocean replied when the drop of water is compared with the great ocean it is impossible even for one skilled in astronomy or mathematics to know the proportion or for anyone to describe it by any or metaphorical expressions
the said to even if people like were to count for millions of of the number of the and at the first teaching assembly who could be counted would be like a drop of water and the number of sages yet to be counted would be like the rest of the ocean
jewelled trees again trees completely fill that land
there are some made of gold some of silver and others made of crystal coral or
there are also trees made of two to seven kinds of jewels
there are gold trees with leaves flowers and fruits of silver silver trees with leaves flowers and fruits of gold trees with leaves flowers and fruits of crystal crystal trees with leaves flowers and fruits of coral trees with leaves flowers and fruits of trees with leaves flowers and fruits of trees with leaves flowers and fruits made of various jewels
again there are jewelled trees with roots trunks branches crystal coral leaves flowers and fruits
there are jewelled trees with roots trunks crystal branches coral leaves flowers and fruits
there are jewelled trees with roots crystal trunks coral branches leaves flowers and fruits
there are jewelled trees with crystal roots coral trunks branches leaves flowers and fruits
there are jewelled trees with coral roots trunks branches leaves flowers and crystal fruits
there are jewelled trees with roots trunks branches leaves crystal flowers and coral fruits
there are jewelled trees with roots trunks branches crystal leaves coral flowers and fruits
these jewelled trees are in parallel rows their trunks are evenly spaced their branches are in level layers their leaves are symmetrical their flowers and their fruits are well arranged
the brilliant colors of these trees are so that it is impossible to see them all
when a pure breeze through them exquisite sounds of the scales such as and spontaneously arise and make symphonic music
the again the of the is four million in height and five thousand in circumference at its base
its branches spread two hundred thousand in each of the four directions
it is a natural cluster of all kinds of precious stones and is adorned with the kings of jewels namely moonlight gems and gems
everywhere between its hang jewelled ornaments with a thousand million different colors in various ways and their innumerable beams shine with the utmost brilliance
the itself is covered with nets of rare excellent gems and on it appear all kinds of ornaments in accordance with ones wishes
when a gentle breeze through its branches and leaves innumerable exquisite arise which spread far and wide pervading all the other in the ten quarters
those who hear the sounds attain penetrating insight into and dwell in the stage of
until they attain their senses of hearing will remain clear and sharp and they will not suffer from any pain or sickness
whether they hear the sounds of the see its colors smell its perfumes taste its flavors perceive its lights or conceive of the in their minds they all attain profoundly penetrating insight into and dwell in the stage of
until they attain their six will remain sharp and clear and they will not suffer from any pain or disease
when humans and of that land see the they will attain three insights first insight into reality through hearing the sacred sounds second insight into reality by being in accord with it and third the insight into the of all
these benefits are all bestowed by the majestic power of the power of his primal vow his perfectly fulfilled vow his clear and manifest vow his firm vow and his accomplished vow
the said to a king of this world possesses a hundred thousand kinds of music
from the realm ruled by a monarch up to the sixth heaven the sounds of the music produced in each higher realm are ten million of times superior to those of a lower one
the thousands of varieties of musical sound produced in the sixth heaven are a thousand of times inferior to one sound produced from the trees in the land of
again in that land there are thousands of varieties of natural music which are all without exception sounds of the
they are clear and serene full of depth and resonance delicate and harmonious they are the most excellent of sounds in all the worlds of the ten quarters
glorious again the halls monasteries palaces and pavilions are spontaneous all adorned with the seven jewels and hung with curtains of various other jewels such as pearls and gems
inside and out to right and left are bathing pools
some of them are ten in length breadth and depth some are twenty others thirty and so on until we come to those measuring a hundred thousand in length breadth and depth
they are brimful of the water of eight excellent qualities clear fragrant and tasting like nectar
there are golden pools with beds of silver sand silver pools with beds of golden sand crystal pools with beds of sand pools with beds of crystal sand coral pools with beds of amber sand amber pools with beds of coral sand pools with beds of sand pools with beds of sand pools with beds of sand pools with beds of sand
others are composed of two to seven jewels
on the banks of these pools are sandalwood trees whose flowers and leaves hang down and diffuse perfumes everywhere
heavenly of blue pink yellow and white bloom profusely in various tints and tones completely covering the surface of the water
if and in that land enter the and wish the water to rise to their ankles it rises to their ankles
if they wish it to rise to their knees it rises to their knees
if they wish it to rise to their it rises to their
if they wish it to rise to their necks it rises to their necks
if they wish it to pour over their bodies it spontaneously pours over their bodies
if they wish it to recede it
its temperature is moderate cool or warm according to their wishes
the water comforts the body and the mind washing away their mental
clear and pure the water is so transparent that it seems
the shines so brightly that even the depth of the water can not prevent its brilliance from being seen
the rippling water forms meandering streams which join and flow into each other
their movement is peaceful and quiet neither too fast nor too slow and their ripples spontaneously produce innumerable wonderful sounds
one can hear whatever sound one wishes
for example some hear the sound some hear the sound some others hear tranquillity emptiness and great compassion ten powers special qualities supernatural powers neither arising nor perishing insight into the of all and so on until the various sounds of the wonderful such as the sprinkling of nectar upon the head of a are heard
as one hears those sounds one attains immeasurable joy and accords with the principles of purity absence of desires extinction and reality
one is in harmony with the three treasures the powers and special qualities and also with supernatural powers and other methods of practice for and
not even the names of the three realms of suffering are heard there but only sounds of bliss
for this reason that land is called peace and bliss
bodily appearance of the inhabitants and the pleasures they enjoy those born in that are endowed with such bodies of purity and provided with various exquisite sounds supernatural powers and virtues
the palaces in which they dwell their clothing food and drink the wonderful flowers and the various kinds of incense and are like those naturally provided in the sixth heaven of the world of desire
at plates made of the seven jewels namely gold silver coral and amber and also pearl spontaneously appear filled with food and drink of a hundred tastes according to ones wishes
although the food is offered no one actually eats it
once it has been seen and smelt one naturally feels that it has been eaten and so is satisfied thus one feels relaxed in mind and body free from attachment to the sense of taste
when the meal is over everything disappears but reappears at the next mealtime
that like the realm of unconditioned nirvana is pure and serene resplendent and blissful
the heavenly beings and humans there have lofty and brilliant wisdom and are masters of the supernatural powers
they are all of one form without any differences but are called heavenly beings and humans simply by analogy with the states of existence in other worlds
they are of noble and majestic countenance unequaled in all the worlds and their appearance is superb unmatched by any being heavenly or human
they are all endowed with bodies of naturalness emptiness and infinity
rewards of a beggar and a king the said to if a beggar in extreme poverty sits by the side of a king how can their appearances be compared replied if such a man sits by the side of a king his emaciated mean and ragged appearance can not be compared with the kings
his appearance is a thousand million or even incalculable times inferior to the kings
what is the reason for this the conditions of a beggar in extreme at the lowest social level with barely enough clothes to cover his body scarcely enough food to sustain his life with hunger and cold always tormenting him and having almost lost in human contact are all the result of his misdeeds in former lives
in the past he did not cultivate roots of virtue but instead accumulated riches without giving anything to others
he became more as his wealth increased desired to obtain more hankered after further acquisitions and gave no thought to good actions
thus he piled up a mountain of evil
when his life ended all his wealth was gone and what he had accumulated with great toil and worry was of no avail to him all passed in vain into the possession of others
having no stock of merit on which to depend and no virtue on which to rely after death he fell into one of the evil realms where he suffered pain for a long period
when his ended he was able to escape but was reborn into a lower class being foolish base and inferior he barely maintains the appearance of a human being
the king of a country is the most honored of all men
this is the reward for virtues accumulated in former lives in which he with a compassionate heart gave generously to many saved people from suffering through kindness and benevolence performed good deeds with sincerity and never disputed with others
when that life ended he was rewarded by rebirth into a higher state
born in a heavenly realm he enjoyed bliss and happiness
his accumulated virtues produced such a surplus of goodness that when he was reborn as a man in this life his birth was into a royal family
being naturally noble his dignified and majestic demeanor commands the respect of his people and superb clothes and sumptuous food are prepared and served to him as he pleases
all this is a reward for virtues from his past lives
comparison between heavens and the pure land the said to what you say is true
even though a king is the noblest of all men and has a regal countenance if he is compared with a monarch he will appear as base and inferior as a beggar beside a king
likewise however excellent and the majestic appearance of such a monarch may be if he is compared with the lord of the heaven of the gods he will also appear incomparably inferior even ten thousands of times more so
again if this heavenly lord is compared with the lord of the sixth heaven he will appear a hundred thousand of times inferior
if the lord of the sixth heaven is compared with a or a dwelling in the land of his countenance and appearance will be far from matching those of the or being a thousand million of times or even incalculable times inferior
pleasures in the pure land the said to and humans in the land of are each provided with robes food and drink flowers perfume ornaments silken and banners and are surrounded by exquisite sounds
their palaces and pavilions are exactly in accordance with the size of their bodies
one two or even innumerable jewels appear before them as soon as they wish
in addition beautiful jewelled fabric covers the ground where all the and humans walk
in that there are innumerable jewelled nets all adorned with of gold thread pearls and a hundred thousand kinds of rare and marvelous treasures
all around the nets hang jewelled bells of the utmost beauty which shine brilliantly
when a natural breeze of virtue arises and gently blows it is moderate in temperature neither cold nor hot refreshing and soft to the senses and moves neither too slowly nor too quickly
when the breeze over the nets and the various jewelled trees countless excellent sounds of the are heard and ten thousand kinds of delicate fragrances of virtue are diffused
if one smells those fragrances ones impurities and passions spontaneously cease to arise
if touched by the breeze itself one enjoys the same pleasure as a monk who has entered the of extinction
flowers and innumerable rays of light emitted from them again as the breeze blows flowers are scattered throughout the they spontaneously divide into different colors not mixed together
they are soft and pleasant to touch glow brilliantly and diffuse rich fragrances
when ones foot is placed on them they sink down four inches but when the foot is lifted they rise to their former level
when the flowers have served their purpose the earth opens up and they vanish leaving the ground clean and without trace of them
at the right moment six times a day the breeze scattering the flowers in this way

fulfillment of the and vows the said to sentient beings who are born in that all reside among those assured of nirvana
the reason is that in that land there are neither beings who are destined to adverse conditions nor those whose destinies are uncertain

all sentient beings who having heard his name rejoice in faith remember him even once and sincerely transfer the merit of virtuous practices to that land aspiring to be born there will attain birth and dwell in the stage of
but excluded are those who have committed the five gravest offenses and abused the right
three grades of aspirants
the higher grade the said to and humans in the worlds of the ten quarters who sincerely aspire to be born in that land can be classified into three grades
the higher grade of aspirants are those who leave their homes and abandon worldly desires to become monks
having awakened aspiration for enlightenment they remember and perform meritorious practices aspiring to be born in his land
when they are about to die together with a host of sages will appear before them
then they will follow him and attain birth in his land
at once they will be born by transformation spontaneously from within
they will dwell in the stage of attain wisdom and be capable of freely exercising supernatural powers
for this reason sentient beings who wish to see while in this world should awaken aspiration for the highest enlightenment do meritorious deeds and aspire to be born in his land
 the middle grade the said to the middle grade of aspirants are the and humans in the worlds of the ten quarters who sincerely desire to be born in that land
although unable to become monks and cultivate much merit they awaken aspiration for the highest enlightenment think on perform some good deeds observe the precepts of abstinence build donate statues give to hang banners light candles scatter flowers burn incense and so forth
they transfer the merit of those practices to his land aspiring to be born there
when they are about to die will manifest his transformed body which is fully possessed of the same radiance and physical characteristics and marks as those of the real and make it appear before them together with a host of sages
then they will follow this transformed and be born in the pure land where they will dwell in the stage of
their virtue and wisdom will be next to those of the higher grade of aspirants
 the lower grade the said to the lower grade of aspirants are the and humans in the worlds of the ten quarters who sincerely desire to be born in that land
although unable to do many meritorious deeds they awaken aspiration for the highest enlightenment and concentrate on even ten times desiring birth in his land
when they hear the profound they joyfully accept it and do not entertain any doubt and so remembering the even once they sincerely aspire to be born in that land
when they are about to die they will see the in a dream
those aspirants too will be born in the pure land
their merit and wisdom will be next to those of the middle grade of aspirants
visit to the pure land from other lands the said to the majestic virtue of is boundless

then the enlightened one changes his countenance and smiles from his mouth come forth innumerable rays of light which illuminate the worlds in the ten quarters
these rays of light return encircle his body three times and enter the crown of his head
all and humans are delighted to see this and are filled with great joy
the exalted being having respectfully arranged his clothes and bowed his head asked the why are you smiling i

arrogant corrupt and indolent people can not readily accept this teaching
but those who have met in their past lives rejoice to hear it
neither nor are able to know the sages mind exhaustively they are like those who are born blind and yet wish to guide others
the ocean of the wisdom is deep vast and boundless
even sages of the can not fathom it only the clearly knows it
let us suppose that all human beings without exception have attained enlightenment and with pure wisdom realized original emptiness
even if they pondered on the wisdom for of and expounded it with the utmost effort all through their lives they would not come to exhaustive knowledge of it
the wisdom is thus limitless and pure to its depths
to obtain human life is difficult in the extreme to meet a in this world is also difficult it is difficult too for a man to attain faith and wisdom
once you have heard the strive to reach its heart
if you have heard the and do not forget it but adore and it with great joy you are my good friend
for this reason you should awaken aspiration for enlightenment
even if the whole world is on fire be sure to pass through it to hear the then you will surely attain the enlightenment

each in the of light for one fathom around his body
the light of a shines a hundred
there are two who are the most dignified their majestic light shines everywhere in the universe of a thousand million worlds
asked what are the names of those two the replied one is called and the other
they had both performed practices in this world and at the end of their lives were born by transformation in that
the sentient beings born there all fully possess the physical characteristics of a great man as well as perfect wisdom with which they penetrate deeply into the nature of all and reach their subtle essence

the said to by the power of that land go to innumerable worlds of the ten quarters in as short a time as it takes to eat a meal in order to pay homage and make offerings to the the ones

they are rare and marvelous unlike anything in this world
they are accordingly offered to the assemblies of and
the flowers remain in the sky and gather into
their brilliance is dazzling and their fragrance pervades everywhere

of that land have innumerable virtues such as these of which i have given you only an outline
if i were to them in full detail a thousand million would not be long enough to do so
three kinds of evil passions and their consequences the said to the and to and humans the virtue and wisdom of and in the land of are indescribable
that land is sublime blissful serene and pure
why do you not diligently practice good reflect on the naturalness of the way and realize that it is above all and is pervasive you should each make a great effort to attain it
strive to escape from and be born in the land of peace and provision
then the causes of the five evil realms having been destroyed they will naturally cease to be and so you will progress in your pursuit of the way
the pure land is easy to reach but very few actually go there
it rejects nobody but naturally and unfailingly attracts beings
why do you not abandon worldly matters and strive to enter the way if you do you will obtain an infinitely long life and one of limitless bliss
people of the world being weak in virtue engage in strife over matters which are not urgent
in the midst of abject wickedness and extreme afflictions they painstakingly toil for their living
whether noble or corrupt rich or poor young or old male or female all people worry about wealth and property
in this there is no difference between the rich and the poor both have their anxieties
groaning in dejection and sorrow they pile up thoughts of anguish or driven by inner urges they run wildly in all directions and they have no time for peace and rest
for example if they own fields they are concerned about them
if they have houses they worry about them
they are also anxious about their six kinds of domestic animals such as cows and horses about their male and female servants money wealth clothes food and furnishings
with deepening troubles they sigh repeatedly and anxiety increasingly and terrifies them
sudden misfortune may befall them all their possessions may be destroyed by fire swept away by floods by robbers or seized by adversaries or creditors
then gnawing grief them and incessantly troubles their hearts
anger their minds keeps them in constant agitation increasingly its grip their hearts and never leaves them
when their lives end in such agonizing conditions they must leave everybody and everything behind
even nobles and men of wealth have these worries
with much anxiety and fear they endure such
breaking out in cold or they suffer unremitting pain
the poor and the underprivileged are constantly destitute
if for example they have no fields they are unhappy and want them
if they have no houses they are unhappy and want them
if they have none of the six kinds of domestic animals such as cows and horses or if they have no male and female servants or lack money wealth clothes food or furnishings they are unhappy and want those as well
if they possess some of them others may be lacking
if they have this they do not have that and so they wish to possess all
but even if by some chance they come to possess everything it will soon be destroyed or lost
then and they strive to obtain such things again but it may be impossible
brooding over this is to no avail
exhausted in mind and body they become restless in all their doings and anxieties follow on their heels
such are the troubles they must endure
breaking out in cold or they suffer unremitting pain
such conditions may result in the sudden end of their lives or an early death
since they have not done any good in particular nor followed the way nor acted when they die they will depart alone to an inferior world
although they are destined to different states of existence none of them understands the law of that sends them there
people of the world parents and children brothers and sisters husbands and wives and other family members and should respect and love each other from hatred and envy
they should share things with others and not be greedy and always speak friendly words with a pleasing smile and not hurt each other
if one disagrees with others and grows angry however small ones grudge and enmity may be in this life these will increase in the life to come until they grow into a mass of hostility
for if people are engaged in tormenting and each other in this life such conflict may not immediately end in mutual destruction
but persistent bitterness and raging fury are impressed upon the mind and thus naturally leave indelible marks on consciousness so that those involved will be reborn about the same time to take revenge on each other
further in the midst of worldly desires and attachments one comes and goes alone is born alone and dies alone
after death one goes to a painful or to a pleasant state of existence
each receives his consequences and nobody else can take his place
in accordance with different acts of good and evil people are destined to realms of bliss or suffering
bound by their they depart for those realms all alone
having reached the other world they can not see each other
the law of good and evil naturally pursues them and wherever they may be reborn distance and darkness always separate them
since their paths of are different it is impossible to tell the time of their reunion and so difficult to meet again
can they ever see each other once more why do they not abandon all worldly involvements and strive while they are strong and healthy to pursue the good and diligently seek deliverance from if they do they will be able to attain infinite life
why do they not seek the way what is there in this world that should be longed for what pleasure is there that ought to be sought after thus people of the world do not believe in pursuing good and receiving reward or in practicing the way and attaining enlightenment neither do they believe in and retribution for evil acts or reward for good ones such as obtaining merit by helping others
believing that these do not exist they totally reject such a view
further by so doing they cling to their own views more tenaciously
later generations learn from previous ones to act likewise
fathers perpetuating their wrong views pass them on to their children
since parents and grandparents from the beginning did not do good deeds were ignorant of the way committed foolish acts and were benighted insensitive and callous their descendants are now unable to realize the truth of and the law of
there is no one to tell them about this
nobody seeks to know the cause of fortune and misfortune happiness and misery although these states result from such acts
the reality of is such that the sorrow of parting is mutually felt by all generations
a father cries over the death of his children children cry over the death of their father
brothers sisters husbands and wives mourn each others death
according to the basic law of whether death will occur in order of seniority or in the reverse is unpredictable
all things must pass
nothing stays forever
few believe this even if someone teaches and them
and so the stream of continues everlastingly
because they are stupid and callous such people do not accept the teachings of the they lack forethought and only wish to satisfy their own desires
they are deluded by their passionate attachments unaware of the way misguided and trapped by anger and enmity and intent on gaining wealth and gratifying their carnal desires like wolves
and so unable to follow the way they are again subject to suffering in evil realms in an endless cycle of
how miserable and pitiable this is in the same family when one of the parents children brothers sisters husband or wife dies those surviving mourn over the loss and their attachment to the deceased persists
deep sorrow fills their hearts and they mournfully think of the departed
days pass and years go by but their distress goes on
even if someone teaches them the way their minds are not awakened
brooding over fond memories of the dead they can not rid themselves of attachment
being ignorant inert and they are unable to think deeply to keep their to practice the way with diligence and to themselves from worldly matters
as they wander here and there they come to their end and die before entering on the way
then what can be done for them because they are spiritually deeply troubled and confused people indulge their passions
hence many are ignorant of the way and few realize it
everyone is restlessly busy having nothing upon which to rely
whether moral or corrupt of high or low rank rich or poor noble or base all are preoccupied with their own work
they entertain venomous thoughts creating a widespread and dismal atmosphere of malevolence
subversive activities are planned contrary to the universal law and the wishes of the people
injustice and vice inevitably follow and are allowed to run their course unchecked until evil accumulates to the limit
before they expect their lives to end people meet sudden death and fall into evil realms where they will suffer excruciating for many lives
b they will not be able to escape for many thousands of of
how painful how pitiable that is encouragement to do good the said to the and to and humans i have told you the truth about people of the world
such being their mode of life they are unable to enter on the way
therefore you should think deeply and try to avoid various evil acts choose the good and diligently practice it
a life of addiction to desires or a life of pomp and can not last long
all must part there is nothing you can truly enjoy
since you have encountered a in this world you should practice the way
anyone who sincerely desires birth in the land of peace and bliss is able to attain purity of wisdom and supremacy in virtue
you should not follow the urges of passions break the precepts or fall behind others in the practice of the way
if you have doubts and are not clear about my teaching ask me the about anything and i shall explain it to you
the himself on the ground and said your majestic glory o is and your exposition is most pleasing to me
having heard your teaching i feel deeply that people of the world are just as you have described
your compassionate revelation of the great way has opened our eyes and ears awakening us to emancipation
those who have heard your teachings are all filled with joy
humans and lesser beings including even those that crawl have all been blessed by your compassionate guidance and have thereby attained deliverance from suffering and affliction
the admonition is indeed profound and appropriate and his wisdom clearly surveys things in the eight quarters above and below penetrating all in the past present and future
our emancipation in the present life is entirely due to the perseverance and painstaking efforts in his former lives when he was seeking the way
his benevolence covers the whole world and the extent of his merit is majestic and glorious
his light to the utmost ends of space and guides people to nirvana
he reveals the wrong views and subdues demons
thus his influence extends in the ten quarters
the is the king of the his virtue that of all the sages
he is the teacher of all and humans and enables them to enter on the way according to their wishes
having been able to meet you o and also to hear the name of we have all attained joy and illumination
admonition against evil acts the said to what you say is true
those who adore and a attain great merit
very rarely appear in the world
having become a in this life i have taught the expounded teachings of the way cleared peoples doubts the causes of lust and desire and blocked the source of all evils
visiting various places in the three worlds i encounter no
the wisdom disclosed in the scriptures provides for all ways of life
it keeps essential principles together and clearly reveals the truth
i have explained the reality of the five realms thereby freeing those who have not yet attained deliverance and distinguishing between the paths of and nirvana
you should know that you have for innumerable been perfecting practices to save sentient beings
incalculable indeed is the number of beings who under your guidance have attained the way and reached nirvana
from time immemorial you and all the and humans in the ten quarters and the four groups of followers have been floundering in the five realms of undergoing indescribable troubles and afflictions
until you were born in this life you too underwent endless cycles of
now you have encountered a listened to his expositions of the and been able to learn about
what pleasure and joy this is for you and for me to share
it is time for all to seek deliverance from the pains of birth death old age and sickness
of depravity and are everywhere and there is nothing in which you can find true joy
you should resolutely do worthy deeds with decorum strive to do more good control and purify yourselves wash off the minds be sincere in word and deed and allow no contradiction between what you think and what you do
seek your own emancipation and then turn to saving others aspire to be born in the pure land and accumulate roots of virtue
however hard you may practice in this life it can only be for a short while
in the life to come you will be born in the land of and enjoy endless bliss there
being forever in accord with the way you will no longer be subject to and be free of the afflictions caused by greed anger and stupidity
if you wish your life to be as long as a a hundred or ten million it will be just as you please
you will dwell in effortless spontaneity and attain nirvana
you should each diligently seek to realize your aspiration
do not entertain any doubt or give up your endeavor lest as a result of that fault you should be born into the palace in the border region of the pure land and be subject to various disadvantages for five hundred years
said to the having received your considerate admonition we will diligently practice the way and follow your teaching
we will not allow any doubt to arise
admonition against five evils the said to if here in this world you are upright in thought and will and abstain from doing evil then you will attain the utmost virtue unsurpassed in all the lands throughout the ten quarters
why is this so and humans in the naturally do good and rarely commit evil and so it is easy to teach and train them
having become a in this world i now dwell in the midst of the five evils the five sufferings and the five burnings
this is extremely painful for me
i will teach multitudes of beings making them abandon the five evils avoid the five sufferings and escape from the five burnings
i will train their minds and lead them to practice the five good deeds so that they may acquire merit and virtue and attain emancipation long life and nirvana
the continued what are the five evils what are the five sufferings what are the five burnings what is the way to extinguish the five evils and lead people to practice the five good deeds so that they may acquire merit and virtue and attain emancipation long life and nirvana first evil the said the first evil is this
humans and lesser beings including even those that crawl are bent on doing evil
there is no being that is not
the strong subdue the weak all inflict serious injuries and kill each other all devour their prey
not knowing how to do good they commit evil and do outrageous and unruly deeds
later they receive retribution a it is natural that they should be destined to evil realms
keep records of offenders acts and make sure that they are punished
that is why some are poor and destitute corrupt lonely deaf dumb blind stupid wicked physically handicapped deranged or subnormal
but others are honorable noble wealthy intelligent or clever
this is the result of good and meritorious acts of benevolence and the performance of their duties to their parents in past lives
in this world prisons are set up by the law and those who are unafraid of them and commit offenses are sent there for punishment
however desperately they may wish to escape it is impossible to do so
such is retribution in this world but in the lives to come punishment is longer and more severe for such evildoers
the suffering of through dark and dismal realms is comparable to the and most painful punishment ever enforced by law
thus through the natural working of they undergo immeasurable suffering in the three evil realms
in successive they are reborn into different forms their are sometimes long and sometimes short
their transient selves vital energy and consciousness through the natural working of
although each individual is reborn alone those bound by common come to be born together and take revenge upon each other
so this condition persists endlessly and until the effect of their evil is exhausted there is no possibility of avoiding their enemies
floundering in they have no chance of escape or of attaining emancipation
the pain that they must undergo is indescribable
since this law naturally everywhere between heaven and earth even if good or evil acts do not immediately bring about reward or retribution they will certainly result sooner or later
this i call the first great evil the first suffering and the first burning
those afflictions are such that they are comparable to a huge fire burning people alive
if in the midst of this one controls ones thoughts with does worthy deeds with proper demeanor commits no evil and performs only good then with the merit and virtue acquired one reaches emancipation and is able to escape from this world be reborn in heavenly realms and finally reach nirvana
this is the first great good
second evil the continued the second evil is that people of the world parents children brothers and sisters members of a family husbands and wives all lack moral principles break laws conduct themselves arrogantly commit and unruly acts pursue their own pleasures enjoy themselves as they will and deceive each other
what they think contradicts what they say they speak without sincerity flatter others with deceitful intention fawn upon others with artful words envy the reputation of sages abuse the virtuous and people by dishonest means
masters are unwise in appointing retainers who exploiting the situation seek every opportunity for and deceit
rulers being are deceived by ministers and foolishly remove loyal and faithful subjects
this is contrary to the will of heaven
ministers betray their rulers children deceive their parents brothers sisters husbands wives and friends deceive each other
they harbor greed anger and stupidity and desiring many possessions seek their own advantage
all people are the same at heart whether they are men of high and honorable positions or of lower and despised classes
they bring their homes and themselves to ruin and recklessly destroy their kindred
although there are family members friends villagers ignorant b and vulgar groups working together all seek to gain their own profit thereby incurring the anger and enmity of others
when people grow rich they become and
greedily attached to their wealth they toil with mind and body to retain it
when their end comes they find nothing to rely on
ultimately they are born and depart alone with nobody to accompany them
bliss or misery resulting from good or evil acts follows them in their future lives
thus they are reborn in pleasant or painful states
even if they later show regret what good will that do people of the world being and lacking insight hate and abuse good people and show them no respect
they are attached to wrongdoing and willfully commit unlawful acts
they always covet the wealth of others and harbor intentions of stealing
after spending and what they have robbed from others they seek to regain it
because of their own hidden motives and dishonesty they slyly study the reactions shown on the faces of others
since they are unable to think far ahead when things go wrong they become despondent with chagrin
in this world there are prisons established by the law where offenders are sent to receive punishment according to their offenses
in their previous lives they neither believed in the way nor cultivated roots of virtue
in this life too if they commit evil know and keep records of their acts when they die they fall into evil realms
thus because of the natural working of there are the three evil realms and innumerable sufferings through which evildoers must pass life after life for many with no end in sight
it is indeed difficult for them to attain release
the pain they must undergo is indescribable
this is called the second great evil the second suffering and the second burning
the afflictions are such that they are comparable to a huge fire burning people alive
if in the midst of this one controls ones thoughts with does worthy deeds with proper demeanor commits no evil and performs only good then with the merit and virtue acquired one reaches emancipation and is able to escape from this world be reborn in heavenly realms and finally reach nirvana
this is the second great good
the third evil the continued the third evil is this
people of the world live together inhabiting this realm between heaven and earth with a limited
on the one hand among the higher levels there are wise rich honorable noble and wealthy people
on the other hand among the lower levels there are people who are poor crude and foolish
besides there are evildoers who always harbor vicious thoughts and think only of they are full of worries sunk in lust and attachment are restless in their daily lives greedy and and desirous of what they have no right to possess
they over women behave and commit obscene acts with them hate their own wives and secretly frequent brothels
consequently after all their resources they begin to break the law
they form bands start riots engage in fighting attack and kill people and plunder property
some have evil designs on the possessions of others
without working at their own occupations they acquire things through theft
driven by desire they commit further offenses
feverishly agitated they intimidate and rob people to support their own wives and children with the goods thus acquired
obeying only the dictates of their passions they become addicted to wanton pleasures
they also disregard seniority in kinship causing sorrow and anguish to other family members and relatives furthermore they take no account of the laws of the state
but such evils are known to others and also to demons
the sun and the moon recognize them and keep records of their doings
thus because of the natural working of there are three evil realms and innumerable sufferings through which evildoers must pass life after life for many with no end in sight
it is indeed difficult for them to gain release
the pain they must undergo is indescribable
this is called the third great evil the third suffering and the third burning
the afflictions are such that they are comparable to a huge fire burning people alive
if in the midst of this one controls ones thoughts with does worthy deeds with proper demeanor commits no evil and performs only good then with the merit and virtue acquired one reaches emancipation and is able to escape from this world be reborn in heavenly realms and finally reach nirvana
this is the third great good
the fourth evil the continued the fourth evil is this
people of the world do not think of doing good
they incite each other to commit various kinds of evil uttering harsh and abusive words telling lies and engaging in idle talk
they others and cause contention
they hate and envy good men and ruin the wise while they rejoice in watching this behind the scenes
they are of their parents make light of their teachers and elders fail to win the trust of their friends and lack sincerity
holding themselves in high esteem they think that they are virtuous but act in an overbearing manner and despise others
unaware of their own evil they never feel ashamed of themselves
of their physical strength they demand respect and fear from others
taking no heed of heaven earth or the sun and the moon they disdain to do any good
so they are difficult to train and convert
holding themselves in high esteem they demand their own way
arrogant and afraid of nothing they always assume a haughty attitude
but keep record of their evils
perhaps there was some meritorious act in their past lives and they can count on the effect of that small amount of good
but since they commit evil again in this life their stock of merit is soon exhausted good divinities forsake them leaving them alone and with no one on whom to depend
when their lives end all their evil upon them and forces them through the natural working of to descend to the evil realms
again as the exact record of their deeds in the hands of the dictates their and offenses condemn them to realm
retribution for evil comes about naturally and nothing can stop it
they must go into the where their bodies are melted down with the utmost torment and anguish
even if at that time they repent of their evil deeds what good will that do the way of heaven takes its inevitable course without mistake
thus because of the natural working of there are the three evil realms and innumerable kinds of suffering through which evildoers must pass life after life for many with no end in sight
it is indeed difficult for them to gain release and the pain they must undergo is indescribable
this is called the fourth great evil the fourth suffering and the fourth burning
the afflictions are such that they are comparable to a huge fire burning people alive
if in the midst of this one controls ones thoughts with does worthy deeds with proper demeanor commits no evil and performs only good then with the merit and virtue acquired one reaches emancipation and is able to escape from this world be reborn in heavenly realms and finally reach nirvana
this is the fourth great good
the fifth evil the continued the fifth evil is this
people of the world are indecisive and slothful reluctant to do good lacking in and not working hard at their occupations so their families and dependents are left to suffer from hunger and cold
when by their parents they retort angrily with scornful looks
with such conflicts they are far from peaceful they can be as violent and frenzied as enemies confronting each other and as a result parents wish that they had no children
in dealing with others they are and wayward causing trouble and annoyance to many
even when they are morally obliged to others they neglect their duties and have no intention of their
destitute and driven to the most desperate ends they have no way of regaining their wealth
although eager to obtain much profit and appropriate the riches of others they waste their money on wanton pleasures
as this becomes a habit they grow accustomed to acquiring property illegally and to spending their profits on personal luxuries indulging in wine and sumptuous food they eat and drink to excess
and as they are they engage in foolish quarrels
unable to understand others they forcibly impose their will upon them
when they come upon people who are good they hate and abuse them
lacking ethics and decorum they do not reflect on their conduct and so are presumptuous and insistent refusing to take the advice and admonitions of others
they are unconcerned if their from the closest to the sixth have no means of livelihood
they disregard their parents benevolence and do not fulfill obligations to their teachers and friends
they think only of doing evil their mouths continuously speak malice and with their bodies they are forever committing evil
in their whole lives they have not done even one good deed
furthermore they do not believe in the ancient sages nor the teachings nor the path of practice leading to emancipation
neither do they believe that after death one is reborn into another state of existence that good deeds bring about good rewards or that evil acts bring about evil consequences
they plot to murder an to cause disruption in the and even think of killing their parents brothers sisters or other relatives
for this reason even their from the closest to the sixth hate them so much as to wish them dead
such people of the world are all of the same mind
they are foolish and ignorant lacking the wisdom to know whence they have come into life nor they are going after death
neither humane toward others nor obedient to their elders they revel against the whole world
nevertheless they expect good fortune and seek long lives only to meet death in the end
even if someone compassionately them trying to lead them to thoughts of goodness and teaches them that naturally there are good and evil realms of they will not believe him
however hard one may try to persuade them it is useless
their minds are closed and they refuse to listen to others or understand their teachings
when their lives are about to end fear and revulsion arise in turn
not having previously done any good they are filled with remorse when they come to their end
but what good will that do then between heaven and earth the five realms are clearly distinguishable
they are vast and deep extending
in return for good or evil deeds bliss or misery ensues
the result of ones must be borne by oneself alone and no one else can take ones place
this is the natural law
misfortune follows evil deeds as their retribution which is impossible to avoid
good people do good deeds and so enjoy pleasure after pleasure and proceed from light to greater light
evildoers commit crimes and so suffer pain after pain and wander from darkness to deeper darkness
no one except the knows this completely
even though someone and teaches them very few believe and so the cycles of never cease and the evil paths continue endlessly
b the consequences for such worldly people are beyond description in detail
thus because of the natural working of there are innumerable kinds of suffering in the three evil realms through which evil beings must pass life after life for many with no end in sight
it is indeed difficult for them to gain release and the pain they must undergo is indescribable
this is called the fifth great evil the fifth suffering and the fifth burning
the afflictions are such that they are comparable to a huge fire burning people alive
if in the midst of this one controls ones thoughts with does worthy deeds with proper demeanor words and deeds acts with sincerity true words speaks from the heart commits no evil and performs only good then with the merit and virtue acquired one reaches emancipation and is able to escape from this world be reborn in heavenly realms and finally reach nirvana
this is the fifth great good
further admonition by the the said to i shall explain further
such are the afflictions of the five evils in this world
the five sufferings and the five burnings continue to arise from them
people commit nothing but evil and fail to cultivate roots of virtue and so it is natural that they all go to evil realms
even in this life they suffer from incurable illnesses
longing for death they can not die craving for life they can not live
thus they are an example to others of what retribution for evil acts is like
after death driven by their they fall into the three evil realms where they suffer countless tortures and are themselves consigned to the flames
after a long time they are reborn again in this world only to hatred against each other
at first hatred is slight but finally develops into a major evil
all this is because of their greedy attachment to wealth and sensuous pleasures and of their refusal to share with others
further wayward thoughts arise from the desires born of stupidity
their bondage to evil passions will never be severed
in the pursuit of selfish gain there is no chance for them to reflect on their evils and turn to good
when wealthy and prosperous they are happy and do not learn to be modest and virtuous
consequently their pomp and power are when these are exhausted they must undergo further afflictions
their sufferings are bound to increase in time to come
the law of operates like a net stretched everywhere in its it inevitably catches all offenders
the net woven of large and small ropes covers the whole world from top to bottom and those caught in it feel utterly helpless and tremble in fear
this net has been in existence from of old
how painful and the said to people of this world are as i have described
all the pity them and with divine powers destroy their evils and lead them all to goodness
if you give up wrong views hold fast to the scriptures and the precepts and practice the way without committing any fault then you will finally be able to attain the path to emancipation and nirvana
the continued you and other and humans of the present and people of future generations having received the teachings should reflect upon them and while following them should remain upright in thought and do virtuous deeds
rulers should abide by morality reign with beneficence and decree that everyone should maintain proper conduct the sages respect men of virtue be benevolent and kind to others and take care not to disregard the teachings and admonitions
all should seek emancipation cut the roots of and its various evils and so aspire to escape from the paths of immeasurable sorrow fear and pain in the three evil realms
in this world you should extensively plant roots of virtue be benevolent give generously abstain from breaking the precepts be patient and diligent teach people with sincerity and wisdom do virtuous deeds and practice good
if you strictly observe the precepts of abstinence with upright thought and even for a day and a night the merit acquired will surpass that of practicing good in the land of for a hundred years
the reason is that in that of effortless spontaneity all the inhabitants do good without committing even a hairs breadth of evil
if in this world you do good for ten days and nights the merit acquired will surpass that of practicing good in the of other quarters for a thousand years
the reason is that in the of other quarters many practice good and very few commit evil
they are lands where everything is naturally provided as a result of ones merit and virtue and so no evil is done
but in this world much evil is committed and few are provided for naturally people must work hard to get what they want
since they intend to deceive each other their minds are troubled their bodies exhausted and they drink bitterness and eat hardship
in this way they are preoccupied with their toil no have time for rest
out of pity for you and other and humans i have taken great pains in exhorting you to do good deeds
i have given you instructions appropriate to your capacities
you have without fail accepted my teachings and practiced them and so have all entered on the way as you wished
wherever the comes to stay there is no state town or village which is not blessed by his virtues
the whole country in peace and harmony
the sun and the moon shine with pure brilliance wind rises and rain falls at the right time
there is no calamity or epidemic and so the country becomes wealthy and its people enjoy peace
soldiers and weapons become useless and people esteem virtue practice benevolence and diligently cultivate courteous modesty
the continued my concern for you and humans is greater than the care of parents for their children
i have become a in this world destroyed the five evils removed the five sufferings and extinguished the five burnings
i have countered evil with good the suffering of and enabled people to acquire the five virtues and attain the peace of unconditioned nirvana
but after i have departed from this world my teaching will gradually decline and people will fall prey to flattery and deceit and commit various evils resulting in the recurrence of the five sufferings and the five burnings
as time goes on their sufferings will intensify
as it is impossible to describe this in detail i have given you only a brief outline
the said to you should each ponder on this well teach and each other and be on guard against disobeying the instruction
the with his palms together said o how sincere and earnest your admonition is people of the world are just as you have described
o you take pity on and care for us without discrimination and seek to deliver us all from suffering
having accepted the repeated exhortations i will be careful not to them
and the pure land shown to the audience the said to rise to your feet rearrange your robes put your palms together and respectfully and worship
and in the lands of the ten quarters always praise with one accord that virtues of and activity
stood up rearranged his robes assumed the correct posture faced westward and demonstrating his sincere reverence joined his palms together himself on the ground and worshipped
then he said a to the one i wish to see that his land of peace and bliss and its hosts of and
as soon as he had said this emitted a great light which illuminated all the
the mountains mount together with large and small mountains and everything else shone with the same golden color
that light was like the flood at the end of the period of cosmic change that fills the whole world when of things are submerged and as far as the eye can see there is nothing but a vast expanse of water
even so was the flood of light emanating from
all the lights of and were and surpassed and only the light remained shining bright and glorious
at that time saw the splendor and majesty of resembling mount which rises above the whole world
there was no place which was not illuminated by the light emanating from his body of glory
the four groups of followers of the in the assembly saw all this at the same time
likewise those of the pure land saw everything in this world
two kinds of birth in the pure land then the said to and the have you seen that land filled with excellent and glorious manifestations all spontaneously produced from the ground to the heaven of pure abode replied yes i have
the asked have you also heard the great voice of the to all the worlds guiding sentient beings to the way of the replied yes i have
the further asked have you also seen the inhabitants of that land move freely riding in airborne palaces as large as a hundred thousand to worship the of the lands in the ten quarters yes i have replied
have you also seen that some of the inhabitants are in the embryonic state yes i have
those in the embryonic state dwell in palaces as high as a hundred or five hundred where they spontaneously enjoy pleasures as do those in the heaven of the gods
the cause of the two kinds of birth then the said to the one for what reason are some of the inhabitants of that land in the embryonic state and the others born by transformation the replied if there are sentient beings who do various meritorious deeds aspiring for birth in that land while still entertaining doubt such beings are unable to comprehend the inconceivable wisdom ineffable wisdom boundless wisdom and incomparable unequaled and unsurpassed supreme wisdom
although they doubt these they still believe in retribution for evil and reward for virtue and so cultivate a stock of merits aspiring for birth in that land
such beings are born in a palace where they dwell for five hundred years without being able to behold the hear his exposition of the or see the hosts of and
for this reason that type of birth in the pure land is called embryonic state
if there are sentient beings who with resolute faith accept these kinds of wisdom from the wisdom to the supreme wisdom do meritorious deeds and sincerely transfer the merit acquired to that land b those beings will be born by transformation spontaneously
seated with legs crossed in the and instantly attain the same glorious forms wisdom and virtue as those of other there
encouragement of faith further if great in the of other quarters desire to see and and make offerings to him and the hosts of and they will after death be born in the land of
spontaneously transformed they will be born from within the
you should know that those born by transformation are possessed of supreme wisdom while those in the embryonic state lack that wisdom and must pass five hundred years without being able to see the hear his teaching of the see the hosts of and make offerings to the learn the rules of conduct for or perform meritorious practices
you should know that this is because those beings harbored doubt and lacked wisdom in their previous lives
embryonic birth the said to let us suppose that a monarch has a special chamber which is adorned with seven jewels and provided with curtained couches and silken banners hanging from the ceiling
if princes have committed offense against the king they are taken to that chamber and with gold chains
there they are served with food and drink provided with clothes couches and cushions flowers and incense and can enjoy music
being treated just like the monarch himself they have no wants
do you think that those princes would enjoy living there no they do not replied
they would seek various means of approach to ask a man of power to help them escape
the said to those beings born within the are like that
because of their doubt in the wisdom they have been born in palaces
although they receive no punishment or ill treatment even for a single moment they must pass five hundred years there without being able to see the three treasures make offerings to the or cultivate a stock of virtue
this is distressing to them
though there are other pleasures they do not enjoy living there
if those beings become aware of the faults committed in their former lives and deeply repent they can as they wish leave and go to where dwells
then they can worship and make offerings to him they can also visit innumerable and countless other to perform various meritorious practices
you should know that the who allow doubt to arise lose great benefits
for this reason you should have resolute faith in the supreme wisdom of the
visits to the pure land from other the said to the one how many are there in this world who will be born in that the replied of from this world will be born there
each of these has previously made offerings to innumerable with almost as much diligence as you did
furthermore of lesser practices and those who have performed small acts of merit whose number is beyond calculation will all be born there
the said to not only those from this world but also those from in other quarters are born there
first in the land of the named illumination there are one hundred and eighty of who all visit there
second in the land of the there are ninety of who all visit there
third in the land of the immeasurable sound there are two hundred and twenty of who all visit there
fourth in the land of the taste of nectar there are two hundred and fifty of who all visit there
fifth in the land of the there are fourteen of who all visit there
sixth in the land of the superior power there are fourteen thousand who all visit there
seventh in the land of the lion there are five hundred of who all visit there
eighth in the land of the light there are eighty of who all visit there
ninth in the land of the peak of virtue there are sixty of who all visit there
tenth in the land of the mountain of excellent virtue there are sixty of who all visit there
eleventh in the land of the king of men there are ten of who all visit there
twelfth in the land of the splendid flower there are innumerable and incalculable who are all and possessed of wisdom who have previously made offerings to countless and are able to learn in seven days the teachings of the that can only be attained by after practicing for a hundred thousand of
those all visit there
thirteenth in the land of the there are seven hundred and ninety of great and incalculable minor and who all visit there
the said to not only do the from those fourteen visit that land but also from innumerable in the ten quarters whose number is incalculable
even if i were to give you only the names of the in the ten quarters and the number of the and who visit that land them continuously day and night for a i would not be able to complete the list
this is why i have given you only a brief description
a encouragement to accept this the said to if there are people who hear the name of that rejoice so greatly as to dance and remember him even once then you should know that they have gained great benefit by receiving the unsurpassed virtue
for this reason even if a great fire were to fill the universe of a thousand million worlds you should pass through it to hear this to arouse joyful faith to uphold and chant it and to practice in accordance with its teachings
this is because there are many who wish to hear this teaching but are still unable to do so
if there are sentient beings who have heard it they will attain the stage of for realizing the highest enlightenment
this is why you should accept in faith uphold and chant this and practice in accordance with its teaching
the further said i have expounded this teaching for the sake of sentient beings and enabled you to see and all in his land
strive to do what you should
after i have passed into nirvana do not allow doubt to arise
in the future the scriptures and teachings will perish
but out of pity and compassion i will especially preserve this and maintain it in the world for a hundred years more
those beings who encounter it will attain deliverance in accord with their aspirations
the said to it is difficult to encounter and behold when he is in this world
difficult of access difficult to hear are the teachings and scriptures
it is also difficult to hear the excellent teachings for the
difficult too is it to meet a good teacher to hear the and perform the practices
but most difficult of all difficulties is to hear this have faith in it with joy and hold fast to it
nothing is more difficult than this
thus have i formed my thus have i expounded my and thus have i taught my
you must receive it and practice it by the method prescribed
when the one had finished his exposition of this aspiration for the highest enlightenment was awakened in innumerable sentient beings
twelve thousand of human beings attained the pure of and humans attained the stage of a eight hundred thousand realized the wisdom of destroying forty of attained the stage of and all adorned with the virtue of the universal vows will ultimately attain perfect enlightenment
at that time the entire universe of a thousand million worlds shook in six ways and a great light illuminated all the lands in the ten quarters
a hundred thousand kinds of music played spontaneously and innumerable marvelous flowers fell in profusion from the sky
when the finished delivering this the and from the lands in the ten quarters together with the elder other great and all those in the assembly without exception rejoiced at the discourse
it is most convenient to mark the circle with chalk paint or otherwise to show where it is but marks on the carpet may be utilized
furniture may be placed to indicate the bounds
the only circle that matters is the one drawn before every ceremony with either a duly magic sword or an
the circle is usually nine feet in diameter unless made for some very special purpose
there are two outer circles each six inches apart so the third circle has a diameter of eleven feet
having chosen a place proper take the or scimitar of art or a if thou obtain it and stick it into the center then take a cord and well to use the cable tow for this and loop it over the instrument four and one half feet and so trace out the circumference of the circle which must be traced either with the sword or the knife with the black hilt or it be of little avail but ever leave open a door towards the north
make in all circles one within the other and write names of power between these

of old there were many chants and songs used especially in the dances
many of these have been forgotten by us here but we know that they used cries of which seems like the cries or of the ancients
much on the if this be so
in my youth when i heard it seemed to be or rather
this may be but the natural way to prolong it to make it fit for a call but it suggests that these be possibly the initials of an invocation as is said to be and of said that the whole alphabet is said to be such and for this reason is recited as a most powerful charm but at least this is certain these cries during the dances do have profound effect as i myself have seen
other calls are and also
may be a spell but is more likely to be a call
like the of the and the heave of sailors
and ab ab seem calls as horse and horse and go horse and thout tout a tout tout throughout and about and are probably attempts at a forgotten formula though they may have been invented by some unfortunate being tortured to evade telling the real formula
ever remember the promise of the goddess for ecstasy is mine and joy on earth so let there ever be joy in your heart
greet people with joy be glad to see them
if times be hard think it might have been worse
i at least have known the joys of the and i will know them again
think of the grandeur beauty and poetry of the rites of the loved ones you meet through them
if you dwell on this inner joy your health will be better
you must try to banish all fear for it will really touch you
it may hurt your body but your soul is beyond it all
and ever remember that if you help others it makes you forget your own
and if another be in pain do what you may to distract his attention from it
do not say you have no pain but if you may administer the drugs which as well as those that cure
but ever strive to make them believe they are getting better
install into them happy thoughts
if you can only get this into his inner mind so that it be always believed
to this end it is not wrong to let people think that we of the cult have more power than we have
for the truth is that if they believe we have more power than we really possess we do really possess these powers we can do good to them
you must try to find out about people
if you tell a slightly sick man you are looking better
you will soon be well he will feel better but if he is really ill or in pain his knowledge that he is in pain will cause him to doubt your words in future
but if you give him one of the drugs and then say the pain is growing less
soon it will be gone because the pain goes the next time you say the pain is going he will believe you and the pain will really get less
but you must ever say so with conviction and this conviction must come from your believing it yourself because you yourself know that if you can fix his mind so that he believes you it is true
often better to look exactly between their eyes looking as if your eyes pierced their heads opening your eyes as wide as you may and never blink
this continued gazing oft causes the patient to grow sleepy
if they show signs of this say you are growing sleepy
you will sleep you are tired
sleep
your eyes grow tired
sleep
if they close their eyes say your eyes close you are tired you can not open your eyes
if they can not say your arms are tired you can not raise them
if they can not say i am master of your mind
you must ever believe what i tell you
when i look like this into your eyes you will sleep and be subject to my will then tell them they will sleep and wake up refreshed feeling better
continue this with soothing and healing drugs and try to into them the feeling of ecstasy that you feel at the
they can not feel it in full but you can command them to feel what is in your own mind and try to concentrate on this ecstasy
i f you may safely tell that you are of the cult your task may be easier
and it were well to command them to know it only with their sleeping mind and forget it or to be at least unable to tell anyone about it when awake
a good way is to command them that if they are ever questioned about or witches to immediately fall asleep
ever remember if tempted to admit or boast of belonging to the cult you be endangering your brothers for though now the fires of persecution may have died down who knows when they may be revived many priests have knowledge of our secrets and they well know that though much religious bigotry has calmed down many people would wish to join our cult
and if the truth were known of its joys the churches would lose power so if we take many recruits we may loose the fires of persecution against us a gain
so ever keep the secrets
think joy think love try to help others and bring joy into their lives
children are naturally easier to influence than grown people
ever strive to work through peoples existing beliefs
for instance more than half of the world believe in amulets
an ordinary stone is not an amulet but if it hath a natural hole in it it must be something unusual so if the patient hath this belief give him one
but first carry it next your skin for a few days forcing your will into it to cure pain to feel safe or against their particular fear and this amulet may keep imposing your will when you are absent
the masters of knew this full well when they say they must be made in a circle to avoid distraction by someone whose mind is on the subject of the work
but keep your own mind happy
remember the words of the goddess i give unimaginable joys on earth certainty not faith while in life and upon death peace rest and ecstasy and the promise that you will return again
in the old days many of us went to the flames laughing and singing and so we may again
we may have joy in life and beauty and peace and death and the promise of return
the speaks a merry heart good like a medicine but a broken spirit the bones
but you may not have a merry heart
perchance you were born under an evil star
i think that the effects of the stars are overestimated but you can not make a merry heart to order you say
but you can in the cult there be secret processes by which your will and imagination may be influenced
this process also affects the body and brings it to joy
your body is happy so your mind is happy
you are well because you are happy and you are happy because you are well
prayer may be used with good result if the patient believes it can and will work
many believe it can but do not believe their god or saint will help
prayers to the goddess help especially the horn prayer as it causes stimulation to the body as well as to the mind
feet knees and wrists should be tightly bound to retard blood
scourge or more to make skin then say invoking goddess hail from the horn pour forth thy store of love
i lowly bend before thee i invoke thee at the end when other gods are fallen and put to scorn
thy foot is to my lips my sighs inborn rise touch curl about thy heart
then spend pitiful love loveliest pity descend and bring me luck who am lonely and forlorn
ask the goddess to help you to obtain your desires then scourge again to bind the spell
this be powerful in ill luck and for sickness
it must be said in a circle and you must be properly prepared and well purified both before and after saying to bind the spell
before starting you must make a very clear picture in your mind of what you wish
make yourself see the wish obtained
be sure in your own mind exactly what it is and how it is to be fulfilled
this spell is the one that was taught to me long ago and i have found it works but i think there is any special virtue in these words
any others can be substituted provided they ask the or gods help and say clearly what you wish and you form the clear mental image and if it work at first keep on trying till it works
your helper who the scourge must know what you wish and also form the mental image
and at first at any rate it will be better for you to work the spell then for the girl to take your place and work it also you scourge her
try anything difficult at first and do it at least once a week till it works
you have to get into sympathy with each other before anything happens and regular working helps this
of spells the exact words matter little if the intent be clear and you raise the true power and sufficient thereof
always in rhyme they are
there is something queer about rhyme
i have tried and the same seem to lose their power if you miss the rhyme
also in rhyme the words seem to say themselves
you do not have to pause and think what comes next doing this takes away much of your intent
order and discipline must be kept
a high priest or may and should punish all faults to this end and all of the cult must accept such corrections willingly
all are brothers and sisters for this reason that even the high must submit to the scourge
each fault should be corrected separately
the priest or must be properly prepared and call the culprit to trial
they must be prepared as for initiation and kneel be told their fault and sentence pronounced
punishment should be the scourge followed by a forfeit such as several kisses or something of this nature
the culprit must acknowledge the justice of the punishment by kissing hands and scourge on receiving sentence and again when thanking for punishment received
the are thrice three and thrice seven in all
it is not meet to make offerings of less than two score to the goddess for here be a mystery
the fortunate numbers be and
for three added to two the perfect couple be five
and three and five be eight eight and five be thirteen thirteen and eight be
the kiss is called but there are kisses for there be feet and knees and and breasts and the lips
and times be two score
also fortunate numbers be and which total or two score
for each man and woman hath ten fingers and ten toes so each totals a score
and a perfect couple be two score
so a lesser number would not be perfect prayer
if more are required make it a perfect number as four score or six score
also there be eight elemental weapons
to make the ointment take some glazed pans filled half full with grease or olive oil
put in one sweet mint in another ground in a and it you may have it dried leaves pounded
place pans in hot water bath
stir and cook for several hours then pout into linen bags and squeeze grease through into pans again and fill up with fresh leaves
after doing this several times the grease will be highly perfumed
then mix all together and store in a jar
behind ears throat armpits breasts and womb
also for all ceremonies where the feet are kissed they should also be
one learns to know the body of man through the bodily senses
and the way of observing it can differ in no way from that by which one learns to know other objects perceived by the senses
as one observes minerals plants animals so can one observe man also
he is related to these three forms of existence
like the minerals he builds his body out of the materials in nature like the plants he grows and his species he perceives the objects around him and like the animals forms on the basis of the impressions they make his inner experiences
one may therefore ascribe to man a mineral a plant and an animal existence
the difference in the structure of minerals plants and animals corresponds with these three forms of existence
and it is this structure this shape which one perceives through the senses and which alone one can call body
but the human body is different from that of the animal
this difference everybody must recognize whatever may be his opinion in other respects regarding the relationship of man to animals
even the most radical who denies all soul will not be able to avoid agreeing with the following sentence which in his der and des
the finer inner construction of the nervous system and especially of the brain remains as yet an unsolved problem to the and the but that this concentration of the structure increases more and more in the animal and in man reaches a stage unequaled in any other being is a fully established fact a fact which is of the deepest significance in regard to the spiritual evolution of man of which indeed we may frankly say it is a sufficient explanation
where therefore the structure of the brain has not developed properly where its smallness and poverty show themselves as in the case of and it goes without saying that one can as little expect the appearance of original ideas and of knowledge as one can expect propagation of species in persons with completely organs of generation
on the other hand a strong and beautiful construction of the whole person especially of the brain will certainly not in itself take the place of genius but it will at any rate supply the first and indispensable requirement for higher knowledge
just as one ascribes to the human body the three forms of existence mineral plant animal one must now ascribe to it yet a fourth the distinctively human form
through his mineral form of existence man is related to everything visible through his form of existence to all beings that grow and propagate their species through his animal existence to all those that perceive their surroundings and by means of external impressions have inner experiences
through his human form of existence he constitutes even in regard to his body alone a kingdom by himself
the soul being of man differs from his through being his own inner world
this inner world peculiar to each person faces one the moment one directs ones attention to the simplest sensation
one finds in the first place that no one can know if another person perceives even the simplest sensation in exactly the same way as one does oneself
it is known that there are people who are
they see things only in different shades of gray
others are partially
they are unable because of this to perceive certain shades of colors
the picture of the world which their eyes give them is different from that of normal persons
and the same holds good in regard to the other senses
it will be seen therefore without further elaboration that even simple sensations belong to the inner world
i can perceive with my bodily senses the red table which another person also perceives but i can not perceive his sensation of red
one must therefore describe sensation as belonging to the soul
if one this fact alone quite clearly he will soon cease to regard inner experiences as mere brain processes or something similar
the first result of sensation is feeling
one sensation causes man pleasure another displeasure
these are stirrings of his inner his soul life
man creates in his feelings a second world in addition to that which works on him from without
and a third is added to will
through it man reacts on the outer world
and he thereby stamps the impress of his inner being on the outer world
the soul of man as it were flows outward in the activities of his will
the actions of the human being differ from the occurrences of outer nature in that they bear the impress of his inner life
in this way the soul represents what is mans own in contradistinction to the outer world
he receives from the outer world the incitements but he creates in responding to these incitements a world of his own
the becomes the foundation of the soul being of man
the soul being of man is not determined by the body alone
man does not wander aimlessly and without a goal from one sensation to another neither does he act under the influence of every casual incitement directed on him either from without or through the processes of his body
he thinks about his perceptions and his acts
by thinking about his perceptions he gains knowledge of things by thinking about his acts he introduces a reasonable coherence into his life
he knows also that he will fulfill his duty as a human being only when he lets himself be guided by correct thinking in knowledge as well as in acts
the soul of man therefore faces a twofold necessity
the laws of the body govern it in accordance with the necessities of nature but it allows itself to be governed by the laws which guide it to exact thinking because it voluntarily acknowledges their necessity
nature subjects man to the laws of the change of matter but he subjects himself to the laws of thought
by this means he makes himself a member of a higher order than that to which he belongs through his body
and this order is the spiritual
the soul is as different from the body as the body is different from the soul
so long as one speaks only of the particles of carbon hydrogen nitrogen and oxygen which stir in the body one has not the soul in view
the soul life begins only when within the motion of these particles sensation arises and one can say i taste sweetness or i feel pleasure
just as little has one the spiritual in view when one considers merely the soul experiences which course through a man who gives himself over entirely to the outer world and his bodily life
rather is this soul life merely the basis for the spiritual just as the body is the basis of the soul life
the naturalist or investigator of nature has to do with the body the investigator of the soul the psychologist with the soul and the investigator of the spirit with the spirit
to realize what one is in oneself and thus become clear as to the difference between body soul and spirit is a requirement which must be demanded from those who wish by thinking to enlighten themselves regarding the constitution of man
man can enlighten himself in a correct way concerning himself only when he the significance of thinking within his being
the brain is the bodily instrument for thinking
just as man can only see colors with a properly constructed eye so the suitably constructed brain serves him for thought
the whole body of man is so formed that it receives its crown in the organ of the spirit the brain
one can understand the construction of the human brain only by observing it in relation to its task which consists in being the instrument or tool for the thinking spirit
this is borne out by a comparative survey of the animal world
among we find the brain small in comparison with the cord in mammals it is proportionately larger in man it is largest in comparison with the rest of the body
there are many prejudices prevalent regarding such statements about thinking as are brought forward here
many persons are inclined to thinking and to place higher the warm life of feeling or emotion
some indeed say it is not by dry thinking but by warmth of feeling by the immediate power of the emotions that one raises oneself to higher knowledge
persons who speak thus fear to blunt the feelings by clear thinking
this certainly results from the ordinary thinking that refers only to matters of utility
but in the case of thoughts that lead to higher regions of existence the opposite is the result
there is no feeling and no enthusiasm to be compared with the sentiments of warmth beauty and exaltation which are through the pure thoughts which refer to the higher worlds
for the highest feelings are as a matter of fact not those which come of themselves but those which are gained by energetic and thinking
the human body has a construction adapted to thinking
the same materials and forces which are present in the mineral kingdom are so combined in the human body that by means of these combinations thought can manifest itself
this mineral construction formed as a suitable instrument for its work will be called in the following pages the physical body of man
in literature it is called
this organized mineral construction with the brain as its center comes into existence by propagation and reaches its developed form through growth
propagation and growth man has in common with plants and animals
propagation and growth distinguish what is living from the lifeless mineral
what lives comes forth from the living by means of the germ
the descendant follows the forefathers in the succession of the living
the forces through which a mineral originates we must look for in the materials themselves which compose it
a quartz crystal is formed by the forces united in it and inherent in the silicon and oxygen
the forces which shape an oak tree we must look for in a roundabout way in the germ in the mother and father plants
the form of the oak is preserved through propagation from forefathers to descendants
there are inner determining forces innate in all that is living
it was a crude view of nature which held that lower animals even fishes could evolve out of mud
the form of the living passes itself on by means of heredity
the manner in which a living being develops depends on what father and mother beings it has sprung from or in other words on the species to which it belongs
the materials of which it is composed change continually the species remains during life and is transmitted to the descendants
thus the species is that which conditions the organizing and molding of the materials
this force will here be called in literature it is called
just as the mineral forces express themselves in crystals so the expresses itself in the species or form of plant and animal life
the mineral forces are perceived by man by means of the bodily senses
and he can only perceive that for which he has such senses
without the eye there is no perception of light without the ear no perception of sound
the lowest order of organic beings has only a kind of sense of touch
for these there exist only those mineral forces of which the sense of touch enables them to become aware
in proportion as the other senses are developed in the higher animals is the surrounding world richer and more varied for them
it depends therefore on the organs of a being whether that which exists in the outer world exists also for the being itself as perception as sensation
what is present in the air as a certain motion becomes in man the sensation of hearing
man does not perceive the manifestations of the through the ordinary senses
he sees the colors of the plants he smells their perfume the remains hidden from this form of observation
but the ordinary senses have just as little right to deny the existence of the as has the man born blind to deny that colors exist
colors are there for the person born blind just as soon as he has been operated upon in the same way the as creating the various species of plants and animals created by it is present to man as an object of perception as soon as the necessary organ unfolds within him
an entirely new world opens out to man through the unfolding of this organ
he now perceives not merely the colors the odors
of the beings but these beings themselves
in each plant in each animal he perceives besides the physical form the
in order to have a name for this let it be called the or
to the investigator of spiritual life this matter presents itself in the following manner the is for him not merely a product of the materials and forces of the physical body but a real independent entity which first calls forth these physical materials and forces into life
one speaks in harmony with spiritual science when one says a mere physical body a crystal for example has its form by means of the physical formative forces dwelling within it
a living body does not have its form by means of these forces for in the moment in which life is extinct in it and it is given over to the physical forces only it falls to pieces
the is an organism which preserves the physical body every moment during life from dissolution
in order to see this body to perceive it in another being one requires the awakened spiritual eye
without this one can accept its existence as a fact on logical grounds but one can see it with the spiritual eye as one sees a color with the physical eye
one should not take offense at the expression
ether here designates something different from the hypothetical ether of the physicist
one should regard the thing simply as a name for what is described here
and just as the physical body of man is constructed in conformity with its set task so is it also in conformity with the of man
one can understand it also only when one observes it in relation to the thinking spirit
the of man differs from that of plants and animals through being organized so as to serve the requirements of the thinking spirit
just as man belongs to the mineral world through his physical body he belongs through his to the
after death the physical body into the mineral world the into the
in literature the human is called
by the word body is designated what in any way gives a being shape or form
the word used in this sense must not be confused with the word body when used to designate physically sensible bodies
used in this sense the term body can also be applied to forms which soul and spirit may assume
in the we still have something external to man
with the first stirrings of sensation the inner self responds to the of the outer world
you may trace what one is justified in calling the outer world ever so far but you will not be able to find the sensation
rays of light stream into the eye penetrating till they reach the retina
there they call forth chemical processes in the the effect of this stimulus is passed on through the nerve to the brain there further physical processes arise
could one observe these one would see more physical processes just as elsewhere in the physical world
if i am able to observe the i will see how the process is at the same time a
but the sensation of blue color which the recipient of the rays of light has i can find nowhere in this manner
it arises only within the soul of the recipient
if therefore the being of the recipient consisted only of the physical body and the sensation could not exist
the activity by which sensation becomes a fact differs essentially from the operations of the
by that activity an inner experience is called forth from these operations
without this activity there would be a mere such as one observes in plants
if one tries to picture how a human being receives impacts from all sides one must think of him at the same time as the source of the activity which streams out toward every point from which he received these impacts
sensations respond in all directions to the impacts
this fountain of activity is to be called the
it is the same as that which in literature is called
this is just as real as the physical body
if a man stand before me and i disregard his by thinking of him as merely a physical body it is exactly as if i were to call up in my mind instead of a the canvas
a similar statement has to be made in regard to perceiving the as was previously made in reference to the
the bodily organs are blind to it
and blind to it is also the organ by which life as life can be perceived
but just as the is seen by means of this organ the inner world of sensation itself can be seen through a still higher organ
a man then not only senses the impressions of the physical and life worlds but he beholds the sensations themselves
before a man with such an organ the world of the sensations of another being is spread out like an open and for him a book
one must distinguish between experiencing ones own sensation world and looking at the sensation world of another
every man of course can see into his own sensation world only the with the opened spiritual eye can see the sensation world of another
unless a man be a he knows the sensation world only as an inner one only as the peculiar hidden experiences of his own soul with the opened spiritual eye there shines out before the external spiritual gaze what otherwise lives only in the inner being of another
the depends as regards its activity on the because it draws from it that which it will cause to gleam forth as sensation
and since the is the life within the physical body the is indirectly dependent on the latter
only with and eyes are correct color sensations possible
it is in this way that the affects the
the latter is thus determined and limited in its by the body
it lives therefore within the limitations fixed for it by the
the body accordingly is built up of mineral materials is by the and itself limits the
he therefore who has the organ for seeing the sees it limited by the body
but the limits of the do not coincide with those of the physical body
the soul extends somewhat beyond it
by this one sees that it proves itself more powerful than the physical body
but the force through which its limits are set proceeds from the physical body
so that between the physical body and the on the one the on the other there inserts itself another distinct member of the human constitution
this is the or sentient body
it is called in literature astral shape or signifies form or shape
one can also say a part of the is finer than the rest and this finer part of the forms a unity with the whereas the part forms a kind of unity with the physical body
nevertheless the extends as has been said beyond the
what is here called sensation is only a part of the soul being
the expression is chosen for the sake of simplicity
connected with sensations are the feelings of desire and aversion impulses instincts passions
all this bears the same character of individualized life as do the sensations and is like them dependent on the
just as the enters into mutual action and reaction with the body so does it also with thinking with the spirit
thought among other things is of immediate service to it
man forms thoughts about his sensations
in this way he himself regarding the outside world
the child that has burnt itself thinks it over and reaches the thought fire burns
also man does not follow blindly his impulses instincts passions his thought over them brings about the opportunity by which he can gratify them
what one calls material civilization moves entirely in this direction
it consists in the services which thinking renders to the
quantities of are directed to this end
it is that has built ships railways telephones and by far the greatest proportion of all this serves only to satisfy the needs of the
permeates the in a similar way to that in which the permeates the physical body
connects the physical body with forefathers and descendants and thus brings it under a system of laws with which the purely mineral body is in no way concerned
in the same way brings the soul under a system of laws to which it does not belong as mere
through the man is related to the animals
in animals also we observe the presence of sensations impulses instincts and passions
but the animal obeys these immediately
they do not in its case become interwoven with independent thoughts transcending the immediate experiences
this is also the case to a certain extent with undeveloped human beings
the mere is therefore different from the evolved higher member of the soul which brings thinking into its service
this soul that is served by thought will be designated the
one could call it also the emotional
literature calls it
the permeates the
he who has the organ for seeing the soul sees therefore the as a separate entity distinct from the mere
by thinking man is raised above and beyond his own personal life
he acquires something that extends beyond his soul
he comes to take for granted his conviction that the laws of thought are in conformity with the laws of the world
and he feels at home in the world because this conformity exists
this conformity is one of the important facts through which man learns to know his own nature
man searches in his soul for truth and through this truth it is not only the soul that speaks but the things of the world
that which is recognized as truth by means of thought has an independent significance which refers to the things of the world and not merely to ones own soul
my delight in the heavens is part of my own inner being the thoughts which i form for myself about the courses of the heavenly bodies have the same significance for the thinking of every other person as they have for mine
it would be absurd to speak of my delight were i not in existence but it is not in the same way absurd to speak of my thoughts even without reference to myself
for the truth which i think today was true yesterday also and will be true tomorrow although i concern myself with it only today
if a piece of knowledge gives me joy the joy has significance just so long as it lives in me
the truth of the knowledge has its significance quite independently of the joy
by grasping the truth the soul connects itself with something that carries its worth in itself
and this worth does not vanish with the feeling in the soul any more than it arose with it
what is really truth neither arises nor passes away it has a significance which can not be destroyed
this is not contradicted by the fact that certain human truths have a value which is inasmuch as they are recognized after a certain period as partial or complete errors
for man must say to himself that truth after all exists in itself although his conceptions are only transient forms of manifestation of the eternal truth
even he who says like that he contents himself with the eternal striving toward truth because the full pure truth can after all only exist for a god does not deny the eternity of truth but establishes it by such an utterance
for only that which has an eternal significance in itself can call forth an eternal striving after it
were truth not in itself independent if it acquired its worth and significance through the feelings of the human soul then it could not be the one common goal for all mankind
one concedes its independent being by the very fact that one wishes to strive after it
and as it is with the truth so it is with the truly good
the moral good is independent of inclinations and passions inasmuch as it does not allow itself to be commanded by them but commands them
likes and dislikes desire and loathing belong to the personal soul of man
duty stands higher than likes and dislikes
duty may stand so high in the eyes of a man that he will sacrifice his life for its sake
and a man stands the higher the more he has his inclinations his likes and dislikes so that without compulsion or they themselves obey the recognized duty
the moral good has like truth its eternal value in itself and does not receive it from the
in causing the true and good to come to life in his inner being man raises himself above the mere
the eternal spirit shines into this soul
a light is kindled in it which is imperishable
in so far as the soul lives in this light it is a participant of the eternal
it unites its own existence with an eternal existence
what the soul carries within itself of the true and the good is immortal in it
that which shines forth in the soul as eternal is to be called here
consciousness can be spoken of even in connection with the lower soul stirrings
the most ordinary everyday sensation is a matter of consciousness
to this extent animals also have consciousness
the kernel of human consciousness that is the soul within the soul is here meant by
the is accordingly differentiated from the as yet another distinct member of the human soul
the is still in the sensations the impulses the passions
everyone knows how at first a man holds that to be true which he owing to his feelings prefers
only that truth however is permanent which has freed itself from all taint of such feelings as sympathy and antipathy
the truth is true even if all personal feelings revolt against it
the part of the soul in which this truth lives will be called
so that even as one had to distinguish three members in the body one has also to distinguish three in the soul
and just as the works from below upward with a limiting effect on the soul so the spiritual works from above downward into it expanding it
for the more the soul fills itself with the true and the good the wider and the more comprehensive becomes the eternal in it
to him who is able to see the soul the splendor which goes out from a human being because his eternal is expanding is just as much a reality as the light which streams out from a flame is real to the physical eye
for the the corporeal man is only a part of the whole man
the body as the structure lies within others which interpenetrate both it and each other
the fills the physical body as a double form extending beyond this on all sides is to be seen the astral shape
and beyond this again extends the then the which grows the larger the more it receives into itself of the true and the good
for this true and good cause the expansion of the
a man living only and entirely according to his inclinations his likes and dislikes would have an whose limits coincide with those of his
these organizations in the midst of which the physical body appears as if in a cloud are called the human aura
in the course of the childhood of a human being there comes a moment in which for the first time he feels himself to be an independent being distinct from the whole of the rest of the world
for persons with natures it is a significant experience
the poet says in his autobiography i shall never forget the event which took place within me hitherto narrated to no one and of which i can give place and time when i stood present at the birth of my
as a very small child i stood at the door of the house one morning looking toward the wood pile on my left when suddenly the inner revelation i am an i came to me like a flash of lightning from heaven and has remained shining ever since
in that moment my ego had seen itself for the first time and forever
any deception of memory is hardly to be conceived as possible here for no by outsiders could have introduced additions to an occurrence which took place in the holy of of a human being and of which the novelty alone gave permanence to such everyday surroundings
it is known that little children say to themselves is good wishes to have this
they speak of themselves as if of others because they have not yet become conscious of their independent existence because the consciousness of the self is not yet born in them
through man describes himself as an independent being separate from all others as i in his i man brings together all that he experiences as a being in body and soul
body and soul are the carriers of the ego or i in them it acts
just as the physical body has its center in the brain so has the soul its center in the ego
man is aroused to sensations by impacts from without feelings manifest themselves as the effects of the outer world the will relates itself to the outside world in that it realizes itself in external actions
the ego as the peculiar and essential being of man remains quite invisible
excellently therefore does call a mans recognition of his ego an occurrence taking place only in the veiled holy of of a man for with his i man is quite alone
and this i is the man himself
that him in regarding his ego as his true being
he may therefore describe his body and his soul as the or veils within which he lives and he may describe them as his tools through which he acts
in the course of his evolution he learns to regard these tools ever more and more as the servants of his ego
the little word i as it is used for example in the and languages is a name which differs from all other names
anyone who reflects in an appropriate manner on the nature of this name will find that it forms an avenue to the understanding of the human being in the deeper sense
any other name can be applied to its corresponding object by all men in the same way
anybody can call a table table or a chair chair but this is not so with the name i no one can use it in referring to another person each one can call only himself i never can the name i reach my ears from outside when it refers to me
only from within only through itself can the soul refer to itself as i when the human being therefore says i to himself something begins to speak in him that has nothing to do with anyone of the worlds from which the so far mentioned are taken
the i becomes ever more and more ruler of body and soul
this also comes to visible expression in the aura
the more the i is lord over body and soul the more numerous and complex are its members and the more varied and rich are the colors of the aura
this effect of the i on the aura can be seen by the seeing person
the i itself is invisible even to him
this remains truly within the veiled holy of of a man
but the i absorbs into itself the rays of the light which flames forth in a man as eternal light
as he gathers together the experiences of body and soul in the i he also causes the thoughts of truth and goodness to stream into the i the phenomena of the senses reveal themselves to the i from the one side the spirit reveals itself from the other
body and soul yield themselves up to the i in order to serve it but the i yields itself up to the spirit in order that it may be filled by it
the i lives in body and soul but the spirit lives in the i and what there is of spirit in the i is eternal
for the i receives its nature and significance from that with which it is bound up
inasmuch as it lives in the physical body it is subject to the laws of the mineral world through its to the laws of propagation and growth by virtue of the sentient and intellectual souls to the laws of the soul world in so far as it receives the spiritual into itself it is subject to the laws of the spirit
that which the mineral laws and the life laws construct comes into being and vanishes but the spirit has nothing to do with becoming and perishing
the i lives in the soul
although the highest manifestation of the i belongs to the one must nevertheless say that this i out from it fills the whole of the soul and through the soul affects the body
and in the i the spirit is alive
it rays into it and lives in it as in a sheath or veil just as the i lives in its the body and the soul
the spirit develops the i from within outward the mineral world develops it from without inward
the spirit forming an i and living as i will be called because it as the i or ego or self of man
signifies the same as that which in literature is called higher
the word is related to the word man and the word and signifies the human being in so far as he is a spiritual being
the difference between the and the can be made clear in the following way
the is the bearer of the truth which is independent of all antipathy and sympathy the bears within it the same truth but taken up into and enclosed by the i individualized by the latter and absorbed into the independent being of the man
it is through the eternal truth becoming thus individualized and bound up into one being with the i that the i itself attains to eternity
the is a revelation of the spiritual world within the i just as from the other side sensations are a revelation of the physical world within the i in that which is red green light dark hard soft warm cold one recognizes the revelations of the corporal world in what is true and good the revelations of the spiritual world
in the same sense in which the revelation of the corporal world is called sensation let the revelation of the spiritual be called intuition
even the most simple thought contains intuition for one can not touch it with the hands or see it with the eyes one must receive its revelation from the spirit through the i if an undeveloped and a developed man look at a plant there lives in the i of the one something quite different from that which is in the ego of the other
and yet the sensations of both are called forth by the same object
the difference lies in this that the one can make far more perfect thoughts about the object than the other can
if objects revealed themselves through sensation alone there could be no progress in spiritual development
even the savage is affected by nature but the laws of nature reveal themselves only to the thoughts by intuition of the more highly developed man
the from the outer world are felt even by the child as incentives to the will but the of the morally good disclose themselves to him in the course of his development only as he learns to live in the spirit and understand its revelations
just as there could be no color sensations without physical eyes there could be no intuitions without the higher thinking of the
and as little as sensation creates the plant on which the color appears does intuition create the spiritual realities about which it is merely giving information
the i of man which comes to life in the soul draws in messages from above from the spirit world through intuitions just as through sensations it draws in messages from the physical world
by doing this it makes the spirit world the individualized life of its own soul even as it does the physical world by means of the senses
the soul or the i flaming forth in it opens its on two sides toward the corporal and toward the spiritual
now as just the physical world can only give information about itself to the ego because it builds out of physical materials and forces a body in which the conscious soul can live and possess organs for perceiving the corporal world outside itself so the spiritual world builds with its spiritual materials and spiritual forces a in which the i can live and through intuitions perceive the spiritual
it is evident that the expression contains a contradiction according to the literal meaning of the word
it is only to be used in order to direct attention to what in the spiritual regions corresponds to the body of man in the physical
just as within the physical world each human body is built up as a separate being so is the within the spirit world
in the spirit world there is for man an inner and an outer just as there is in the physical world
as man takes in the materials of the physical world around him and them within his physical body so does he take the spiritual from the spiritual environment and make it into his own
the spiritual is the eternal nourishment of man
and as man is born of the physical world he is also born of the spirit through the eternal laws of the true and the good
he is separated from the spirit world outside of him as he is separated from the whole physical world as an independent being
this independent spiritual being will be called
it is the same as that which is called in literature
if we examine the human physical body we find the same materials and forces in it as we find outside it in the rest of the physical world
it is the same with the
in it the elements of the external spirit world
in it the forces of the rest of the spirit world are active
as a being within the physical skin becomes a entity living and feeling so also in the spirit world
the spiritual skin which separates the spirit man from the uniform spirit world makes him an independent being within it living a life within himself and perceiving intuitively the spiritual content of the world
this spiritual skin will be called
in literature it is called sheath
it must be kept clearly in mind that the spiritual skin expands continually with the advancing human evolution so that the spiritual individuality of man his sheath is capable of enlargement to an unlimited extent
the lives within this
it is built up by the spiritual in the same way as is the physical body by the physical
in a similar way to that in which one speaks of an one must therefore speak of an in reference to the
let this be called
the spiritual being of man therefore is composed of three parts and
are the corresponding expressions in literature
for is the separated special which is formed by the spiritual or
for him who is a in the spiritual regions this spiritual being of man is a perceptible reality as the higher truly spiritual part of the aura
he sees the as within the and he sees how this grows continually larger by taking in spiritual nourishment from the spiritual external world
further he sees how the continually increases widens out through what is brought into it and how the becomes ever larger and larger
for the difference between the spiritual and the physical being of man is that the latter has a limited size while the former can grow to an unlimited extent
whatever of spiritual nourishment is absorbed has an eternal worth
the human aura is accordingly composed of two parts
color and form are given to the one by the physical existence of man and to the other by his spiritual existence
the ego forms the separation between them in this way that while the physical after its own manner gives itself to building up a body which allows a soul to live and expand in it and the ego gives itself to allowing to live and develop in it the spirit which now for its part permeates the soul and gives it the goal in the spirit world
through the body the soul is enclosed in the physical through the there grow wings for its moving in the spiritual world
in order to comprehend the whole man one must think of him as formed of the components above mentioned
the body builds itself up out of the world of physical matter in such a way that the construction is adapted to the requirements of the thinking ego
it is penetrated with and thereby becomes the ether or
as such it opens itself through the sense organs toward the outer world and becomes the
this the permeates and becomes one with
the does not merely receive the impacts of the outer world as sensations
it has its own inner life which it through thinking on the one hand as it does through sensations on the other
in this way it becomes the
it is able to do this by opening itself up to intuitions from above as it does to sensations from below
thus it becomes the
this is possible to it because the spirit world builds into it the organ of intuition just as the physical body builds in it the sense organs
as the senses transmit sensations by means of the the spirit transmits to it intuitions through the organ of intuition
the is therefore linked into a unity with the just as the physical body is with the in the
and form a unity
in this unity the lives as just as the ether body forms the bodily for the
and as the physical body is enclosed in the physical skin so is the in the
the members of the whole man are as follows the i flashes forth in the soul receives the infusion from out the spirit and thereby becomes the bearer of the
through this man participates in the three worlds the physical the soul and the spiritual
he takes root in the physical world through his physical body and and flowers through the and up into the spiritual world
the however which takes root in the one and flowers in the other is the soul itself
one can express this arrangement of the members of man in a simplified way but one entirely consistent with the above
although the human i flashes forth in the it nevertheless the whole
the parts of this are not as distinctly separate as are the limbs of the body they penetrate each other in a higher sense
if then one hold clearly in view the and the as the two members united to form the bearer of the i and this i as their kernel one can divide man into physical body and i the expression designates here what is formed by and together although the is in a certain respect energized by the i when now the i itself with this comes into evidence in the transmutation of the by a force within the soul
in the there are primarily active the impulses desires and passions of man in so far as they are felt by him the physical perceptions also take effect in it
physical perceptions arise through the as a member in man which comes to him from the external world
impulses desires and passions
arise in the in so far as it is energized by the soul before the latter has yielded itself to the spirit
if the i itself with the soul proceeds to the with this
this expresses itself in the illumination of the impulses desires and passions by what the i has received from the spirit
the i has then through the power it gains as partaker of the spiritual world become ruler in the world of impulses desires
in proportion to the extent to which it has become this the appears in the
and the becomes thereby transmuted
the itself then becomes visible as a body an and a transmuted
one can therefore designate the as manifested in man as transmuted
a similar process takes place in a person when he receives the life spirit into his i the then becomes transmuted
it becomes penetrated with the
and the reveals itself in that the becomes quite other than it was
for this reason one can also say that is transmuted
and if the i receives the it thereby receives the strong force with which to penetrate the physical body
naturally that part of the physical body thus transmuted is not perceptible to the physical senses
it is in fact just that part of the physical body which has been that has become the
the physical body is then present to the physical senses as physical and in so far as this physical is it has to be perceived by spiritual faculties of perception
to the external senses the physical even when penetrated by the spiritual appears to be merely sensible
their peculiar perfume is the chief association with spices so sorcery is allied in every memory to gypsies
and as it has not escaped many poets that there is something more strangely sweet and mysterious in the scent of cloves than in that of flowers so the attribute of inherited magic power adds to the romance of these picturesque wanderers
both the spices and the come from the far of divination and enchantment
the latter have been traced with tolerable accuracy if we admit their affinity with the and back to the threshold of history or into prehistoric times and in all ages they or their women have been engaged as if by instinct in selling enchant
merits prophecies and and dealing with the devil generally ill a small retail way
as it was of old so it is today it is no great problem ill or anthropology as to how gypsies became
we may find a very curious illustration of it in the
this is apparently as humble modest prosaic little fowl as exists and as far from mystery and wickedness as an old hen
but the of the olden time and the and the gypsies who lurked and lived in the forest knew better
they saw how this strange little creature in her way slipped in and out of hollow trees and wood shade into sunlight and was gone no man knew and so they knew that it was an uncanny creature and told wonderful tales of its deeds in human form and today it is called by gypsies in as in the or more briefly the witch
just so the gypsies themselves with their glittering eyes slipping like the in and out of the shadow of the unknown and away and invisible won for themselves the name which now they wear
wherever or the sorcery which is based on or commanding spirits exists its professors from leading strange lives or from solitude or wandering become strange and
when men have this appearance people associate with it mysterious power
this is the case in among the or red with all of whom the voodoo or has the eye of the glittering and cold as that of a serpent
so the gypsies from the mere fact of being wanderers and livers in wild places became and when asked if they did not associate with the devils who dwell in the desert places admitted the soft and being further questioned as to whether their friends the devils fairies and had not taught them how to tell the future they pleaded guilty and finding that it paid well went to work in their small way to improve their science and particularly their resources
it was an easy calling it required no property or properties neither capital nor capitol nor shrines wherein to work the oracle
and as i believe that a company of children left entirely to themselves would form and grow up with a language which in a very few years would be spoken fluently so i am certain that the shades of night and fear pain and lightning and mystery would produce in the same time conceptions of dreaded beings resulting first in and then in the fancied art of driving devils away
for out of my own childish experiences and memories i retain with absolute accuracy material enough to declare that without any aid from other people the youthful mind forms for itself strange and seemingly supernatural phenomena
a tree or bush waving in the night breeze by moonlight is perhaps mistaken for a great man the mere repetition of the sight or of its memory make it a personal reality
once when i was a child powerful doses of caused a peculiar in my ear which i for some time believed was the sound of somebody continually walking upstairs
very young children sometimes imagine invisible playmates or companions talk with them and actually believe that the unseen talk to them in return
i myself knew a small boy who had as he sincerely believed such a companion whom he called bill and when he could not understand his lessons he consulted the mysterious william who explained them to him
there are children who by the voluntary or involuntary exercise of visual perception or reproduce or create images which they imagine to be real and this faculty is much commoner than is supposed
in fact i believe that where it exists in most remarkable degrees the adults to whom the children describe their visions dismiss them as fancies or falsehoods
even in the very extraordinary cases recorded by professor in which little children formed for themselves spontaneously a language in which they fluently neither their parents nor anybody else appears to have taken the least interest in the matter
however the fact being that babes can form for themselves supernatural conceptions and embryo mythologies and as they always do attribute to strange or persons power which the latter do not possess it is easy without going further to understand why a wild gypsy with eyes like a demon when excited and at his calmest should have been supposed to be a by credulous childlike villagers
all of this i believe might have taken place or really did take place in the very dawn of mans existence as a rational as soon as the frontal of the brain which monkeys do not possess had begun with the genial essential to language to develop itself then also certain other and not as yet discovered but which ad interim i will call the began to act
genial they certainly were joy and much sorrow has man got out of his if it and talk are he might as well many a time have been better off if he were dumb
so out of the earliest time in the very two of a misty morning in history man came forth believing in nonexistent and evils as soon as he could talk and talking about them as fast as he formed them
long before the conception of anything good or or of a heavenly father or benevolent angels came to him he was scared with nightmares and spirits of death and darkness hell hunger torture and terror
we all know how difficult it is for many people when some one dies out of a household to get over the involuntary feeling that we shall unexpectedly meet the departed in the usual haunts
in almost every family there is a record how some one has heard a voice they can not hear or the dead speaking in the familiar tones
hence the belief in ghosts as soon as men began to care for death at all or to miss those who had gone
so first of all came and or and from setting out food for the latter
which was the most obvious and childlike manner to please them grew sacrifices to evil spirits and finally the whole system of sacrifice in all its elaboration
it may therefore be concluded that as soon as man began to think and speak and fear the mysterious he also began to appease ghosts and by sacrifices
then there sprung up at as or the man who had the wit to do the sacrificing and eat the meats sacrificed and explain that he had arranged it all privately with the dead and the devils
he knew all about them and he could drive them away
this was the
he seems to have had a origin somewhere in central and to have spread with his magic drum and songs and stinking smoke his all over the face of the earth even as his descendant general booth with his is doing at the present day
but the earliest authentic records of are to be found in the and records
according to it all diseases whatever as well as all disasters were directly the work of evil spirits which were to be driven away by songs of burning of perfumes or drugs and performing ceremonies many of which with scraps of the are found in familiar use here and there at the present day
most important of all in it was the extraordinary influence of the himself on his patient for he made the one acted on sleep or wake freed him from many apparently dire disorders in a minute among others of which were believed to be caused by devils dwelling in nearest and latest explanation of which magic power is given in that very remarkable book or treatment by sleep and suggestion by c md
and co which i commend to all persons interested in as casting light on some of the most interesting and perplexing problems of humanity and especially of magic
it would seem at least among the and red that the first stage of was a very horrible practised chiefly by women in which attempts were made to conciliate the evil spirits the means employed embracing everything which could revolt and startle barbarous men
thus fragments of dead bodies and poison and and crimes formed its basis
i think it very probable that this was the primitive religion among savages everywhere
an immense amount of it in its conceivable forms still exists among as voodoo
after a time this primitive or had its brave and shrewd men who conjectured that the powers of evil might be exploited to advantage
there is great confusion and little knowledge as yet as regards primitive man but till we know better we may roughly assume that was the religion of the people of the period if they could talk at all since language is denied to the men of the and type
all that we can declare with some certainty is that we find the advanced the religion of the early races among whose descendants and other people allied to them it exists to this day
the incident in the history of humanity is the appearance of the man of
he it was who founded what m de calls a magnificent race probably one which speedily developed a high civilization and a refined religion
but the old with its amulets and smoke its noises more or less musical of drums and enchanted bells and its main belief that all the ills of life came from the action of evil spirits was deeply based among the inferior races and the inferior scions of the stock clung to it in forms more or less modified
just as the earlier or the worship and of evil overlapped in many places the newer so the latter overlapped the beautiful of the early the stately of the and the other more advanced or ingenious developments of the idea of a creative cause
there are in fact even among us now minds to whom or even is deeply or adapted by nature and there are hundred of millions who while professing a higher and doctrine cling to its forms or essentials believing that because the apparatus is called by a different name it is in no respect whatever the same thing
finally there are men who with no logical belief whatever in any kind of supernaturalism study it and love it and are moved by it owing to its endless associations with poetry art and all the legends of infancy or youth
was not in his reasoning moments anything more or less than a strict or but all the dreams and fairies and whether of the middle ages or the were inexpressibly dear to him and they move like myriad through the sunshine of his poetry and prose often causing long rays when there were bars at the that on which the saint hung his cloak
it is probable or certain that or that into which it has very naturally developed will influence all mankind until science by absorbing mans love of the in stupendous discoveries shall so put to shame the old or that the latter will seem poor and childish
in all the nights there is nothing more than the new idea that voices and sounds may be laid aside like real books and made to speak and sing again years afterwards
and in all of that vast repertory of lore unveiled there is nothing so wonderful as the simple truth that every child may be educated to possess an infinitely developed memory of words sights sounds and ideas allied to incredible quickness of perception and practice of the constructive faculties
these with the vast fields of adjusting improved social relations and of which in a certain way opens dazzling vistas of a certain kind of enchantment or brilliant go fast and far to change the old romance to a radically different state of feeling and association
it is it come doubtless there was an awful romance of darkness about the old which caused its worshippers to declare that the new lights of could never it
just so many millions of educated people at present can not be brought to understand that all things to which they are used are not based on immutable laws of nature and must needs be eternal
they will find it hard to comprehend that there can ever be any kind of poetry art or sentiment utterly different from that to which they and their ancestors have been accustomed
yet it is clear and plain before them this new era looking them directly in the face about to usher in a reformation compared to which all the and revolutions and new religions which the world has ever seen were as nothing and the children are born who will see more than the beginning of it
in the next chapter i will examine the spells and charms still used among certain gypsies
for be it observed all the gypsy magic and sorcery here described is purely is to say of the most primitive it is the more interesting as having prehistoric times many of the most marked characteristics of the worlds first magic or religion
it treats every disease disorder trouble or affliction as the work of an evil spirit it attempts to banish these influences by the aid of ceremonies many of which by the disgusting and singular nature of the ingredients employed show the lingering influences of the black which preceded and it supernatural agencies such as the spirits of the air and the giant of the forests
in addition to this there will be found to be clearly and unmistakably associated with all their usages symbols and things nearly connected with much which is to be found in and mythology or symbolism
now whether this was drawn from classic sources or whether all came from some ancient and obscure origin can not now be accurately determined
but it certainly can not be denied that folklore of this kind casts a great deal of light on the early history of mankind and the gradual unfolding or evolution of religion and of mind and that if intelligently studied this of the gypsies is as important as any chapter in the grand work
the gypsies came historically speaking very recently from
it has not been so carefully observed as it might that all are not of the religion of much less of or of and that among the lower the with even earlier still holds its own
or voodoo or relies greatly on poisoning for its magic and the first gypsies were said to poison
even to this day there is but one word with them as with many for both medicine and est drab
how exactly this form of and exists today in appears from the following extract from the st in the or thrives and no wonder for is not the community or every village graveyard has its special or and the is the earthly between their and the common folk
the is usually the spiritual adviser to the population of a village and is known as a or priest that is to say he professes to hold commune with the spirits of defunct which have qualified for their unique position in the other their in this one perhaps
every has a guardian that requires and the is the medium
amongst the and other caste is regulated by carnal and a man is distinguished amongst them by a regulated monetary scale
one person may be a caste man while another may only be a caste man
does the caste man wish to the caste man then he the who will in consideration of a certain contribution promote him to a grade
a moneyed man having qualms about his future state should join the where at least he would have an opportunity of utilizing his spare cash for the good of his soul
the average will be only too glad to procure him everlasting glory for a matter of a few rupees
the then serves as regulator of the system
but it is our intention to exhibit him in his peculiar position of to the people
this will perhaps be best explained by an account of the case of one
was a and had been offended by a brother
it appears had stolen one night during his temporary absence at a
on his return finding his gone raised the and the village policeman traced the robbery to hut
yet in spite of this damning proof the village or bench of magistrates decided that as could not swear to the exact of his lost was could not possibly be his
anyhow kept in view and hit upon a plan to do him a grievous bodily injury
scraping together a few rupees he went to the village and promised that worthy a reward if he would only exorcise the and get them to make liver bad
the in consideration of five rupees cash promised compliance
so that night we find the busy with sandalwood and pigs blood the
needless to say that had in a very short space of time all the symptoms of liver complaint
whether the gave a bad liver or the gave him a few doses of poison is a question
anyhow soon died
another case in point is that of
was a retired courtesan who had long plied a profitable trade in the city
we find her however at her native village of the wife of one
soon got tired of his and longed for the contents of her strong box wherein she kept her rupees and other
this was a rather awkward matter for for was still in the prime of life
accordingly visits the and wants liver made bad
nothing easier says the five rupees
has reckoned without his host however for the as general spiritual adviser to the community visits and tells her of little scheme
naturally liver is soon in a decline for ten rupees were put in the opposite side of the scales
of the genus flourish in and when their disposition is vicious the damage they can do is appalling
that these priests exist and do such things as i have illustrated is beyond question
ask any native of his views on the question and he will tell you that there are such things and further that the is the only one able to lay them so to speak
according to the the is a creature which requires constant supplies of liquor and pork otherwise it will wreak its vengeance on the forgetful who neglects the supply
a strange idea too is this of pork being pleasing to the but when it is remembered that the and other are inordinately fond of that meat themselves they are right in supposing pig to be the dish of the who after all are but the departed spirits of their own people
naturally brother or sister gypsy pen the and courtesan of village who in this life liked nothing better than a piece of bacon and a dram of spirits will in their state of after those things still
acting on these notions of the people the lives and thrives exceedingly
yet of all this there is nothing nothing of the
it is all poisoning and and it is exactly like in or any other city in
it is the old faith which came before all which existed through and under and and which as is well known has cropped out again and flourishes vigorously under toleration
and this is the faith which forms the basis of gypsy sorcery as it did of yore that of the and which still survive in the of the
every gypsy who came to a few centuries ago set up as a and did his after the same antique fashion
even today it is much the same but with far less crime
but the or spirit is under other names still believed in still doctored by gypsies with herbs and smoke and be like an rat and conjured into holes bored in trees and away into running streams and naively implored to go where he is wanted to where he was and to no longer bother honest folk who are tired of him
and for all this the confiding villager must pay the gypsy so much it was in the beginning and is now in good faith among millions in who are in a much better class of society
and from this point of view i venture to say that there is not a charm or spell set down in this work or extant which will not be deeply interesting to every sincere student of the history of culture
let me however say in this beginning once for all that i have only given specimens sufficient to illustrate my views for my prescribed limits quite forbid the introduction of all the gypsy cures spells c which i have collected
though not liable to many disorders the gypsies in eastern from their wandering life and camping by marshes and pools where there is malaria suffer a great deal from which in their simple system of medicine are divided into the shilaleie
chills or the or fever and ague
for the former the following remedy is applied three lungs and three livers of frogs are dried and powdered and drunk in spirits after which the sick man or woman says frogs in my belly devour what is bad frogs in my belly show the evil the way out by the evil is understood evil spirits
according to the old belief which was the religion of all mankind every disease is caused by an evil spirit which enters the body and can only be driven out by magic
we have abundant traces of this left in our highest civilization and religion among people who gravely attribute every evil to the devil instead of the unavoidable antagonisms of nature
nothing is more apparent in the new testament than that all diseases were anciently regarded as coming from devils or evil spiritual influences their negative or cure being in some form
this the if they did not learn it from the in the first place had certainly studied deeply in where it formed the great national cult
it was the devil put it into my head says the criminal and there is not a point of this old sorcery which is not earnestly and seriously advocated by the church and the preachers of the salvation army
among the red the idea of evil spirits is carried to logical extremes
if a pen drops from our fingers or a penny rolls from our grasp the former of course falls on our new white dress while the latter nine times out of ten goes directly to the nearest grating or crack or
i that it is literally true if i ever search for a letter or paper it is almost always at the bottom of the rest while and pens seem to be endowed with more than mere instinct or manifest genius in concealing themselves
the having observed this have come to the conclusion that it is all the work of certain busy little mischievous in which i to a certain extent agree with them holding however that the of these is in our own brain
what are our dreams but the action of our other mind or a second me in my brain certainly it is with no will or effort or act of mine that i go through a diabolical nightmare or a dreadful dream whose elaborate and subtle construction betrays very often more ingenuity than i in my waking hours possess
i have had philosophical and literary dreams the outlines of which i have often remembered waking which far transcended anything of the kind which i could ever hope to write
the maker of all this is not i or my will and he is never about or on hand when i am
but in the inadvertent moments of oblivion while writing or while performing any act this other i or is for there may be a multitude of them for i know step in and as they do in dreams
now the distinction between this of subjective demons acting objectively and objective or outside spirits is really too fine to be seen even by a and therefore one need not be amazed that or of the tribe or of new should with these experiences jump at ghosts and gobblers is not to be wondered at still less that they should do something to conciliate or compel these haunting or as they were once bogeys
it is a fact that if ones get into the habit of hiding all we have to do is to deliberately destroy them and get others or at least watch them carefully and they will soon be cured of wandering
on the other hand sacrifices to conciliate and please naturally occur and the more expensive these are the better are they supposed to be
and as human beings were of old the most valuable property they were as naturally supposed to be most acceptable to the gods or by the to god
a west voodoo on being for human sacrifices to the serpent and for eating the bodies replied do you believe that the son of god was sacrificed to save man and do you not eat what your priests say is his very body so difficult is it to draw distinctions between that which is spiritual and the which appear to be such the scapegoat or sufferer who is that many may in other words the unfortunate a natural result of sacrifice
there is a curious trace of it in gypsy
on they make a wooden box or receptacle which is called the pronounced like the gypsy word and meaning the same that sending a thing sent or gift
in this at the bottom are two sticks across as in a cradle and on these are laid herbs and other fetish stuff which every one touches with the finger then the whole is in a winding of white and red wool and carried by the oldest person of the tribe from tent to tent after which it is borne to the next running stream and left there after every one has spat upon it
by doing this they think that all the diseases and disorders which would have them during the coming year are conjured into the box
but woe to him who shall find the box and open it instead of throwing it at once into the stream all the diseases by the gypsy band will fall upon him and his in full measure
it would be an interesting question to know how many good people there are let us say in who if they had all opportunity to work off all their colds tooth head and with the consequent doctors bills or all suffering and expenses on some other family by means of secret sorcery would or would not try it on it is curious to observe the resemblance of the gypsy ceremony
with its box full of mischief and the goat not forgetting the red wool handed down from heathen sacrifice and sorcery of old
in the white wool is the symbol of purification i
the feet of the statues of the gods were in signify that they are slow to avenge if sure
it is altogether an interesting object this gypsy and one would like to know what all the channels were through which the magic ran ere it carne to them
another cure against the fever is to go to a running stream and cast pieces of wood nine times backwards into the running water repeating the rhymes me me may fever go away from me i give it water unto thee unto me thou art not dear therefore go away from here to where they thee where they shelter thee where they love thee this is a very remarkable invocation which takes us into true
or correctly speaking it would be in gypsy means
he is a sylvan has his hold by and wolde as wont to do in forests and lonely rocky places where he lurks to catch beast and men in order to devour them
it is needless to say to those who are aware that the taste of white peoples flesh is like that of very superior chicken and a something much better than that prefers like a simple unsophisticated savage as he is men to animals
like the peasant who remarked its all meat anyhow when he found a mouse in his soup is not particular
he is the guardian of great treasures like most men in the advance business he knows where the money is to be them he is remarkably stupid and can be easily cheated of his
but if anybody does this a service he is very grateful and aids his benefactor either with a loan or with his enormous strength
in many respects he bears a remarkable resemblance to two giants in the mythology especially to spirit of the is equally powerful and stupid and to the who is a giant and yet grateful to friends and also to several gods
the gypsies have here evidently fused several oriental beings into one
this is a process which occurs in the decline of mythologies as in languages
in the infancy of a speech as in its old age many words expressing different ideas but which sound somewhat alike become a single term
in gypsy i have found as many as eight or ten words thus concentrated into one
another cure for a fever
the sufferer goes in the forest and finds a young tree
when the first rays of the rising sun fall on it the patient shakes it with all his might and exclaims fever fever go away here thou stay
here thou stay it is here plain that the shaking the sapling is intended to transfer the shakes as the chill and shuddering of the fever is called in to the tree
then the fever passes into the tree
perhaps it was in this way that the aspen learned to tremble
but among the gypsies in the south of among whom the vaccination or inoculation of trees is greatly the fashion a hole is bored into the wood into which the patient thrice repeats the spell and then stops the hole with a plug
the boring of holes in trees or transferring illness to them is also practised without formulas of speech
thus if while a man is lying down or sitting in the spring he hears the song of the he believes that he will be ill all the time for a year to come especially with unless he goes
nine times to a tree bores a hole in it and into it three times
then he is safe
in mythology the is a bird which brings bad luck and the inhabitants of were so persuaded of this that they introduced a prayer against it into their church service whence they got the name of wolf myth
i p
it announces to men the infidelity of wives and tells listeners how many years they have to live
it is possible that this is a relic of an old form of sacrifice or proof that the idea occurs to all men of thus making a of a tree
the occasional discovery of stone in very old trees in renders this probable
and where the wood grows up and encloses the object it would very rarely happen that it would ever be discovered
it should be added to the previous instance that when they have closed the hole the gypsies eat some of the bark of the next tree
another cure for fever is effected by going in the morning before sunrise to the bank of a stream and digging a hole with some instance a has never been used
into this hole the patient makes water then fills up the hole saying n n pi fever stay here do not come to me dry up in dust come unto me when no water is here
dr translates this last line when there is no more water in the river which is certainly what is meant
while water runs or grass grows c is a formula common to countries
another cure for fever is this the patient must take a an egg and a handful of salt and before sunrise go with them to a throw them away backwards and repeat
when these things again i see fever then return to me
or literally when these things to me come
for the next three days the invalid must not touch money eggs or salt
there is an old ms collection of charms and ceremonies professedly of black in which we are told that if a girl will walk by the light of the full moon round a field or a house and cast behind her at every step a handful of salt she will get the lover whom she desires
salt says was sacred to the deities and it was a symbol of the soul or of life because it preserved the body while in it leg
ant

p
the devil never eats salt
once there was in a peasant who had a witch for a wife and the devil invited them to supper
but all the dishes were without any seasoning and the peasant despite all and hints to hold his tongue kept crying for salt
and when it was brought and he said thank god here is salt at last the whole or ghastly scene vanished
 p
for a great deal of further information and symbolism on and of salt including all the views of the ancient and modern on the subject of lots wife the reader may consult und der by j b salt is put into and charms to ensure the duration of an attachment in some eastern countries it is carried in a little bag as an amulet to preserve health
another cure for fever
the patient must drink from a new jug water from three and after every drink throw into the running stream a handful of salt
then he must make water into the first and say here is thy head at the second he repeats the sacred ceremony and per here is thy belly and again at the third he exclaims and here are thy feet
go now into the water but while passing from one stream to another he must not look back once for then he might behold the dread demon of the fever which follows him neither must he open his mouth except while uttering the charm for then the fever would at once enter his body again through the portal thus left
this walking on in apprehension of the ugly spectre will recall to the reader a passage in the ancient mariner of the man who walks in fear and dread nor turns around his head for well he knows a frightful fiend close behind him tread
the wise wives among the gypsies in have many kinds of miraculous salves for sale to cure different disorders
these they declare are made from the fat of dogs bears wolves frogs and the like
as in all fetish remedies they are said to be of strange or revolting materials like those used by of yore the witches of and and of burns in
when a man has been struck by a spirit there results a sore swelling or boil which is cured by a as follows the patient is put into a tent by himself and is given divers drinks by his attendant then she the sufferer with a salve the secret of which is known only to her while she chants to the evil one stay there
may thirty snakes devour thee thirty dogs tear thee thirty swallow thee after this she a black hen splits it open and lays it on the boil
then the sufferer must drink water from three springs or rivulets and throw wood nine times into the fire daily until he is well
but black hens cost money according to albeit the gypsies like the children of the mist in are believed to be acquainted with a far more economical and direct method of obtaining such commodities
therefore this expensive and cure is not often resorted to and when it is the generally substitutes something cheaper than poultry
it may be here observed that the black hen occurs frequently in and legend as a wolf
 thus the bones of turn into black hens and chickens and it is well if your black hen dies for if she had not you would have perished in her place
black hens were walled up in castles as sacrifices to the devil that the walls might long endure hence the same fowl occurs in the arms of the family of der p
the lore on this subject is very extensive
the following remedy against headache is in general use among gypsies
the patients head is rubbed and then washed with vinegar or hot water while the following charm is repeated oh pain in my head the father of all evil look upon thee now thou hast greatly pained me thou my head remain not in me go thou go thou go home whence thou evil one suck thither thither hasten who upon my shadow to him be the pain it will be seen that the principle of treading on the tail of the coat practised in is much by the gypsies who give a headache to any one who so much as on their shadows
and it is not difficult to understand that as with children the rubbing the head the bathing it with warm water or vinegar and finally the singing a soothing song may all to a cure
the readers of babies will remember the cures habitually wrought on budge by singing to him boy one day
gypsies are in many respects mere children or little
there can be no doubt that where faith is very strong and imagination is lively cures which seem to border on the miraculous are often this is indeed the basis of all miracle as applied to relieving bodily afflictions
all of this may be if not as yet fully explained by physiology at least shown to probably rest on a material basis
but no sound system of cure can be founded on it because there is never any certainty especially for difficult and serious disorders that they can ever be healed twice in succession
the faith exacted is sometimes a purely hereditary gift at other times merely a form of blind ignorance and credulity
it may vividly influence all the body and it may fail to act altogether
but the faith healer and scientist or metaphysical doctor push boldly on and when they here and there heal a patient once it is published to the four winds as a proof of invariable
and as everybody believes that he has faith so he hopes to be cured
in popular custom for a man to say he believes in anything and to be sure that he really has nothing against it constitutes as much faith as most men understand
a man may be utterly destitute of any moral principle and yet live in a constant state of faith and pious conviction
here the capacity for cure by means of charms is complete
in connection with these charms for the head we may find not less interesting those in reference to the hair as given by the same authority dr von
the greatest pains are taken to ensure even for the newborn child what is called a full head because every one who dies bald is turned into a fish and must remain in this form till he has collected as many hairs as would make an ordinary wig
but this lasts a long time since he can find but a single hair every month or moon
the moon is in many ways connected in gypsy faith with the hair
he who sleeps in its light will lose his hair or else it will become white
to have a heavy growth a man must scoop up with his left hand water from a running brook against the current and pour it on his head
immediately after the first bathing of a child and its its forehead and neck are marked with a meant to indicate the with a salve called intended to promote the growth of the hair
a brew or mess is made from beans and the blood of a cow
hairs are taken from the heads of the father and mother which hairs are burnt to a powder and mixed with the brew
it is remarkable that the beans are only used for a boy their object being to insure for him great virile or sexual power
the bean says
d n is an erotic symbol or one sexual pleasure
hence it was forbidden to the priests the the priests of in and to the high priests on certain festivals
but if the child is a girl the seeds of the pumpkin or are substituted for beans because the latter would make her barren
it is an old belief and one widely spread that if the witches or the devil can get a lock of hair they can work him evil
the gypsies have the following articles of faith as regards hairs should birds find any and build them into their nests the man who lost them will suffer from headaches until during the of the moon he his head with the yolk of eggs and washes it clean in running water
it would be very curious if this method of cleaning the hair and giving it a soft gloss so much in vogue among ladies should have originated in sorcery
beyond this the sufferer must mix some of his hairs with food and give them to a white dog to eat
if hairs which have fallen or been cut away are found by a snake and carried into its hole the man from whom they came will continue to lose more until those in the snakes nest are quite decayed
if you see human hairs in the road do not tread on them since in that case if they came from a lunatic you too will go mad
according to if you pick up some hairs in the road just before entering a city gate tie one to your own head and throwing the rest away walk on without looking behind you you can cure a headache
i have found nearly the same charm for the same purpose in but accompanied by the incantation which is wanting in
also his cure for headache with ivy from the head of a statue which is still used in with the incantation which the omits
finding a hair hanging to your coat carefully burn it since you may by so doing escape injury by
and we may remark in confirmation of this that when you see a long hair on a mans coat it is an almost certain sign that he has been among the witches or is bewitched as the thought when she found one clinging to the button of her lover von as set forth in sketchbook
but to your enemy get some of his hair steep it in your own water and then throw it on his garments
then he will have no rest by night or day
i have observed that in all the charms intended to torment a foe the objects employed are like this of a disgusting nature
if a wife will hold her husband to her in love she must take of her own hair and bind it to his
this must be done three times by full moonlight
or if a maid will win the love of a young man she must take of her own hair mix it with earth from his the whole to powder and so manage that the victim shall eat it is needless to say it is not likely that he will do knowing what it is
earth from the footsteps of any one is regarded as a very powerful means of bewitching him in and ancient sorcery
if a man bind the of his hair to the of a strange horse it will be wild and shy till the hairs are removed
for easy childbirth red hair is sewed in a small bag and carried on the belly next the skin during pregnancy
red hair indicates good luck and is called or which indicates its origin
if any one dreams much of the dead let him sew some of his hair into an old shoe and give it to any beggar
thereby he will prevent evil spirits from annoying him
if a child suffers from some of its mothers hair should be sewed into its and others pulverized mixed with a of be given it to drink
in folklore as i shall show more fully the elder often occurs as a plant specially identified with sorcery
in gypsy it is called or the devils eye from its berries
nails cut on should be burned and the ashes mingled with the fodder of cattle who are thus against being stolen or attacked by wild beasts
if children are the same ashes in their food will make them grow
if a child suffers from pains in the stomach a bit of nail must be clipped from its every finger this is mixed with the dried dung of a foal and the patient exposed to the smoke while it is burned
a first tooth must when it falls out be thrown into a hollow tree
those which come out in the seventh year are carefully kept and whenever the child suffers from one is thrown into a stream
teeth which have been buried for many years serve to make a singular fetish
they are mingled with the bones of a and the whole then sewed up in a little bag
if a man has anything for sale and will draw or rub this bag over it he will have many offers or customers for the articles thus enchanted
the bones are prepared by putting the frog into a glass or receptacle full of small holes
this is buried in an
the ants enter the holes and eat away all the flesh leaving the bones which after a few weeks are removed
to bear healthy and strong children women wear a string of bears claws and teeth
dr von cites of this a passage from von von am some women when with child are accustomed to wear mounted bears claws on their necks
in like manner teeth which much resemble them are still very commonly worn in and and almost over all and the east
it is but a few days since i here in met with a young lady who had bought a very large one mounted in silver as a but who was utterly unaware that there was any meaning attached to it
i have a very ancient bears tooth and whistle in silver meant for a teething child
it came from
pain in the eyes is cured with a wash made of spring or well water and saffron
during the application the following is recited oh pain from the eyes go into the water go out of the water into the saffron go out of the saffron into the earth
to the
thy home
there go and eat
this incantation casts light upon the earliest remedies
when it was discovered that certain herbs really possessed curative qualities this was attributed to inherent magic virtues
the increase of their power by combining them with water or mingling them was due to mystic affinities by which a spirit passed from one to another
the spirit of earth went into saffron that of saffron into water
the magician thus by a song sent the pain into its medical affinity and so on back to the source whence it came
from early times saffron as one of the earliest flowers of spring owing to its was to magic and love
the goddess of the was called the one with the saffron garment
therefore the public women wore a yellow robe
even in symbolism it meant love as declares in the religion the saffron and orange were the symbols of god embracing the heart and illuminating the souls of the faithful des p
so we can trace the chain from the prehistoric barbarous preserved by the gypsies to the and from the to the form still existent
the same sympathetic process of transmission may be traced in the remedy for the erysipelas
the blood of a is put into a new vessel with scraped and then laid on a cloth with which the eyes are bound up overnight
meanwhile the patient repeats i have two eyes i have two feet pain from my eyes go into my feet go from my feet go into the earth go from the earth into death we have here in the associations of magic which are ancient and widely spread and which still exist for at the present day country people in new attribute to it curative virtues which it really does not possess
from the earliest times among the northern races the lady elder as we may learn from the or fin lexicon
and der had an ghostly reputation
growing in lonely gloomy places its form and the smell of its flowers seemed repulsive so that it was associated with death and some derived its name from frau the and goddess of death
but der with more probability traces it from ie
hollow and as spirits were believed to dwell in all hollow trees they were always in its joints
the ancient he informs us worshipped their god who was a form of in fear and trembling at dusk and left their offerings under the
everybody has seen the little puppets made of a piece of with half a bullet under them so that they always stand upright and jump up when thrown down
among the these seem to have had some magical application
perhaps their priests persuaded them that these jumping were miraculous for they called them a name derived from the underworld
they still believe in a who is a servant of the evil one
he does all kinds of for men but ends by getting their souls
the ancestors of the poles were accustomed to bury all their sins and sorrows under thinking that they thereby gave to the lower world what properly belonged to it
this corresponds accurately to the gypsy incantation which passes the disease on from the elder bark into the earth and from earth unto death
frau or was the old name for this plant
frau perhaps as appropriate to the female who dwelt in it p
when it was necessary to cut one down the peasant always knelt first before it and prayed lady give me of thy wood and i will give thee of mine when it shall grow in the forest
cites from a ms of the following non esse his mater on the other hand elder had certain protective and healing virtues
hung before a stable door it off and he who planted it evil spirits
and if a of it were planted on a grave and it grew that was a sign that the soul of the deceased was happy which is the probable reason why the very old cemetery in was planted full of elders
in a very curious and rare work entitled by john devoted to the and the author tells us that witches make great use of nine special in et est
among these is elder of which the peasants make wreaths which if they wear on night they can see the as they sweep through the air on their dragons and other strange to the dance
or when they anywhere else
yea and i know one fellow who unto men that by means of this herb he once saw certain witches churning butter busily and that on a roof but i mistrust that this was a sell and that the true name of this was p
the same author informs us that or elder is so called from or hollow or else is an anagram of spirits and some people call it from its connection with witches and debauchery even as writes when elder blossoms bloom upon the bush then hearts to sensual pleasure rush
he closes his comments on this subject with the dry remark that if the people of wear as is their wont of elder with the object of preventing of the seventh commandment among them it has in this instance at least utterly failed to produce the expected effect
it should be mentioned that in the gypsy spell the next morning the cloth with the must be thrown into the next running water
to cure the gypsies wind a round a stone which is thrown into a running stream while saying oh n n n me a p e oh pain in my teeth trouble me not so greatly do not come to me my mouth is not thy house
i love thee not all stay thou away from me when this straw is in the brook go away into the water straw was anciently a symbol of emptiness and death and it is evidently used in this sense by the gypsies or derived by them from some tradition connected with it
a feigned or fruitless marriage is indicated in by the terms and
from the earliest times in the breaking a straw signified that a compact was broken with a man because there was nothing in him
thus in the barons of the simple in him broke the straws which they held charlotte de la tour symbols of flowers
still straws have something in them
she who will lay straws on the table in the full moonlight by an open window especially on night and will repeat straw draw crow by my life i give thee law then the straws will become fairies and dance to the cawing of a crow who will come and sit on the edge of the window
and so witches were wont to make a man of straw as did mother in tale and unto these they gave life whence the saying of a man of straw and straw bail albeit this latter is deemed by some to be related to the breaking of straws and of dependence as told in the tale of the simple
is extensive and curious
as in small fairies make their homes in its tubes
to chopped straw before the house of a bride was such an insult to her character in and so common that laws were passed against it
i possess a work printed about entitled de
i per
germ
das c an immense amount of learned quotation and reference by its author indicates that this custom which was influenced by superstition was very extensively written on in its time
it was allied to the binding of knots and other magic ceremonies to prevent the consummation of marriages
there is a very curious principle involved in curing certain disorders or afflictions by means of spells or verses
a certain word is repeated many times in a mysterious manner so that it strikes the imagination of the sufferer
there is found in the countries a woolly caterpillar called whose bite or rather touch is much dreaded
i have myself when a boy been stung by such a creature in the united states
as i remember it was like the sting of a bee
the following spell against it was given me by prof in
it is supposed that a certain kind of disorder or eruption is caused by the holy
once a man drove over empty roads with empty oxen to an empty field to harvest empty corn and gather it in empty
p he gathered the empty laid them in empty wagons drove over empty roads unto an empty
the empty threshed it and bore it to the empty mill
the empty baker woman mixed it in an empty trough and baked it in an empty oven
the empty people ate the empty bread
so may the swallow this disorder from the empty here the name of the patient
what is here understood by empty is that the swelling is taken away subtracted or emptied by virtue of the repetition of the word as if one should say be thou void
depart depart depart avoid me there is a very curious incantation also apparently of origin since it refers to the spirits of the water who cause diseases
in this instance they are supposed to be by saint who is a later addition to the old spell
in the formulas these spirits are seven here they are seventy
the formula in question is against the fever in the name of god and his son and the holy ghost
amen seventy fair maids went up out of the ocean
they met the saint who asked whence come ye oh maidens they answered from the
we go into the world to break the bones of men
to give them the fever
to make hot and cold
then the holy began to beat them and gave them every one days they began to pray o holy forgive us and whoever shall bear with him thy name or write it him we will leave in peace
we will depart from him over the streams over the seas
over the and marshes
o holy of thy mercy have pity on thy slave even on the sick man the name is here uttered
free him from fever it is remarkable that as a certain mysterious worm caterpillar or small accounts differ among the is supposed to become at will a dragon or or spirit to be invoked or called on so the worm is also invoked sometimes as a saint or and sometimes as a spirit who scatters disease
the following incantation over an invalid has much in common with the old spells thou holy god calls thee unto his dwelling unto his seat
thou not remain here to break the yellow bones
to drink the red blood to dry up the white body
go forth as the bright sun goes forth over the mountains out from the veins out from the seventy limbs parts of the body
before i shall recognize thee before i did not name thee call on thee
but now i know who thou art i began to pray to the mother of god and the mother of god began to aid me
go as the wind goes over the meadows or the shore or banks as the waves roll over the waters so may the go from the man who is born who is with prayer
the worship of water as a spirit is extremely ancient and is distinctly recognized as such by the formulas of the church in which water is called this creature
the water spirits play a leading part in the gypsy mythology
the following charm to a swarm of bees was also given to me by prof who had learned it from a peasant one goes to the water and makes his prayer and the water thus hail to thee water thou water created by god and thou oh earth and ye the near springs and rivulets thou water thou over the earth over the fountains and streams down unto the sea thou dost purify the sea the sand the rocks and the roots i pray thee grant me of the water of this lake to sprinkle my bees
i will speak a word and god will give me help the mother of god the mother of will aid me and the holy father the holy and the holy when this is said take the water and bear it home without looking back
then the bees are to be sprinkled therewith
the following formula from the same authority though and gilt with is old heathen and especially interesting since prof traces it to a source charm against the bite of a serpent
the holy virgin sent a man unto mount upon this mountain is the city of and in the city of lives queen volgap
oh queen why dost thou not teach this servant of god here the name of the one bitten by a serpent is mentioned so that he may not be bitten by serpents the reply of queen not only will i teach my descendants but i also will prostrate myself before the lord god
is the name of a legendary heathen princess of who was baptized and by the church
the feminine form or corresponds to the masculine name or the earliest legendary character of

i have in the chapter on curing the disorders of children spoken of or who steals the newborn infants
she and her twelve daughters are also types of the different kinds of fever for which the gypsies have so many cures of the same character precisely as those which were used by the old
the characteristic point is that this female spirit is everywhere regarded as the cause of or fits
hence the invocation to st is used in driving them away
this invocation written is carried as an amulet or fetish
i give the translation of one of these from the in which the holy virgin is taken as the healer
it is against cramp in the night spell against
there is a mighty hill and on this hill is a golden under the golden is a golden stool
on the sits there there sits the mother of god with saint maria with the boxes in her right hand with the cup in her left
she looks up and sees naught she looks down and sees my lord and lady disease
lords and ladies cramp lord and lady and his wives
they are going to the sufferer to drink his blood and put in him a foul heart
the mother of god when she saw them went down to them spoke to them and asked them go ye lord and lady and ladies cramp c we go to to drink his blood to change his heart to a foul one
no ye shall return give him his blood back restore him his own heart and leave him immediately
cramps of the night cramps of the midnight cramps of the day cramps wherever they are

go and hide where black never crow where men never go where no beast roars
hide yourself there stop there and never show yourself more may remain pure and glad as he was made by god and was by the mother of god the spell is cure is gods
in reference to the name here identified with the mother of all devils and it was a great puzzle to the writers on why the witches always said they had two queens whom they and
the latter seems to have specially presided at the
in this we can see an evident connection with the of the new testament
i add to this a few more very curious old spells from dr work as they admirably illustrate one of the principal and most interesting subjects connected with the gypsy that is to say its relation to early and the forms in which its were expressed
in all of these it may be taken for granted from a great number of examples that the in them is recent and that they all go back to the earliest heathen times
the following formula dating from against bears the title prayer of st against snakes
in the name of the father the son and the holy ghost
i once was a but am now a true follower and i went from my in and they set light to a trunk and a snake came therefrom and bit my right hand and hung from it
but i had in me the power of god and i shook it off into the burning fire and it was destroyed and i suffered no ill from the bite
i laid myself down to sleep then the mighty angel said stand up and receive this writing and i found in it the following words i exorcise you sixty and a half kinds of beasts that creep on the earth in the name of god the creator of heaven and earth and in the name of the immovable throne
serpent of evil i exorcise thee in the name of the burning river which rises under the footstool of the saviour and in the name of his angels thou snake of the tribe of thou snake snake variegated snake snake that art on the right side of hell thou thou have no power to harm and thou must go away with all the kinds
if a man has this prayer and this curse of the true holy apostle and a snake bites him then it will die on the spot and the man that is bitten shall remain to the honour of the father the son and the holy ghost now and for all time
amen
it is not improbable that we have in and the serpent and the formula for curing its bite which is a common symbol for all disease a souvenir of the and his serpent
the following is a prayer against the to be carried about with one ie
as an amulet prayer spell for the saint sat on a stone and wept

the lord thereupon ordered the worm in tooth to come out of it and never more go in again
scarcely had the worm come out when the pain ceased
then spoke i pray you o lord that when these words be written out and a man carries them he shall have no
and the lord answered well so may it be it will hardly be urged that this charm of eastern origin could have been originated independently in
the following which is there found in the north is as remarks in the same wording was sitting on a marble stone and passed by
said my lord my god how my tooth ache said art whole and whosoever keeps these words for my sake shall never have the
the next specimen is a charm against

then stop o blood for the lords servant
i exorcise thee blood that thou in the name of the saviour and by fear of the priests when they perform the at the altar
those who sell these charms are almost universally supposed to be mere quacks and
if this were the case why do they so very carefully learn and preserve these transmitting them as a rich legacy unto their issue
but they really do believe in them and will give great prices for them
prof told me that once in it became generally known that he had made a ms collection of such spells
a peasant who was desirous of becoming a but who had very few of his own went whenever he could by stealth into the professors library and surreptitiously copied his
and when prof returned the next year to that neighbourhood he found the peasant doing a very good business as a doctor or

the latter who was at the very head of the profession sought the acquaintance because he had heard that she possessed some very valuable spells

this was upon me to ask you
you may remember then that you told me how the description of your city which we then read was more literal than is easy to be believed and withal more mystical than it is possible for the wisest of mortals to comprehend
and in particular you told me that it was built first of true and substantial gold secondly of fine gold of transparent or glassy gold and of living gold
i desire now that you would answer me to all these particulars in order
do you then say that this city is built of true gold and that it is not only said to be built of gold is it as real and substantial is it as visible and palpable and has it as many good qualities as this which i have now in my hand yes i can assure you that it is built of true and not metaphorical gold as some would have it only to be
this gold i say is no less real and substantial and no less visible and palpable to its inhabitants and has as many yea more good qualities that that which you hold in your hand and seem so pleased with
i know that this is a strange language and i shall have much to make myself understood by you but in any degree
because i must speak of that which you have never seen or handled though others have both seen and handled of it and you also may come in time to do the same
so that it will be almost as hard a matter for one that is born blind to understand the philosophy of or one born deaf the nature and distinction of sounds as for you to comprehend what i am about to say of a certain substance that is visible to some but not to you palpable to some but not to you and which therefore you have no kind of apprehension of
i promise to be very attentive
do me the favour but to satisfy me as far as you can
well i will endeavour your satisfaction after that you shall have answered me a question or two that i have to propose to you
i am very ready to do it
why do ye believe that piece of gold which ye showed me to be true real and substantial and not shadowy figurative and accidental why do i believe so i am not such a stranger to the truth as not to be able to distinguish it from a shadow
a shadow will fly from me if i go to catch at it but this i can grasp fast enough
a shadow depends on the substance and on the position of the sun which casts it
it has no figure but from the substance and that is always very faint and weak it can not be touched it has no no light no power in it
but this is ponderous bright and powerful
you see me touch it and its figure is not faint or weak but vivid and strong without depending upon anything else
wherever i move it and whatever the position of it may be to the sun or light it still retains the same shape and the same substance
and now i have it fast i dare venture its flying away
i see you are well satisfied with yourself
but pray tell me how would you give a description of it to satisfy another that had never seen it or perhaps never heard of it or if ever heard of it yet not otherwise than as a figurative sound to please children with or as a rattle a picture a shadow a name without substance without reality how would you make it to be understood to a philosopher and how to a merchant that is no philosopher supposing them both to be strangers to the nature and use of this sovereign metal truly you begin to puzzle me
and besides i can not see all your and turnings will at last lead me
indeed it would be a difficult matter to resolve satisfactorily either a philosopher or a merchant concerning this dear precious metal if they have not some manner of notice of it beforehand
but since it is not unlawful to make such a i am ready also to make such an answer as i can
i would therefore endeavour to satisfy them by making use of such ideas images and conceptions which they are already acquainted with and by compounding them and dividing them i would strive to frame in the an idea image and conception which might approach as near as possible to the truth
as for instance if i were to discourse with a philosopher whom i will suppose to live in the remotest part of or in some dark corner near to the northern pole where mines of gold were never so much as heard of and no name even found for it in the language of the country
i would think in the first place what to call it that he might in some sort apprehend me while i am with him
now because some copper mines may be near to him and he may have both seen and handled and also tried several experiments upon this metal therefore i will call it fine copper or perhaps fine brass if this be likewise known to him
then because i must speak to him in his own terms and he has used himself to those of mercury and sulphur i will tell him this fine copper is compounded of a pure mercurial water and a pure earth exactly and duly and concocted by the in some proper matrix or vessel
next i will as far as i am able show him the difference both in quantity and quality of the compounding principles of this fine copper and of his copper
whereupon i tell him that the mercurial water which enters into the composition of this fine copper is not only more subtle defecated and pure than that which is in that gothic copper of his but also that it is there in a much greater quantity
likewise i tell him that the quantity of the or earth which enters into the composition of the gothic copper is greater than that which is in this fine which i call for distinction the copper but that in the former it is more coarse than in the latter
herein lies the main difference of the and the gothic copper which i must make my philosopher understand as to the composition of the principles both in the one and the other
which are both essentially the same but diversified as well according to quality as quantity
he must then confess to me that the mercury in the gothic copper must needs be originally infected and poisoned and that there must be a defect in its proportion as likewise that the coarseness the and the of its sulphur are no inconsiderable to the perfection of this metal
and he will grant me to this i believe though he never have seen the fine metal of that there may be such a copper there found as i do describe if there may be but a mercury or water of life freed from its original infection and poison and then adapted and conjoined with a proper sulphur that shall be pure and of an nature so as not to diminish in the fires
however perhaps he will maintain that i ought not altogether to despise the earth of his copper for that though it were not so pure fixed and permanent as that of the other yet it was of the very same essence and nature with it and therefore also might possibly come to be in like manner purified and made
and when i have brought him thus far then i may speak unto him of the several properties of our fine copper and leave him to compare them with those of that coarse sort which is only known to him
and here if i could give him an exact calculation of the weight of a inch of the copper comparing it with a inch of the and showing the of that above this i should settle in him a just idea as to one property of it
another property is purity and clarity which i must in the next place give him to understand by deduction from such ideas or conceptions which he has already admitted
a third is its tincture and here as i must heighten that idea which he has entertained on one side so i must lessen it on the other that this man may exactly with the original
a fourth and main property which i am to tell him of is or the immortality and of the tincture life or soul of this metallic body
besides all which i may in the fifth place discourse to him of the extreme or of it if it might not be too prodigious for his belief and of its medicinal uses and qualities which would afford me a great variety of matters to entertain him with
and thus i shall have in some degree satisfied my or my philosopher that the fine copper of is not metaphorical or symbolical as his poor country men who have never seen it would persuade him but that it is as truly really and substantially of a metallic nature and consistence as that which he daily handles for such
and he now begins to understand how this fine copper which i otherwise call gold is compounded of the same yet better graduated principles with a more exact proportion than his and that it is not but really a metallic substance more ponderous and brighter than the other also of a bitter though not so deep tincture more fixed and and lastly more proper for human bodies to be used internally or externally when prepared according to art
so i take my leave of my philosopher and go next to my merchant
here i shall not have so much to do as with the former
i need only to mind him in brief of the several properties about which i my philosopher and then declare unto him the great and excellent use thereof in commerce so as more than four hundred times to answer the other in common valuation and often more than five hundred
enough i find you like well the subject that you are upon but hope it will serve to lead you into one that is far better
of all that you have now said nothing will be found to be in vain when i shall come to examine you
the tables may come perhaps to be turned upon yourself
let me persuade you to try thoroughly whether that be indeed gold which you believe to be so
but since you have been pleased to satisfy me as to what i demanded i am now most ready to satisfy you as to what was only i must first premise two or three things that i may be understood by you
be now attentive and consider well what i am about to say
i will be sure sir to attend your motion for i begin to be very jealous that you have been carrying on all this while some plot to undermine me
but pray let us hear your premises and i promise to make the best use of all the ears and eyes which i have
the first thing that i wish then to premise is this that the divine blessing was originally spoken forth upon the whole creation of god
or as some would rather choose to express it it was outspoken into the creation that is by a real vital and essential infusion into it
so that whatever come out of the hands of god was good
no evil should ever be derived from the divine being who notwithstanding the supreme liberty of will is necessitated when he acts to act according to goodness
no sin nor death no or drought no weakness or could at all proceed from him
he rejoicing as it were in the works of his hands pronounced them both severally and universally to be good yea very good as considered in their whole system and harmonious union with each other
i must grant that you say
but i would see to what purpose it will serve you
you may yet before we part
i can not deny but that god blessed the whole creation and that all the works of his hands are good
make your best of it
the second thing that i have to premise is but as a corollary from the former and is strengthened by universal experience
it is this the works of the creation are not now in the same state as they were when they first came out of the hands of god or as when the divine blessing was pronounced upon them or outspoken onto them yet with this limitation so far as they are within our sphere or orb
for experience at this day too sufficiently attest that the creatures whether they be of the animal vegetable or mineral kingdom can not be all said to be good they be considered either separately by themselves or in harmony with the rest
and whatever may be pleaded on their behalf by some acute philosophers and that all the creatures are even at this day good though not positively yet relatively and with respect both to their present constitution and the constitution of the world in general it is evident to me at least if either the records of scripture or the natural light of reason may judge of the appeal that all that they can say will if it prove any thing certainly to the very overturning of the positive goodness of the divine the introducing in the room thereof a certain relative hypothetical and imaginary goodness and to the building up a very odd and irregular system of the universe
this if it were necessary i might at large deduce through several particulars proving the absurdity and inconsistency of such a that has been taken up of late by some men of name and by them too to the of god though they might not perhaps design it so as i am apt both to hope and believe
but this would lead me out very far and keep me too long from the resolution of the question in hand
however if at any other time you think it worth your while to demand a particular satisfaction as to this point i shall be most willing to give it to you
i thank you
at present i am well enough satisfied in this matter yea so much as i have often with my self admired even when bit by a how any could be serious in pleading for the perfection of the present constitution of the world of nature as if it never had been better or was never to be better but after it shall have lasted out such a term that it must return back again into its primitive state of nothingness by the most dreadful dissolution through fire
this their catastrophe of our world i must confess did never very well please me but did always stick
its is then granted by you that the present constitution of this terrestrial world in which we live is not so perfect and good as it was originally brought forth by god and that it may by the gift of god recover again its original constitution
it is granted
well answer me now this one question
which do you now think best deserves to be called by this or that name that which is most perfect in its kind and that which comes up most really to the true and original frame of its nature or that which falls short of it and is very imperfect as to its kind as for instance you take two sheep or two horses and of these let one be placed at the right hand and the other at the left
suppose now the horse at the right hand to have all the most excellent features and proportions of an horse and that at the left to have none of them at all but to be very mean and
suppose also the sheep at the right hand to be very plump and fat and to wear a golden upon its back and that at the left to be lean and
will you say that the horse at the left hand is a real horse but that at the right a metaphorical one or that the sheep at the left is a true sheep but not that at the right and will you not rather say that these by approaching nearer to the perfection of their nature and to the original integrity and beauty in which they were first both brought forth from the divine exemplar do less deserve to be called figurative or allegorical than the other
so indeed it seems to me if either of these may be called a figurative sheep or a figurative horse it must be the ones who come not up to the primitive constitution of their nature into which the divine blessing was spoken but have fallen under the curse and suffered the of their first pure form according to the that is granted you
and if any one had ever seen such an other but such lean and sheep or such ill conditioned and jakes i say should much condemn his if he should say there were no other but positively conclude these to be the best of the kind and that above them are but hypothetical metaphors or expressions of somewhat transcending nature
yea i should be a little angry if he should be so obstinate as to stand out against the authentic relations of ocular witness or go to oblige me to deny my own senses because his have not had the same experience which mine also had
suppose also that you have two bushels of wheat the one whereof is half full of the other perfectly cleansed the one blighted the other large and sound
would you say that the blighted and corn is only real and substantial but the sound and the cleansed to be no more than a metaphor or a shadow
i believe not
suppose once more that you have two of wine the one natural and unsophisticated clean and sprightly the other pipe sophisticated and filled up half with water and that you have tasted only of the latter
would you say that this only is true wine and not the other no i think i should not so far expose my own judgment
and though i should not have tasted of the finest wine yet would i not say there is no better than that i have tasted and assert that what i am told of the other is only fancy or figure
now my dear hold to your words
for i see two pieces of gold the one as at your right hand the other is at your left the one celestial gold the other terrestrial gold like as there are bodies celestial and bodied terrestrial
the gold of your left hand you see and handle and say therefore that it is substantial
the gold of the right hand you see not neither can you handle and conclude therefore that it is shadowy
the reason whereof is this
the former has a peculiar virtue in it to blind that eye by which the former gold may be discerned and to induce such a numbness and deadness on all one part of the man that has a lust after it that he can not possibly feel or handle the other till his disease be first removed from him
but as for me that gold which you call substantial i should of the two rather choose to call shadowy gold and that which you think to be shadowy and figurative i must call substantial and real on far greater reasons than you have produced to move me to the contrary
i can not but believe my senses
you shall not easily persuade me out of them
for if they deceive me i can be certain of nothing
be not afraid you may keep your senses still for me
since the senses deceive none but it is the judgment which is made upon them that may be erroneous
take care therefore that you judge not amiss and think that to be in the object itself which is nothing but an impression produced by it upon the sensory
but tell me do you ever dream yes i do
you may then remember how you thought that you have seen felt and handled various objects which have vanished away as soon as you awakened
i do
and particularly i call to mind how i have sometime thought myself to be rolling among bags of gold
so that it has been no small trouble to me to find myself in the morning
forget not this
the application will not be difficult and very nearly concerns you my friend
you are in a dream at this very instant and you will certainly find yourself in the morning when your senses that are now locked up in sleep shall recover themselves
in a dream say you nay then the whole world is a dream
all that i do is dream and fancy and whatever i behold or handle is but a shadow
will you make all the world beside yourself to be in a dream will you make all the in it all the negotiations and wars with all manner of transactions private and public civil and religious to be nothing more but the imaginations of the night will you make nothing to be real or substantial of what is seen felt heard or understood by us poor mortals you are no
no i am an eclectic
but yet i have found the good of scepticism as to many things that you believe
and if it go not too far it is the foundation of all solid knowledge natural political or divine
however strange it may appear to you it is not very far from the truth to say that this world with all that is in it is but a dream or a shadow when compared with the invisible worlds
i am afraid to press you too much with these matters and therefore i only said it is not very far from the truth to say so but the indubitable records wherein in manifestly the finger of god would bear me out if i should say that it is the very truth itself
search into these and you will find enough to open your eyes and let you see that the form of this world away and that all that belongs to it is no more than as a vision of the might which flies away with the day break
my thoughts have been formerly the same with yours the poisoned cup from the hand of the fair whom i have mentioned to you cast me into a deep sleep
and in it i remember i had just the same dreams which you have now
i thought terrestrial gold was as substantial as you imagine it to be and of the celestial gold i had no manner of apprehension but was contented to look on it as a figure and not as a substance
but i was roused out of my sleep by a swift messenger out of the heavenly upon which all the enchanted scenes of the night immediately fled away and i awakened recovering the senses which had been before up and then i quickly perceived my errors
ah awake awake there stands now at your right hand one of the citizens of that beautiful city who holds before him a medal made of the same gold which he would present to you if you would but suffer your eyes to be opened and would not hold so fast the shadow
what mean you to do with me oh a little more sleep a little more slumber a little more of this worlds and then i awake
disturb me not
he talks in his sleep
 you will not yet be awakened i find
i will therefore for a little time grant you your hearts desire and this once suppose that you are not asleep while you sleep but that your dream is a reality and all the conclusions that you have made from the exercise of your outward senses to be true
for by of reason even granting what you say as you do conclude the terrestrial gold to be true real and substantial i do conclude the celestial to be so and much more so
if you plead sensation for yours i know those that plead it for ours and that deserve as much at least to be believed as any that you bring
but lest you might not so readily believe or apprehend perhaps the witnesses that i could produce i will proceed with you as you would do with your or that had never heard of the gold mines of
i must needs tell you that if the gold be true gold then the gold deserves also of right so to be called yea is much better qualified of the two to bear this name as it is more perfect in its kind and as it more nearly approaches then the former to the true and original frame of pure and nature exactly compounded according to the divine exemplar and duly concocted in the bowels of the everlasting mountains the mountains of the sun and the mountains of the moon
whence supposing the difference of and gold to be as the difference of and gothic copper this will not but that the gold both according to the greater purity of its constituent principles as without the least alloy of the curse and the most exact proportion of then may well deserve to be looked on no less real than the
if it be so pray dear give me some of it that i may make a proof
you are not yet out of your dream you know not what you say
for you neither understand what manner of gold this is neither who it is that can give it
it may be called to you by a thousand names but i do assure you that it is true and proved gold
and let me tell you that your gold or the false brass of is not constituted of principles altogether pure and but mixed with some close and inherent imperfections
neither are the proportions adjusted according to perfect nature but only according to the perfect constitution of this terrestrial orb
the curse that has entered into the whole lower creation has also entered into this and it is not a perfect metal except with respect to the lapsed and broken frame of this our earth
i am wondering where you will run at last
i am not so much in a dream but i can laugh at these amusements of yours
did ever any before deny gold to be a perfect metal mistake me not
i do not deny it to be a perfect metal with respect to the present order of things in their fallen state
but i do positively that it is not a perfect metal with respect to that primitive and original order of beings which proceeded immediately from god through his word wherein and whereby they subsist but that it partakes of the curse as well as all the other subjects of the mineral or metallic kingdom though not in the same degree
now there is an inherent curse and there is also an adherent curse and of both of these it more or less participates
pray what do you mean by an inherent curse and how do you appropriate it to the terrestrial gold
know what is the blessing and you can not fail to know what is the curse in nature
there is an inherent blessing in every creature and there is also an adherent blessing
without the former god could never have pronounced them good and without the latter they could never have been serviceable to man or to the rest of their fellow creatures
a or loss in either of these kinds is called the curse
and as it has diverse degrees and is variously specified so takes it up diverse names as death darkness the the left hand the seed of the serpent the mist out of the earth poison the blood of the old dragon the prisons the north and many others
the benediction now of both kinds may be lessened hidden or removed either in part of in whole
the adherent benediction may possibly admit of a total remove and separation but the inherent can never do this without the destruction and annihilation of the subject wherein it is
whence though it may be hid yet can it never be separated without the entire disunion of its constituent and vital principles
which are not perishable but endure the same notwithstanding all the veils and coverings wherewith they may be overcast or oppressed and which are said to be under the of so many evil angels
behold then here is wisdom to take away the inherent curse from the creature and to cause the disappeared blessing to reappear and exert forth itself
now shall you understand how this curse is to be appropriated to the terrestrial gold and how the contrary blessing is to be of the celestial
but in the first place you are to take notice that as the inherent is here less than in any other subjects of the same kingdom and order so the adherent curse is greater
in the second place you are to observe that the primary and radical principles being as to us invisible in themselves the secondary and elementary which may be made visible can be here only examined into
in the third place i am now to acquaint you that these elementary principles which i call also as i call the former seminal are vastly different in the state of pure and of corrupt nature
for in pure nature there is found a bright living crystalline water full of spirit power and energy but in nature corrupted there is a water that is opposite to this being without light life or purity without spirituality or strength and void of all benign efficacy
as a pool remote from the sun beams or as a dead insipid is not to be regarded or valued so likewise there is found a bright living and crystalline earth such as hath been and such as will be and such as is even at this time when it appears not except to some few which is sometimes compared to fine silver and is called the salt of the earth
and in this blessed earth is locked up the spirit energy and seed of the mineral and vegetable kingdoms in their purest constitution yea and of the animal too
for that it contains in itself the fire of nature by which the wheel of her according to all the seven forms and spirits is set to work
on the contrary there is a dull dead and earth that is mixed more or less with all terrestrial subjects and that may by art be separated from them
this is the curse of the earth which must be taken away and dissolved before the blessed and new earth can appear it is called the damned earth
i hope you will not say that there is any of what the call damned earth in this our gold
for i can not bear the thought of it
pray therefore explain yourself here a little
it is you yourself that make the particular application for i did not
and indeed sir i was almost afraid to touch you so near the quick
but if your gold be a terrestrial subject which you will scarce deny then i am sure it must have some share of this damned earth in it
for the curse has not a command to stop when it came to a mine of gold but like a it passed through and through and infected the whole earth and all that belonged to it
there might not indeed so much of it here abide as elsewhere and therefore i said there was less of the inherent curse in this than in any other subject of the same kingdom or order
yet there is some and that too very considerable if either reason or experience may be allowed to pass the judgment
but this would lead us too far into a philosophical
let it suffice at present to consider whether what a vulgar and ordinary artist may be able to give an ocular demonstration of in the greatest part of earthly subjects an expert master may not be as able to give the same in all be not angry dear sir at what i have asserted but learn to bear the thought of what will be so much your disappointment as to let you see the fair idol of your heart is not so lovely as you have imagined it to be and that it is not all true gold that in your hand
there is a damned earth terra et that so fast to it as is not easily to be separated by the art
and i am informed from credible that whosoever shall be understanding in heart and skillful in hand to separate this vile earth from the precious solar earth in the body of terrestrial gold shall find the quantity of the former however small when compared to the inferior metals to exceed the other
and if what is related concerning the degradation of gold by an eminent and curious eyewitness of this nation whom all the philosophical and world stands obliged to and who had this generous and noble design to vindicate religion from all sectarian polity or and to establish it upon solid and immutable grounds be true and if also the daily experiments made even in ordinary laboratories of the possibility of its and exaltation by losing in its weight and so possessing an higher tincture and clarity may deserve any credit then is it certain that it may still arrive to an higher degree both of and purity than it could ever meet with in the bowels of the earth
but whether this can ever be quite set free from its inherent curse or no is not so material to our present purpose
however there is a vein i can assure you of gold which not having been with it infected is by pronounced to be good genesis
and yet even this is no more to be compared with the or gold than the is with it
hereby you may in part i hope apprehend what is meant both by the blessing and the curse which are inherent in this metallic body
i do i think pretty well understand you
but pray what do you mean by an adherent curse and how is that to be appropriated to the terrestrial gold the adherent curse is that which adheres or to the creature by external application and not by internal constitution or composition
and here by external application i mean not barely any outward abuse of the same whatever but also and chiefly any degree of adhesion of the human soul to it how intrinsic and the more intrinsic still the more dangerous it being foreign incongruous and both to the soul and to the creature which she seeks to as to her blessing
now though your terrestrial gold has indeed not so much of the inherent yet has it far more of the adherent curse which is much the worst of the two
and though it should be never so perfect as to its composition that not if this other curse sticks to it
yea on the contrary this will be so much the greater and the heavier as in the case of the
of those angels who kept not their first estate of adhesion to the original beauty and goodness and in that of the golden calf of concerning which the have to this very day a celebrated proverb that no punishment is ever inflicted upon them in which there is not some portion of this calf
and i fear the same may be justly applicable not to them alone
what evil of sin is there in the whole world that is not perpetrated for the sake of it and what evil of pain or dreadful judgments by the divine nemesis have not already been pulled down upon particular persons upon families and upon whole kingdoms behold and consider the times of old what examples all histories both sacred and profane give you
to conclude how many are there that for the sake of this labour the greatest part of their lives in the very fire who at length reap but smoke and dross in the room of those golden mountains which they hereby imagined to themselves and how many weary themselves all their lives for very vanity while being deceived with the false show of an blessing they find only misery and repentance who had they taken but half that pains to discover the or mine of gold would never have been left in such plunges at the last behold all this proceeds from its adherent curse
remember the dying of the richest subject of the world at that time as well as the best politician and the most faithful servant which famous is i suppose not unknown to you
you mean i know the saying of that great man which he left in his legacy to posterity had i but taken but half that pains to serve my god as i took to serve my prince he would not now have deserted me
i do so
and withal i assure you my good friend that if you were but half as diligent in seeking after the celestial as you are in seeking after the terrestrial gold you would be experimentally convinced that i have spoken nothing to you all this while but the very truth and you would find yourself possessed of substance instead of vanity
i am at a loss
i know not what to make of that which you say
disturb me not out of my sleep
for i would rather dream on at the old rate than be
have pity on me and depart from me
for i am
i am a lover of that what you have nicknamed terrestrial gold
the which to me is a celestial substance
but you will hardly allow it to be a substance at all that so you may the more exalt the gold as you call it of your own country which i must call imaginary
tell me not then that mine is vanity or the shadow only of a substance
neither speak to me of for smoke and dross
i know what is substance i thank my stars and i can distinguish between what is true and what is counterfeit
mine hath been tried in the fire and weighed in the balance
it hath stood in the one and in the other hath been found to have its just weight
can you also pretend to this yes more than pretend
mine is indeed gold tried in the fire and it has been also weighed in the balance as well as yours
and let me tell you besides that your gold shall never be able to endure this but shall fly away in it as lead and dross
and one grain of the gold of my city if put into the balance will this whole room full of yours
whence the crown that is mad out of this gold is called emphatically a weight of glory and an or excessive weight yea a far exceeding and hyperbolically weight
so far exceeds the celestial gold in the terrestrial gold when weighed together as no hyperbole can reach
it exceeds in like manner in clarity and lustre in and in the of its tincture in and and in all manner of medicinal uses both for spirit soul and body all which it and
and in the last place all the merchandise of your world is not to be compared with it
this alone can truly and really and make you rich
it would not be difficult to each of these and to show hereby the reality and of this gold that i plead for not only equally with but far above that which is dug out of the earth
but all that can be said would but serve so much the more to exasperate you if you comprehend it not or will not attend to it
in vain therefore would it be for me to give you at present a particular description of its several properties as also of its constituent principles and the manner of their union
i must wait to do that till those senses which are fallen asleep in you shall come to be awakened
but i am therefore sent that i might rouse you out of your sleep
forgive me that i thus wake you
o what has become of the of arise and your eyes
hold i think i now begin to see
i must confess that i can now see the possibility of what you drive at but that it is actually so i can not yet perceive
i remember i was once a little acquainted with one that might possibly be of your society and i did hear him exclaim from the pulpit in this manner think ye ye shall be set up as pillars in the temple of god to uphold it or that you shall be full of gold in you pockets of the finest gold tried in the fire like the rich men of the earth and to it in and fine as those in princes courts do you think that these things are here meant in these promises made to the seven churches no no dream of no such things for i say there is not one word true according to the letter
i do say that every word every syllable every letter is true and that there are real and substantial pillars in the temple of god real and substantial gold in the city of god and real and substantial worn by the citizens thereof
and yet at the same time i do assert that there is no word syllable or letter true if strictly taken according to that low idea which the natural man has fixed to these words
for as much as there is a more than excess in the difference of one from the other
as each property by itself considered will manifest
and if you are convinced of the possibility at least of what i have said you must acknowledge the actual existence
for that there can be no other reason invented whereby you deny it but its impossibility and inconsistency
i resign therefore and yield to you that the city of may be built of true real and substantial gold which has nothing of the curse either inherent or adherent sticking to it according to the sense that the means or that you explain though not according to that which the natural man would have
you comprehend me right
i shall therefore proceed
i said then in the second place that it is built of fine gold much more fine and higher graduated than any you can ever have seen
this you may in part already understand by what has been said hitherto
but here i shall much more stand in need of words whereby to express myself
i long greatly to hear you speak distinctly of this and gold
i shall not forget what you have said
therefore proceed on
you need but remember your gothic philosopher
consider also that there is a twofold body there is a material and elementary body and there is an spiritual and a heavenly body
the one is gross the other fine
i can understand perfectly what you mean by the former but the notion of an immaterial body seems to me the very same contradiction as that of an immaterial substance seemed to an eminent of materialism called
if you had but him to deal with he would make work i believe with your and spiritual body
it may be so
but i never feared the strength of reasoning in though i know him pretty well and all his principles whether in philosophy divinity or politics are opposite to mine
he is the express character of the natural man throughout and in his works everywhere you have the most lively image of the fallen state of nature whereof great advantage may be made by the wise it being no where that i know so deeply and philosophically handled
this indeed he mistakes for the true and original state of nature but herein he speaks well enough and true enough as a natural or animal man and without deviating most exactly follows his principles wherever they lead him
on the other side the most learned and profound of all his very admirably both describes and demonstrates the true and original state of nature such as it was and such as it shall be again but not such as it is at present
as for he is not dead but lives in his disciples and will live as long as the present corrupt state of nature shall remain upon the earth
for the psyche in man is never able to penetrate beyond the image only the pure spirit of can reach to the life which is so out in discourse
hence he who had only the psyche was not able to distinguish the one and the other but he took them both to be the same
so finding in the origination of several languages that a spirit was forth or signified by breath he presently concludes that the spirit and breath were one and the same and consequently that all spirits as such were material and corporeal beings
he in the like manner finding in the verbal image of substance was expressed that which stands under or props up somewhat entertained immediately a most gross and sensible conception and tied it down to matter
so then nothing could be a greater absurdity to him or a more manifest contradiction than to believe an immaterial substance that is an immaterial matter
now among those who have a great and just for his sentiments all are not set free themselves from the very same method of argumentation as from a numerous induction of instances might be verified if need were
i shall only beg of you what is highly necessary in order to your understanding of what i speak and to your passing a judgment thereupon that you content not yourself with the lax and popular sense of a word as that which is generally very equivocal but that you seek out the strict and close idea that is to be affixed to it for the removal of all ambiguity in the terms and the distinction of the image from its original or as the schools would rather speak of the from the sign from the thing signified
it is very just what you require
none can this method after what the celebrated author of an essay on human understanding together with a philosopher of the first magnitude have written on it shall be looked into
tell me in the first place what you mean by substance hereby i understand that which hath both essence and existence being created by god and made capable of bearing up or supporting various modes of being
what do you mean by body hereby i understand a substance that is extended and is capable of various modes of extension
two of which modes are and
is then a mode of extension i always thought that all matter was impenetrable
true
all matter is impenetrable but all body is not
and is as much a mode of extension as
for where there is no there is no penetration and where there is no penetration there can be no life
without therefore all nature were dead it remains that extended substances may be penetrated
now there are extended substances or rather one extended substance of which i may speak to you hereafter which can penetrate others but which can not be penetrated by any
there are also extended substances which can penetrate others by and which may themselves also be penetrated by others
lastly there are extended substances or bodies which can not penetrate others but which may be penetrated by them
thus by the outward light of this world which is a body of the second order the earth may be penetrated which can neither penetrate it or any other substance
what do you mean by matter hereby i understand a body that is impenetrable and divisible and which is capable of various modes of division
so that all matter is body but all body is not matter
by impenetrable i mean not that which can not be at all penetrated but i mean that which is not to be penetrated by any thing of its own order and which itself can penetrate nothing
how can the same body be impenetrable and divisible because it is impenetrable therefore it is divisible into parts
for if it could be penetrated then would there be no need of division or separation of the parts that which is is also indivisible or rather and consequently incorruptible
i comprehend your meaning
and now i conceive what is your notion of an immaterial or spiritual body called likewise a which is a or heavenly body namely that it is an extended substance indivisible and incorruptible
as on the contrary your notion of a material and elementary body must be this that it is an extended substance impenetrable penetrated divisible and corruptible
i begin consequently to understand a little your notion of material and spiritual of elementary and heavenly gold and why you call the one gross and the other fine gold
but notwithstanding that i conceive how the material and elementary gold is an extended substance which is impenetrable to all terrestrial bodies and may be penetrated by the celestial which is also divisible into parts yea into the atoms yet can i not easily yield that it should be corruptible
all that is compounded of elements must be more or less corruptible
and though certain elementary bodies may have arrived at some degree of incorruptibility yet it is but a degree it being impossible for them to be ever perfectly freed from corruption but by a dissolution and a
for this is a most assured maxim that all things must be perfected upon the cross and all things must be tried by fire without passing through the cross there is no resurrection without passing through the fire there is no or no purification or
hence the messenger of the covenant of immortality is by a certain prophet compared to a fire who saith of him that he shall purify the and purge them as gold that they may rightly offer the sacrifice of to
hence also a great and wise king saith the word or emanation of the lord is refined and again he cries out thy word is exceedingly refined most fine and pure
and likewise this very word of the lord or the word the lord saith to the shepherds of i will refine them as silver is refined and will try them as gold is tried
and elsewhere he saith i have refined thee melted thee down and then brought thee out of the furnace
for this cause the precious sons of are compared to fine gold and the man who appeared to had his loins with fine gold of
from this also an account may be given why the altar of incense was made of refined gold together with the and the also why oracle is so often compared to fine gold and lastly why the describes both the head and the feet of her beloved to be as of fine gold that is such an indivisible and incorruptible substance as being extended is therefore a body and as possessing all the properties of the material and gross gold is therefore a spiritual body or immaterial and celestial gold
i must confess that i have always taken a spiritual body to be a contradiction in terms for i never heard otherwise before but that spirit and body were
but now i begin to mistrust that i have not been used rightly to apply ideas to words
your diffidence is well grounded
for i do not find that spirit and body are anywhere opposed as in those writings which command the greatest authority and deference above all others to them
i find indeed frequently spirit and flesh to be set as but spirit and body never
nay i find it there expressly asserted that there is a natural body and there is a spiritual body
and so in like manner there is a natural gold and there is a spiritual which the former as the spiritual body of the resurrection this natural and elementary body which we now wear about us
moreover the same highly mystic author tells those who being immersed in the flesh had no notion of a spiritual or heavenly body any more than you had
there are also celestial bodies of a spiritual and heavenly property and bodies terrestrial of a material and earthly property as common gold but the glory of the celestial is one and the glory of the terrestrial is another that is the glory of the gold differs from the glory of the as far as heaven is from earth
you extremely amaze me good to tell me that the city from whence you are named is built of such fine gold
but pray now go on if you are not weary to satisfy me in the third place whether it be built of transparent and glassy gold
be not over hasty but take time to meditate upon what i through the assistance of the good spirit have freely communicated to you
neither have i done yet with the former for i am not yet come to the top of the ladder with you
perhaps your head may be giddy in to reach it at this present
though i can not be ever weary of these matters yet i will now take my leave of you with one parallel instance which you may digest against we meet the next time
consider what difference there is the of any terrestrial subject from which the spirit is separated and the spirit itself of that very subject which is a spiritual body when seven times and hereby as in a glass you may discern how far that gross and earthly gold i am speaking of wherewith the holy city of my brethren is built
in the meanwhile i shall leave with you this figure of a star being the mark of this gold and also of the city showing its constituent parts the water and fire of the it manifold and wonderful properties how it is formed and how it is made to multiply itself
as the philosophers say is composed from the noble mineral sulphur and they have praised it as the black lead of the wise
the in their language have called it the retain the name
it will however lead to the consideration of high secrets if we seek and recognize the nature in which the sun is exalted as the found that this mineral was attributed by god to the which is the first heavenly sign in which the sun takes its exaltation or elevation to itself
although such things are thrown to the winds by common people intelligent people ought to know and pay more attention to the fact that exactly at this point the of secrets may be partly contemplated with great profit and in part also explored
many but these are ignorant and are of the opinion that if they only had they would get to it by others by several by reverberation and extraction and obtain its great secret oil and
but i tell you that here in this place nothing will help whether reverberation nor extraction so that subsequently a perfect extraction of metallic virtue that translates the inferior into the superior may profitably come to pass or be accomplished
for such shall be impossible for you
do not let yourselves be confused by several of the philosophers who have written of such things ie
and many more of that kind
and this you should note
yes many say that when one prepares to a glass then the evil volatile sulphur will be gone and the oil which may be prepared from the glass would be a very fixed oil and would then truly give an and medicine of imperfect metals to perfection
these words and opinions are perhaps good and right but that it should be thus in fact and prove itself this will not be
for i say to you truly without any hidden speech if you were to lose some of the above mentioned sulphur by the preparation and the burning as a small fire may easily damage it so that you have lost the right penetrating spirit which should make our whole corpus into a perfect red oil so that it also can ascend over the helm with a sweet smell and very beautiful colors and the whole body of this mineral with all its members without loss of any weight except for the shall be an oil and go over the helm
and note also this how would it be possible for the body to go into an oil or give off its sweet oil if it is put into the last essence and degree for glass is in all things the and least essence
for you shall know that all creatures at the end of the world or on the last and coming judgement of the last day shall become glass or a lovely and this according to the families of the twelve as in the families of jewels which the great describes in his book as we have elaborately reported and taught in our book de
you shall also know that you shall receive the perfect noble red oil which serves for the translation of metals in vain if you pour over the and extract the
yes not even by reverberation and even if its manifold beautiful colors show themselves this will not make any difference and is not the right way
you may indeed obtain and make an oil out of it but it has no perfect force and virtue for transmutation or translation of the imperfect metals into perfection itself
this you must certainly know
and now we proceed to the manual labour and thus the follows
take in the name of god and the holy fine and well cleansed which looks nice white pure and internally full of yellow rivulets or veins
it may also be full of red and blue colors and veins which will be the best
pound and grind to a fine powder and dissolve in a water or which will be described below finely so that the water may conquer it
and note that you should take it out quite soon after the solution so that the water may conquer it
and note that you should take it out quite soon after the solution so that the water will have no time to damage it since it quickly the tincture
for in its nature our water is like the which by its heat and consumes all iron for given time the water would consume it and burn it to naught so that it would only remain as an idle yellow earth and then it would be quite
consider by comparison beautiful clean and pure dissolved in this our water
and let it remain therein for no more than a single night when the water is still strong and full of spirit and i tell you that your good has then been fundamentally consumed and destroyed and brought to in this our water
and if you want to reduce it to a pure corpus again then you will not succeed but it will remain for you as a pale yellow earth and occasionally it may run together in the shape of a horn or white which may not be brought to a corpus by any art
therefore you must remember to take the out as soon as possible after the solution and precipitate it and wash it after the custom of the so that the matter with its perfect oil is not and consumed by the water
the water wherein we dissolve the is made thus take vitriol one and a half
lb
one pound one half pound one and a half pound commune one pound one half pound
these are the species that belong to and should be taken for the water to dissolve the
take these species and mix them well among each other and from this a water at first rather slowly
for the go with great force more than in other strong waters
and beware of its spirits for they are subtle and harmful in their penetration
when you now have the dissolved clean and well and its sharp waters washed out so that you do not notice any sharpness any more then put into a clean and it with a good distilled vinegar
then put the in or to forty ali four days and nights and it will dissolve and be extracted red as blood
then take it out and examine how much remains to be dissolved and the clear and pure which will have a red very cautiously into a glass flask
then pour fresh vinegar onto it and put it into as before so that that which may have remained with the it should thus have ample time to become dissolved
then the may be discarded for they are no longer useful except for being scattered over the earth and thrown away
afterwards pour all the solutions together into a glass retort put into and the sharp vinegar rather a fresh one since the former would be too weak and the matter will very quickly become dissolved by the vinegar
it off again so that the matter remains quite dry
then take common distilled water and wash away all sharpness which has remained with the matter from the vinegar and then dry the matter in the sun or otherwise by a gentle fire so that it becomes well dried
it will then be fair to behold and have a bright red color
the philosophers when they have thus prepared our in secret have remarked how its nature and power has collapsed into its interior and its interior thrown out and has now become an oil that lies hidden in its innermost and depth well prepared and ready
and henceforth it can not unto the last judgement be brought back to its first essence
and this is true for it has become so subtle and volatile that as soon as it senses the power of fire it flies away as a smoke with all its parts because of its
several poor and common laborers when they have prepared the thus have taken one part out to take care of their expenses so that they may more easily do the rest of the work and complete it they then mixed it with one part one part vitro
 one part to the and then proceeded to project this mixture onto a pure
and if the was one mark they found two and a half good gold after separation sometimes even more
and therewith they had accomplished a work providing for their expenses so that they might even better expect to attain to the great work
and the foolish called this a bringing into the but they are mistaken
for such gold is not brought in by the
but any contains two mark gold to the some even more
but this gold is united to the lunar nature to such a degree that it may not be separated from it neither by nor by common as the know
when however the just mentioned mixture is thrown onto the in flux then such a separation takes place that the quite readily gives away her implanted gold either in or in regal and lets herself separate from it strikes it to the ground and it which would or might otherwise not happen
therefore it is not a bringing into the but a bringing out of the
but we are coming back to our and purpose of our work for we wish to have the oil which has only been known and been acquainted with this and not by the foolish
when you then have the well according to the above given teaching then you shall take a well and pour it over the red powder of put it in a gentle to dissolve for four days and nights so that everything becomes well dissolved
if however something should remain behind you the same with fresh and put it into the again as said before and everything should become well dissolved
and in case there are some more there but there should be very little do them away for they are not useful for anything
the put into a glass retort lute on a helm and connect it to a receiver also well to receive the
put it into
thereafter you begin in the name of god to very leisurely at a gentle heat until all the has come over
you then pour the same that you have drawn off back onto the dry matter and it over again as before
and this pouring on and distilling off again you continue so often until you see the ascend and go over the helm in all kinds of
then it is time to follow up with a strong fire and a noble blood red will ascend go through the tube of the helm and drip into the recipient
truly this is the most secret way of the wise to the very highly praised oil of and it is a noble powerful fragrant oil of great virtue as you will hear below in the following
but here i wish to teach and instruct you who are poor and without means to expect the great work in another manner not the way the ancients did it by separating the gold from the
therefore take this oil one lot ancient weight unit used for the weighing of gold and silver coins about pound eight lot of according to art and carefully imbibe the oil drop by drop while continuously stirring the
then put it ten days and nights in the heat in the furnace of secrets and let the fire that this furnace contains increase every other day by one degree
the first two days you give it the first degree of fire the second two days you give it the second degree and after four days and nights you put it into the third degree of fire and let it remain there for three days and nights
after these three days you open the window of the fourth degree for which likewise three days and nights should be sufficient
then take it out and the top of the becomes very beautiful and of a reddish yellow
this should be melted with
when this has been done you will find that the power of our oil has changed it to good gold
thus you will again have subsistence so that you may better expect the great work
we now come back to our purpose where we left it earlier
above you have heard and have been told to the with the over the helm into the recipient as well as the work of changing the into gold
but now we wish to make haste and report about the second work
here it will be necessary to separate the from the oil again and you shall know that it is done thus take the mixture of oil and wine spirit put it into a retort put on a helm connect a receiver and place it all together into the
then all the from the oil at a very gentle heat until you are certain that no more is to be found within this very precious oil
and this will be easy to check for when you see several drops of ascend over the helm and fall into the recipient this is the sign that the has become separated from the oil
then remove the fire from the though it was very small so that it may cool all the sooner
now remove the recipient containing the and keep it in a safe place for it is full of which it has extracted from the oil and retained
it also contains admirable virtues as you will hear hereafter
but in the you will find the blessed in the retort which should be taken out very carefully
the helm must be very slowly removed taking care to soften and wash off the lute so that no dirt falls down into the beautiful red oil and makes it
this oil you must store with all possible precaution so that it receives no damage
for you now have a heavenly oil that shines on a dark night and light as from a glowing coal
and the reason for this is that its innermost power and soul has become thrown out unto the and the hidden soul is now revealed and shines through the pure body as a light through a lantern just as on judgement day our present invisible and internal souls will manifest through our clarified bodies that in this life are and dark but the soul will then be revealed and seen unto the of the body and will shine as the bright sun
thus you now have two separate things both the spirit of wine full of force and wonder in the arts of the human body and then the blessed red noble heavenly to translate all diseases of the imperfect metals to the perfection of gold
and the power of the spiritual wine reaches very far and to great heights
for when it is rightly used according to the art of medicine i tell you you have a heavenly medicine to prevent and to cure all kinds of diseases and ailments of the human body
and its uses are thus as follows against or gout in the case of gout one should let three drops of this that has received the power of the fall into a small glass of wine
this has to be taken by the patient on an empty stomach at the very moment in time when he sense the beginning or arrival of his trouble bodily ailment and pain
on the next day and afterwards on the third day it should also be taken and used in the same way
on the first day it takes away all pain however great it may be and prevents swelling
on the second day it causes a sweat that is very viscous and thick that smells and tastes quite sour and offensive and occurs mostly where the joints and limbs are attached
on the third day regardless of whether any medicine has been taken a purging takes place of the veins into the bowels without any inconvenience pain or grief
and this demonstrates a great power of nature
against leprosy to begin with the patient is given six drops on an empty stomach
and arrange it so that the unclean person is alone without the company of any healthy people in a separate and convenient place
for his whole body will soon begin to smoke and steam with a stinking mist or vapor
and on the second day his skin will start to and much will detach itself from his body
he should then have three more drops of the medicine ready which he should take and use in solitude on the fourth day
then on the eighth or ninth day by means of this medicine and through the bestowal of divine mercy and blessing he will be completely cleansed and his health restored
against or stroke in the case of stroke let a drop of the tincture fall onto the tongue of the person in need
at once it will raise itself and distribute itself like a mist or smoke and and dissolve the struck part
but if the stroke has hit the body or other members he should be given three drops at the same time in a glass of good wine as previously taught in the case of
against or in the case of give one drop each day for six days in a row in or
on the seventh day give three drops in good wine
then it is enough
against
in case of the falling sickness give him two drops at the beginning of the in and after three hours again two drops
this will suffice
but if further symptoms should occur then give him two more drops as above
against hectic in case of consumption and dehydration give him two drops in the first day
on the second day give him two more drops in good wine
against fever in cases of all kinds of hot give him three drops in a well distilled st water or at the beginning of the
early in the morning on the following day again give him three drops in good wine on an empty stomach
against pest in the case of give the patient seven drops in a good wine and see to it that the infected person is all by himself and caused to sweat
then this poison will with divine assistance do him no harm
for the prolongation and maintenance of a healthy life
take and give at the beginning and entry of spring when the sun has entered the sign of two drops and at the beginning with gods help be safe and protected against bad health and poisoned air unless the incurred disease was predestined and fatally imposed upon man by the god
but we now wish to proceed to the and its power and show how this oil may also help the diseased and imperfect metallic bodies
take in the name of god very pure refined gold as much as you want and think will suffice
dissolve it in a wine prepared the way one usually makes aquam
and after the gold has become dissolved let it digest for a month
then put it into a and off the very slowly and gently
repeat this several times as long and as often until you see that your gold remains behind in as a sap
and such is the manner and opinion of several of the ancients on how this oil may also help the diseased and imperfect metallic bodies
take in the name of god very pure refined gold as much as you want and think will suffice
dissolve it in a wine prepared the way one usually makes aquam
and after the gold has become dissolved let it digest for a month
then put it into a and off the very slowly and gently
repeat this several times as long and as often until you see that your gold remains behind in as a sap
and such is the manner and opinion of several of the ancients on how to prepare the gold
but i will show and teach you a much shorter better and more useful way
 that you instead of such prepared gold take one part the preparation of which i have already taught in another place by its proper process
draw off its airy water so that it becomes a subtle dust and
then take two parts of our blessed oil and pour the oil very slowly drop by drop onto the dust of the until everything has become absorbed
put it in a well sealed into a heat of the first degree of the oven of secrets and let it remain there for ten days and nights
you will then see your powder and oil quite dry such that it has become a single piece of dust of a grey
after ten days give it the second degree of heat and the grey and black will slowly change into a whiteness so that it becomes more or less white
and at the end of these ten days the matter will take on a beautiful rose white
but this may be ignored
for this is only due to the that has swallowed up our blessed oil and now covers it with the innermost part of its body
but by the power of the fire our oil will again subdue such and throw it into its innermost
and the oil with its very bright red will rule over it and remain on the outside
therefore it is time when twenty years sic have passed that you open the window of the third degree the ovens had small openings at different heights by means of which the heat was regulated
the external white and force will then completely recede inwardly and the internal red will by the force of the fire become external
keep also this degree of fire for ten days without increase or decrease
you will then see your powder that was previously white now become very red
but for the time being this may be ignored is of no consequence for it is still unfixed and volatile and at the end of these ten days when the thirtieth day has passed you should open the last window of the fourth degree of fire let it stay in this degree for another ten days and this very bright red powder will begin to melt
let it stay in flux for these ten days
and when you take it out you will find on the bottom a very bright red and transparent stone colored melted into the shape of the
this stone may be used for projection as has been taught in the tract on vitriol
praise god in eternity for this his high revelation and thank him in eternity
amen
on the multiplication
the ancient sages after they had discovered this stone and prepared it to perfect power and translation of the imperfect metals to gold long sought to discover a way to increase the power and efficiency of this stone
and they found two ways to multiply it one is a multiplication of its power such that the stone may be brought much further in its power of transmutation
and this multiplication is very subtle the description of which may be found in the tract on gold
the second multiplication is an of the stone with its former power in such a way that it neither loses any of its power nor gains any but in such a manner that its weight increases and keeps on increasing ever more so that a single ounce grows and increases to many ounces
to achieve this increase or multiplication one has to proceed in the following manner take in the name of god your stone and grind it to a subtle powder and add as much as was taught before
put these together into a round seal with and put it into the former oven exactly as taught except that the time has to be shorter and less now
for where you previously used ten thirty days you may now not use more than four ten days
in other respects the work is exactly the same as before
praise and thank god the for his high revelation and diligently continue your prayers fir his mercy and divine blessings of this work and art as well as his granting you a good health and welfare
and moreover take care always to help and counsel the poor
in the month of i was invited by m aug professor of the college of to attend some of a medium receiving no compensation for her services and of whose extraordinary gifts and apparently supernormal faculties i had frequently heard
having gladly accepted the invitation of my worthy colleague i found the medium in question whom i shall call
to be a beautiful woman about thirty years of age tall vigorous of a fresh healthy complexion with hair and eyes almost black of an open and intelligent countenance which at once invoked sympathy
she evinced nothing of the emaciated or tragic aspect which one habitually ascribes to the of tradition but wore an air of health of physical and mental vigor very pleasant to behold and which is not often encountered in those who are good mediums
the number of those invited to take part in the being complete we seated ourselves in a circle with our hands resting upon the traditional round table of circles
 possesses a triple mediumship visual and began in the most natural manner to describe the various which passed before her eyes in the partially darkened room
suddenly she stops and listens she hears a name spoken in her ear which she repeats to us with astonishment then brief sentences the words of which are spelled out by on the table explain the meaning of the vision
speaking for myself alone there were three of us to divide the honor of the i was greatly surprised to recognize in scenes which passed before my eyes events which had transpired in my own family prior to my birth
whence could the medium whom i had never met before have derived the knowledge of events belonging to a remote past of a private nature and utterly unknown to any living person the astounding powers of mrs the famous medium whose wonderful intuition reads the latent memories of her visitors like an open book recurred to my mind and i went out from that with renewed hope of finding myself some day face to face with the true and genuine clairvoyance manifestations it matters not by what name it be called provided only that it be wholly out of the ordinary and that it succeed in utterly the entire framework of established science
i was able at this time to obtain general information only concerning the past of
but it was all of a character favorable to her and has since been fully confirmed
of modest bearing and an moral character she has for years earned an honorable living as an employe of a commercial house in which her industry her perseverance and her high character have combined to secure her a very responsible and important position
some three years prior to the date of my introduction to her she had been initiated into a group where her remarkable psychic powers almost immediately manifested themselves and she then became a member of various other circles
from its commencement her mediumship manifested the complex type to which i have already alluded and from which it has never deviated
visions in a waking state accompanied by and hallucinations alternately appeared
from the point of view of their content these messages had generally a bearing on past events usually unknown to the persons present but which were always verified by referring to biographical or to the traditions of the families interested
to these phenomena of or of were joined occasionally according to the environment moral exhortations communicated through the table more frequently in poetry than in prose addressed to the sitters medical consultations accompanied by prescriptions generally appropriate communications from parents or friends recently deceased or finally revelations as piquant as they were concerning the that is the previous of the sitters almost all of whom being profound believers in would not have been at all surprised to learn that they were the respectively of of of the princess or of other notable personages
it is necessary finally to add that all these messages seemed to be more or less bound up with the mysterious presence of a spirit answering to the name of who assumed to be the guide and of the medium
i at once undertook to improve my acquaintance with
she freely consented to give for my benefit alternating with a series which she was giving m and another for the benefit of prof of the society for psychic studies all of which i was permitted to attend
in this way i have been able to be present at the greater part of during the past five years
the personal observations that i have thus been able to make reinforced by notes on sittings which i was unable to attend kindly furnished me by mm
and form the basis of the study which follows to which must be added however certain letters of
as well as the numerous and very interesting conversations i have held with her either immediately preceding or following her or at her home where i also have had the advantage of being able to talk with her mother
finally various documents and accessory information which will be cited in their respective time and place have also been of assistance in enabling me partially to certain obscure points
notwithstanding all these sources of information however i am still very far from being able to disentangle and satisfactory explain the complex phenomena which constitute mediumship
dating from the period at which i made the acquaintance of
ie
from the winter of while most of her communications have continued to present he same character as to form and content as before a double and very important modification in her mediumship has been observed
 as to their psychological formwhile up to that time had experienced partial and limited with the preservation to a certain extent of the waking state and not involving noticeable loss of memory from that time and with increasing frequency she has been subject to an entire loss of consciousness and a failure to retain on returning to her normal state any recollection of what has transpired during the
in physiological terms the without which had been her up to that time and which the sitters mistook for the ordinary waking state was now transformed into total with consecutive
in parlance
now became completely entranced and having formerly been an ordinary visual and medium she now advanced to the higher plane of an medium
i fear that this change must in a great measure be attributed to my influence since it followed almost immediately upon my introduction to
or even if the total would have inevitably been eventually developed by virtue of an organic predisposition and of a tendency favorable to states it is nevertheless probable that i aided in hastening its appearance by my presence as well as by a few experiments which i permitted myself to make upon
as is well known mediums are usually surrounded by a halo of veneration which prevents any one from touching them during their trances the idea would never occur to any ordinary of circles to endeavor to ascertain the condition of the mediums sensory and motor functions by feeling her hands pinching the flesh or pricking the skin with a pin
silence and immobility are the strict rule in order not to the spontaneous production of the phenomena and a few questions or brief observations on the receipt of a message is all that is permissible by way of conversation and no one therefore would under ordinary circumstances dare to attempt any manipulation of the medium
had always been surrounded by this respectful consideration and during the first three i conformed myself strictly to the passive and purely contemplative attitude of the other sitters
but at the fourth sitting my discretion vanished
i could not resist a strong desire to ascertain the physiological condition of the charming and i made some vigorous elementary experiments upon her hands which lay temptingly spread out opposite me on the table
these experiments which i renewed and followed up at the succeeding demonstrated that there is present in
during her visions a large and varied assortment of sensory and motor disturbances which had hitherto escaped the notice of the sitters and which are thoroughly identical with those that may be observed in cases of hysteria where they are more permanent and those that may be momentarily produced in hypnotic subjects by suggestion
this was not at all astonishing and was to have been expected
but one consequence which i had not foreseen did occur when four days after my second experimental
fell completely asleep for the first time at a sitting with m at which i was not present
the sitters were somewhat frightened and in trying to awaken her discovered the rigidity of her arms which were considerably
however communicating by means of the table upon which she was leaning fully reassured them and gave them to understand that such sleep was not at all prejudicial to the medium
after assuming various attitudes and indulging in some amusing
awoke in excellent spirits retaining as a last recollection of her dream that of a kiss which had imprinted upon her forehead
from that day on were the rule with and the at which she did not fall completely asleep for at least a few moments formed rare exceptions to the course of events during the next four years
it is a great deprivation for
that these ordinarily leave her no memory upon her awakening of what has transpired in her trance and she longs for the of former times when the visions unfolded themselves before her eyes furnishing her with a pleasing spectacle which was always unexpected and which continually being renewed caused the to be to her a source of great delight
for the sitters on the other hand these scenes of and incarnation together with the various physiological phenomena of lethargy
which accompanied them added great variety and additional interest to remarkable and instructive triple mediumship
the greater sometimes implies the less simultaneously with the access of complete came new forms and innumerable shades of
the triple form of which distinguished the first years of
experiences has been wonderfully developed since and it would now be difficult to name any principal forms of psychic mediumship of which she has not furnished curious specimens
i shall have occasion to cite several of them in the course of this work
constitutes the most remarkable medium i have ever met and very nearly approaches the ideal of what might be called the or medium in contradistinction to the uniform mediums whose faculties only concern themselves with one kind of
 a modification analogous to that which took place in the form of the messages consisting of a marked improvement in their depth and importance was noticeable simultaneously in their content
alongside of the unimportant communications complete at one sitting and independent one of another which filled up a large part of each of and in no wise differentiated her faculties from those of the majority of mediums she manifested from the beginning a marked tendency
to a superior systematization and a more lofty chain of visions communications were often continued through several and reached their conclusion only at the end of several weeks
but from the period at which i made the acquaintance of
this tendency towards unity began to assert itself still more strongly
several long dreams began to appear and to develop the events of which continued to be unfolded through months even years and indeed still continue a species of romance of the imagination analogous to those continued stories which so many of our race tell themselves in their moments of far or at times when their routine occupations offer only slight obstacles to daydreaming and of which they themselves are generally the heroes
 has no fewer than three distinct romances and if to these is added the existence of that secondary personality to which i have already alluded and which reveals itself under the name of we find ourselves in the presence of four subconscious creations of vast extent which have been evolved on parallel lines for several years and which manifest themselves in irregular alternation during the course of different or often even in the same
all of these have undoubtedly a common origin in consciousness but in practice at least and to all appearance these imaginative constructions present a relative independence and a diversity of content sufficiently great to render it necessary to study them separately
i shall confine myself at present to a general view of them
two of these romances are connected with the idea of previous
it has indeed been revealed that has already lived twice before on this globe
five hundred years ago she was the daughter of an sheik and became under the name of the favorite wife of a prince named who reigned over and built in the year the fortress of
in the last century she reappeared in the person of the illustrious and unfortunate
again reincarnated as a punishment for her sins and the perfecting of her character in the humble circumstances of she in certain states recovers the memory of her glorious of old and becomes again for the moment princess or queen of
i will designate under the names of or oriental cycle and royal cycle the whole of the automatic manifestations relative to these two previous
i shall call the third romance the cycle in which
by virtue of the mediumistic faculties which are the appanage and the consolation of her present life has been able to enter into relation with the people and affairs of the planet mars and to their mysteries to us
it is in this astronomical that the phenomenon of appears which consists of the fabrication and the use of an unknown language and which is one of the principal objects of this study we shall see however that analogous facts are likewise presented in the cycle
the personality of maintains very complex relations with the preceding creations
on the one hand it is very closely connected with the royal cycle owing to the fact that the name of is only a pseudonym under which is concealed the illustrious who it appears was madly with queen and who now and floating in space has constituted himself the guardian angel in some respects of mile
in whom after a long search he has again found the august object of his unhappy passion of a century ago
on the other hand this of and spiritual guide which he assumes towards confers upon him a privileged place in her
he is more or less mixed up in the greater part of them assists at them watches over them and perhaps in a measure directs them
he also occasionally appears in the midst of a or a scene delivering his message by certain characteristic movements of the hand
to sum up sometimes revealing himself by upon the table the taps of a finger or by automatic writing sometimes himself completely and speaking by the mouth of
while in these the multiple and varied functions of giving good advice relative to the manner of acting towards the medium of hidden behind the scenes watching the performance and ready at any time to intervene of disposed interpreter willing to furnish explanations of all that is obscure of of morals sharply the sitters when he it necessary of sympathetic physician prompt at diagnosis and well versed in the
he also appears under his own name of to the gaze of the and answers her questions by means of hallucinations
nor is this all to make our summary complete it is necessary also to investigate the personal connection of
with her invisible
she often and questions at her own convenience and while he remains sometimes for weeks without giving any sign of life he at other times readily responds to her by means of voices or visions which surprise her while fully awake in the course of her daily duties and in which he upon her in turn material or moral advice useful information or the encouragement and consolation of which she has need
although i have accused myself of perhaps having had much to do with the transformation of into complete trances i believe myself however altogether innocent of the origin and therefore of the subsequent development of the great creations of which i have spoken
the first that of is of very early date even going back probably as we shall see prior to
initiation into
as to the three cycles they did not it is true commence to display their full amplitude until after i had made acquaintance and since they start from the time when she first became subject to veritable trances it would seem as though that supreme form of is the only one capable of allowing the full expansion of productions so complex and the only psychological container appropriate and adequate to such a content
but the first appearance of all three was clearly prior to my presence at the
the dream where i shall be found playing a which i did not seek evidently began eight weeks before my admission to
 the romance which dates from the same period is closely connected as i shall also show with an involuntary suggestion of m who made the acquaintance of in the spring of nine months before my introduction to her
the royal cycle finally had been roughly outlined at held at the home of m in
nevertheless i repeat only since have the exuberant growth and magnificent flowering of that vegetation taken place under the stimulating and provocative influence albeit wholly and altogether at the time of the varied environments of
 as far as the indiscreet revelations in regard to my own family which so much astonished me at my first meeting with
are concerned as well as the innumerable extraordinary facts of the same kind with which her mediumship abounds and to which she owes her immense reputation in circles it will suffice to return in the closing chapters of this book
the psychological history of
and her is naturally divided into two separate periods by the important fact of her initiation into at the beginning of
before that time not suspecting the possibility of voluntary communication with the world of spirits she naturally manifested nothing more than a few spontaneous phenomena the first of her mediumistic faculties which still lay dormant the exact nature and progress of which it would be interesting to know in detail unfortunately in the absence of written documents concerning that period we are confined to the statements of and her parents in regard to it and the untrustworthiness of the memory in connection with events of a remote past is only too well known
the period on the contrary extending over the last seven years and infinitely more fertile in artificially promoted eg
the as well as in spontaneous manifestations is much better known to us but in order to comprehend it intelligently it is necessary first to pass in review the few facts which we have been able to gather relating to the is to say the childhood and youth of
 that will be the subject of this chapter
 has lived in since her infancy
after attending school she entered as an apprentice at the age of fifteen a large commercial house where as i have already stated she still remains and where little by little she has risen to a very responsible position
her father a merchant was a and possessed a remarkable facility for languages which is of interest to us in presence of the phenomena of a subject which will be discussed hereafter
her mother is a
both enjoyed excellent health and attained a venerable old age
had a younger sister who died in early childhood and two brothers older than herself who are now fathers of families and established abroad where they have had successful business careers
i am not aware that m who was a man of positive character ever displayed any phenomena of
 however as well as her grandmother has experienced several thoroughly characteristic phenomena of that kind and one at least of brothers it appears could easily have become a good medium
this is another instance of the distinctly hereditary tendency of mediumistic faculties
m a man of active and enterprising character died quite suddenly probably of an at the age of years
he had left in his youth and finally established himself at after having travelled extensively in and where he remained for several years
he spoke fluently and understood fairly well and also knew and a little
it would seem that his daughter has inherited these linguistic aptitudes but only in a latent and manner for she has always detested the study of languages and rebelled against learning in which she took lessons for three years
 who is a woman with much good practical sense is years of age
neither she nor her husband was ever a nervous or psychopathic subject but both showed a marked tendency to affections of a somewhat alarming type
 has besides suffered frequently from rheumatism
does not appear to have inherited these tendencies she has always enjoyed health and has not even had the slight diseases usually incidental to childhood
although both m and
were through a chain of peculiar circumstances their daughter was baptized a shortly after her birth her name being inscribed some months later on the register of the church of
the memory of this unusual baptism has certainly not been lost by imagination and has duly contributed to the hypothesis of a mysterious origin
of the years of childhood i know nothing specially interesting
at the intermediate school at which she passed only a year and where i have consulted the records of her class she was not distinguished either for good or ill from the point of view of but she certainly did not reveal the full measure of her intelligence since she failed to pass the examinations at the end of the year a fact which decided her entrance upon an apprenticeship
on the other hand the worthy pastor who gave her religious instruction somewhat later and who has never lost sight of her since has furnished me with most testimonials as to her character he remembers her as a young girl of serious disposition intelligent thoughtful faithful in the discharge of her duties and devoted to her family
m never showed the least trace of mediumistic phenomena from having been very indifferent or even hostile to until his daughter began to interest herself in it he finally succumbed to her influence and became a believer in that doctrine towards the close of his life
 on the contrary has always been predisposed to it and has experienced several phenomena of that nature in the course of her life
at the period of the epidemic of which raged in our country about the middle of this century she too experimented quite successfully for a while upon the table with her friends and
later she had some sporadic visions
the following is one of the most typical
while her little daughter three years old was ill
awoke in the middle of the night and saw an angel of dazzling brightness standing by the side of the little bed with its hands stretched out above the child after some moments the apparition gradually dissolved
 awakened her husband and told him of the fatal significance which she attached to the vision but he unable to see anything ridiculed her superstitious fears
as a matter of fact the child died on the following day to the great surprise of the physician attending her
this is a fine example of true maternal subconsciously felt and transferring itself into the normal consciousness by a visual which borrowed for its symbolic content an appropriate popular image
 never knew her mother who died shortly after her birth but she recalls and has related to me some characteristic visions of her grandmother who brought her up various phenomena connected with one of brothers hearing of steps in the night
have proved to her that one of her sons at least is a medium
was certainly predisposed both by heredity and temperament to become a medium as soon as the outward is the suggestions of present itself
it is evident indeed from her recital of events that she was more or less from her infancy
it does not appear however that she ever manifested phenomena capable in themselves of attracting the attention of her family
i have not been able to discover any indication whatever of crises or attacks of an abnormal nature not even of
her have been always almost entirely con fined to the sensory or mental sphere and it is only from her own narratives that other people have any knowledge of them
they assume the double form of more or less conscious and of hallucinations properly so called
 reveriesthe habit of falling into reverie of building castles in the air of transporting ones self into other conditions of existence or of telling ones self stories in which one plays the chief is more frequent among women than among men and in childhood and youth than in mature years
this seems to have always been extremely marked in the case of
since from her schoolgirl days she has shown herself to be of a sedentary and domestic temperament preferring the quiet companionship of her mother to the games of her comrades and her to outdoor
the fragments which have survived in conscious memory are all that is known to us of the content of these but it nevertheless to reveal to us the general tone of her and to show us that the images suddenly surging up before her mental vision had a peculiar often very fantastic character and which enables us to see in them the beginnings of her later great romances
it is to be noticed also that the designs embroideries varied artistic works which were always the favorite occupations of her moments of leisure and in which she excels were almost always from her infancy not copies of exterior models but the products of her own invention marked with the bizarre and original stamp of her internal images
moreover these pieces of work grew under her fingers with an ease and rapidity that astonished herself
they made themselves as it were
she was always fond of indulging in and recalls many a passed motionless in an on which occasions she was accustomed to see all kinds of strange things but being of a very nature she seldom mentioned them to her parents for fear of not being understood
she used to see highly colored landscapes a lion of stone with a mutilated head fanciful objects on
she does not remember the details but does clearly recollect that they all bore a close resemblance to her and visions of later years
these also appeared to her in the night
she remembers among other things to have seen when about fourteen or fifteen years old a bright light thrown against the wall of her room which then seemed to be filled with strange and unknown beings
she had the impression of being fully awake but it suddenly occurred to her that she must have been dreaming and it was only then that she comprehended that it was really a vision which she had experienced
 hallucinationsin the foregoing examples it would be difficult to say to exactly which category the facts belong especially the nocturnal phenomena and one may hesitate whether to regard them as simple dreams of a very vivid character or visions or as veritable hallucinations
on the other hand we undoubtedly have the right to give the latter designation to the numerous which
has when in full possession of her senses in the daytime
one day for example as she was playing with a friend she saw some one following her and mentioned the fact to her companion who could not see any one
the imaginary individual after having followed her around a tree for a moment disappeared and she was unable to find him again
of an entirely different order are the strange characters which she remembers having sometimes involuntarily substituted for letters when writing to her friends which must be regarded as hallucinations
these were undoubtedly the same characters which at other times appeared to her in visual images
this was the prelude to the phenomenon so frequently experienced by her in the last few years and of which we shall hereafter see many automatic writing mingling with her ordinary in her waking state
alongside of hallucinations like these which do not show any intentional or useful character and are only a capricious and into the normal consciousness mere dreams or fancies filling up the subconscious strata there are also manifested in case some hallucinations of a manifest utility which have in consequence the sense of messages addressed by the consciousness of the subject to her normal consciousness by way of warning and protection
it is to be noted that these hallucinations which might be called teleological have lately been claimed by although he has no recollection of and does not assert himself to be the author of the earlier ones
the following is a curious example at about the age of seventeen or eighteen was returning from the country one evening carrying a fine bouquet of flowers
during the last minutes of the journey she heard behind her a peculiar cry of a bird which seemed to her to warn her against some danger and she hastened her steps without looking behind
on her arrival at home the cry followed her into her room without her having been able to see the creature from which it emanated
she went tired to bed and in the middle of the night awoke in great pain but was unable to cry out
at that moment she felt herself gently lifted together with the pillow on which she lay as if by two friendly hands which enabled her to recover her voice and call her mother who hastened to comfort her and carried the flowers which were too out of the room
on being recently during a of as to this incident coming up again after so many years has a very clear recollection of it and gives the following explanation
it was not really the cry of a bird but it was he who caused to hear a sort of whistle hoping thereby to attract her attention to the danger lurking in the bouquet of flowers in which was a great deal of of powerful odor
unfortunately did not understand and retained the bouquet in her room
he adds that his failure to give a more clear and intelligible warning was due to the fact that it was at that time impossible for him to do so
the whistle which took for the cry of a bird was all that it was in his power to utter
it was again he who intervened at the moment of her nocturnal illness by raising her head in order to enable her to call for help
i have no reason to doubt the substantial accuracy either of the account given by and her mother or of the explanation recently furnished by
the incident belongs to the category of wellknown cases where a danger of some sort not suspected by the normal personality but which is subconsciously known or recognized is off by a either sensory as cry of the bird or motor as in the lifting of the body
the consciousness is not always able to give a clear message in the present case the remained in a state of elementary a simple whistle without being able to it to a distinct verbal
its general warning sense however was understood by thanks to the confused feeling of danger that she felt at the same time
moreover this confused feeling which caused her to quicken her steps it seems to me ought not to be considered as the consequence of the whistle she heard but rather as a parallel phenomenon the appearance or the odor of the mint she was carrying while not attracting her conscious attention nevertheless dimly roused in her an idea of the danger lurking in the flowers and that idea in turn affected her clear consciousness under the double form of a vague emotion of danger and a translation which did not go so far as to formulate itself explicitly
under circumstances of a nature calculated to cause a strong emotional shock and especially when the psychic sphere which involves the sentiment of modesty is strongly acted upon has a visual of a man clothed in a long brown robe with a white cross on his breast like a monk who comes to her aid and accompanies her in silence as long as the necessity for his presence continues
this unknown always silent each time appearing and disappearing in a sudden and mysterious manner is no other than himself according to the recent affirmations of the latter
we should naturally expect that would have had in her youth many striking experiences of prevision intuition divination
which are among the most diffuse forms of teleological
such however does not seem to have been the fact neither she nor her mother has recounted to me anything remarkable of this nature and they confine themselves to a general affirmation of frequent which were subsequently justified as to the persons and events with which they were connected
all the examples which i have above cited concur in bringing to light the strong penchant of
towards
but from the point of view of their meaning there is a notable difference between the teleological phenomena or hallucinations of a manifest utility and those which have and other perturbations which are altogether superfluous if not actually detrimental to normal personality
there are dreams and other absolutely useless which have insinuated themselves without rhyme or reason into normal life
one does not know how or in what manner to interpret these phenomena capricious and as they seem to be and they remain isolated inconsiderable facts without bearing and without interest since they can not be attached to any central principle to one or fundamental emotion
we are therefore reduced to certain conjectures the most reasonable of which is that these diverse fragments make part of some vast subconscious creation in which all the being of
crushed and bruised by the conditions which the realities of life have imposed upon her as is more or less the case with each one of us gave free wing to the deep aspirations of its nature and expanded into the fiction of an existence more brilliant than her own
all that we know of character both as a child and as a young girl shows us that her dominant emotional note was a sort of instinctive inward revolt against the modest environment in which it was her lot to be born a profound feeling of dread and opposition of inexplicable malaise of bitter antagonism against the whole of her material and intellectual environment
while showing herself always very devoted to her parents and brothers she had only feeble natural affinities for them
she felt like a stranger in her family and as one away from home
she had a feeling of isolation of abandonment of exile which created a sort of gulf between her and her family
so strong were these feelings that she actually one day seriously asked her parents if it was absolutely certain that she was their daughter or whether it was not possible that the nurse might some day by mistake have brought home another child from the daily walk
this want of adaptation to her environment this sort of mysterious homesickness for an unknown country shows itself in a characteristic manner in the following fragment of narrative in which who has always attributed great importance to dreams tells of one in which an isolated house figured
to me this retired mansion in which i lived alone isolated represents my life which from my infancy has been neither happy nor gay
even while very young i do not remember to have shared any of the tastes or any of the ideas of the members of my family
thus during the whole of my childhood i was left in what i call a profound isolation of heart and in spite of all in spite of this complete want of sympathy i could not make up my mind to marry although i had several opportunities
a voice was always saying do not hurry the time has not arrived this is not the destiny for which you are reserved
and i have listened to that voice which has absolutely nothing to do with conscience and i do not regret it for since i have engaged in i have found myself so surrounded with sympathy and friendships that i have somewhat forgotten my sad lot
this quotation speaks volumes in regard to the turn of mind and the emotional disposition which ruled as a little girl
it is surely so to speak the vulgar story and the common lot of all many a child many a youth many an unrecognized genius feel themselves suffocating in their too narrow environment when the latent energies of life begin to ferment
but there are differences in kind and in degree
with
the sentiment of not having been made for her environment and of belonging by nature to a higher sphere was intense and lasting
her mother always had the impression that was not happy and wondered that she was so serious so absorbed so wanting in the exuberance of spirits natural to her age
her father and her brothers not comprehending the real reasons for this absence of gayety taxed her very with pride and and accused her sometimes of her humble surroundings
there are shades of feeling which can only be understood when they have been experienced
well knew that she really had no contempt for her material and social environment which on the contrary inspired her with respect but which simply was not congenial to her nature and temperament
to this fundamental feeling of imprisonment in a too sphere was joined in case a timid disposition
darkness the least noise the creaking of the furniture made her tremble by day a person walking behind her an unexpected movement the ringing of the doorbell gave her the impression that some one wishing to harm her had come to seize her and carry her off
on the whole tendency to be startled by everything and nothing constituted with her a grievous a state of fear and insecurity which greatly strengthened her impression of want of an environment to which she was decidedly superior
it is easy now to see the connection between that depressing emotionalism which was the attribute of childhood and the slightly tone of her later romances
the idea intrudes itself that in spite by reason apparent contrast these two traits are not independent of each other but bound by the tie of cause and effect
but this causal connection is in great danger of being interpreted in a precisely inverse sense by the empirical psychologist and the metaphysical
the latter will explain
curious impression of strangeness and superiority to the base conditions of her actual existence by her illustrious previous the psychologist on the contrary will see in that sane impression the wholly natural origin of her grandiose
in default of a complete understanding always dubious between these so different points of view of which we shall speak later it will be advisable to adopt at least a provisional modus based on the of the native constitution or individual character of
 on the farther side of that wall in eternity so to speak a ante which precedes the arrival of into this life the will have full latitude to imagine such a succession of as it shall please him in order to explain the character she has had from her infancy
but on this side of the is to say within the limits of her present psychologist will have the right to ignore all these and taking for his point of departure the innate constitution of without troubling himself about anything she may have received by the accidents of heredity or preserved from her royal he will endeavor to explain by that same constitution as it reveals itself in her daily life the genesis of her creations under the action of occasional exterior influences
the then can have the pleasure of regarding
characteristic trait as a child that impression of solitude and wandering about in a world for which she was not made as the effect of her real past while the psychologist will be permitted to see in it the cause of her future dreams of grandeur
the emotional disposition which i have depicted and which is one of the forms under which the of the organism physical and mental to the hard conditions of the environment betrays itself seems therefore to me to have been the source and for all the of in her childhood
thence came these visions always warm luminous highly colored exotic bizarre and these brilliant superbly dressed in which her antipathy for her insipid and unpleasant surroundings betrays itself her weariness of ordinary commonplace people her disgust for prosaic occupations for vulgar and disagreeable things for the narrow house the dirty streets the cold winters and the gray sky
whether these images very diverse but of the same brilliant quality were already existent in subconscious thought while still a child or a young girl we are unable to say
it is however probable that their systematization was far from attaining to such a degree of perfection as they have presented during the past few years under the influence of
all the facts of to which can assign a vaguely approximate date group themselves around her fifteenth year and are all included between the limits of her ninth and twentieth years
this evident connection with a phase of development of major importance has been confirmed to me by on various occasions who says that he appeared to for the first time in her tenth year on an exceptional occasion of extreme fright but after that not until about four years later because the physiological conditions necessary to his apparition were not yet realized
the moment they were realized he says he began to manifest himself and it is at the same period according to him that commenced to recover memories of her existence under the form of strange visions of which she comprehended neither the nature nor the origin
after the age of about twenty years without affirming or believing that her visions and ceased altogether
has no striking recollections of any and she has not told me of any psychic phenomenon experienced by her in the series of years immediately preceding her entrance into
we may infer from this with some reason that the of the imaginative subconscious life gradually became calm after the explosion of the period we have mentioned
they had been appeased
the conflict between inner nature and the environment in which she was forced to live became less fierce
a certain equilibrium was established between the necessities of practical life and her inward aspirations
on the one hand she resigned herself to the necessities of reality and if her native pride could not yield to the point of condescending to a marriage honorable undoubtedly but for which she felt she was not intended we must nevertheless pay homage to the perseverance the fidelity the devotion which she always brought to the of her family and business duties
on the other hand she did not permit the flame of the ideal to be extinguished in her and it reacted upon her environment as strongly as possible making its imprint upon her personality well marked
she introduced a certain stamp of elegance into the modest home of her parents
she arranged for herself a small salon and comfortable in its simplicity
she took lessons in music and bought herself a piano
she hung some old engravings on her walls secured some vases a filled with plants cut flowers in pretty vases a hanging lamp with a beautiful shade of her own make a which she had put together and embroidered herself some photographs curiously framed according to her own design and out of this harmonious whole always beautifully kept she evolved something original bizarre and delightful well to the general character of her fantastic
at the same time that
succeeded in accommodating herself to the conditions of her existence the state of latent timidity in which she lived gradually diminished
she is still occasionally overcome by fear but much less frequently than formerly and never without a legitimate exterior cause
indeed judging her by these latter years i do not recognize in her the child or young girl of former days always timid trembling and frightened and morose who has been depicted to me by herself and her mother
it seems to me then that the wildness of the dreams and which were symptoms of a tendency to mental disintegration which marked the years of puberty was succeeded by a progressive diminution of these troubles and a gradual gaining of wisdom on the part of the strata
we may presume that this harmonization this reciprocal adaptation of the internal to the external would in time have perfected itself and that the whole personality of
would have continued to consolidate and unify itself if had not come all of a sudden to the fire which still slumbered under the ashes and to give a new start to the mechanism which was beginning to grow rusty
the suppressed aroused themselves the of former years resumed their sway and the images of phantasy began to be more prolific than ever under the fertile suggestions of philosophy or of as the idea of former and which they had only to group and organize themselves in order to give birth to the vast constructions the development of which we shall be obliged to follow
having endeavored in the preceding chapter to reconstruct in its chief characteristics the history of
up to the time when begins to be mixed up with it i would have preferred in the present chapter to make a detailed study of her psychological life during these last years without however as yet touching upon the content properly so called of her
not having been able to accomplish this design to my satisfaction for want of time and patience i shall endeavor at least to my notes somewhat by grouping them under four heads
i shall trace the birth of mediumship as far as it is possible for me to do so from the accounts i have been able to procure concerning a time at which i was not acquainted with her
then passing to facts with which i am more familiar i will describe rapidly her normal state as i have been able to see it for the last five years
this would have been the place for a study of individual psychology but i have been compelled to abandon the idea on account of multiple difficulties
finally i will offer a few remarks on the abnormal side of her existence which it is convenient to divide into two groups namely the is to say springing up of themselves in the course of her ordinary life or those provoked by the voluntary seeking for favorable circumstances and which constitute the properly so called
i the mediumistic beginnings of
in the winter of
heard spoken of by one of her
y who lent her book la
the perusal of this work having vividly excited curiosity
y agreed to accompany her to her friend
z who was interested in the same questions and who produced automatic writing
they then decided to form a circle for regular experimentation
i take from the notes which
z has had the kindness to furnish me the account unfortunately very brief of the at which mediumistic faculties first made their appearance
it was on the of that i made the acquaintance of
 she was introduced to me by
y for the purpose of endeavoring to form a group
she was then altogether a novice in never having attempted anything and did not suspect the faculties that have since developed themselves in her
first reunion we seat ourselves at the table we succeed in making it
we regard
y as the medium upon whom we can reckon
we try for writing
we receive through me to proceed
progress the table moves itself considerably one by one all the members of the group and gives us certain names of which only one is recognized

writing
who tries for the first time writes mechanically her eyes closed some phrases of which we can some words
march nothing at this except a communication written by myself
march progress clear communication by the table
attempt to experiment in the darkness which was not absolute the hall outside having some incandescent lights which diffused a feeble light we could distinguish each other with difficulty
 sees a balloon now luminous now becoming dark she has seen nothing up to this time
writing
writes mechanically a quite long communication from the father of m k a student present at the advice to him
at this point the sitters became so numerous that they broke up into two groups of which the one continuing to meet with
z does not concern us
 became a member of the other which met at the house of a lady named n where weekly were held for a year and a half up to the end of
the records of these meetings kept by
n are unfortunately very brief and obscure on many points of interest to the psychologist
those of the first months are in the handwriting of
who acted as secretary of the group for thirty
as she only took down at the time the headings of the communications of the spirits and wrote out the remainder on the following day we can not rely very strongly on the objective accuracy of these accounts which however have the advantage of presenting to us the mediumship of as related by herself
she speaks of herself in the third person
the following is a summary of the two first held in this new environment march eleven persons around a large and heavy of oak with two leaves
the table is set in motion and several spirits come and give their names by and testify to the pleasure it gives them to find themselves among us
it is at this that
begins to distinguish vague with long white moving from the floor to the ceiling and then a magnificent star which in the darkness appears to her alone throughout the whole of the
we from this that she will end by seeing things more distinctly and will possess the gift of clairvoyance
april violent movements of the table due to a spirit who calls himself and announces himself as the spiritual guide of the group
then he gives way to another spirit who says he is victor and the guide and of
who is very much surprised to be assisted by a person of such importance
he soon disappears
 is very much agitated she has fits of shivering is very cold
she is very restless and sees suddenly balancing itself above the table a grinning very face with long red hair
she is so frightened that she demands that the lights be lit
she is calmed and reassured
the figure disappears
afterwards she sees a magnificent bouquet of roses of different hues being placed on the table before one of the sitters m p all at once she sees a small snake come out from underneath the bouquet which crawling quickly perceives the flowers looks at them tries to reach the hand of m p for an instant comes back slowly and disappears in the interior of the bouquet
then all is dissolved and three are given on the table terminating the
m p interprets the meaning of the vision of the bouquet and the serpent as a symbolic translation of an emotional impression experienced by
 such was the birth of mediumship
scarcely anything happened on the of when the movements of the table were not attributed to her although in all probability she caused them in the following she appeared in two attempts at automatic writing unfortunately lost in imitation of the writing medium with whom she was sitting
the outcome of this second attempt leads us to suppose that faculties would have developed rapidly in that direction if she had not abandoned it and changed her environment
her visual faculty suggested by the experiments at obscure shows itself on the and of march in the form of elementary hallucinations or vague figures having their point of departure probably in the simple phenomena the own light consecutive images
then encouraged by the predictions of the sitters she attained on the of april to visions properly so called having a varied content and a real or symbolic
at the same time her was perfecting itself
we recognize it in the name of victor coming especially for
and suspect it to have been a name already given at the second
hallucinations follow closely upon the visual but it is impossible to know at just what date as the records do not clearly indicate whether the messages recorded had that origin or were rapped out on the table
to these known forms of must be added the frequent phenomena of emotion sadness restlessness fear
which are experienced by without knowing why and are afterwards found to be in perfect conformity to and in evident connection with the content of those emotional phenomena which they generally precede by a few moments
thus in a weekly the mediumship of
was invested with a complex psychological aspect which from that time it preserved intact for three years and of which i was a witness after i made her acquaintance
this rapidity of development is not at all unusual but there is this peculiarity about that her mediumistic faculties after their first appearance remained for a long time stationary and then underwent all at once in the spring of the enormous transformation and tremendous expansion which i have described in the first chapter and to which i will not again refer

in her normal state i was about to say that in her normal state
is normal
certain restrain me and i correct myself by saying that in her ordinary state she seems just like anybody else
by this i mean that outside of the gaps which the and the spontaneous of make in her life no one would suspect observing her performance of her various duties or in talking with her on all sorts of subjects all that she is capable of in her abnormal states or the curious treasures which are concealed in her strata
with a healthy and ruddy complexion of good height well of regular and harmonious features she breathes health in everything
she presents no visible of degeneration
as to psychic defects or anomalies with the exception of her mediumship itself i know of none the timidity of her youth having entirely disappeared
her physical strength is as shown by the fact that she bears up under the strain of a business which demands nearly eleven hours of her time each day nearly all of which she is compelled to stand on her feet and from which she takes only one weeks vacation in summer
besides this confining work away from home she assists her mother about the house morning and evening in the housekeeping duties and finds time besides to read a little to at her piano and to make the lovely handiwork which she designs and herself with remarkable originality and good taste
to a life so full must be added besides the which she is generally willing to give on and sometimes on a weekday evening very to persons who are interested in psychic questions or who desire to consult on important subjects
while hesitating to affirm that a person presenting phenomena so extraordinary as those of mediumship is perfectly normal in other respects i am pleased to discover that as far as
is concerned through my conversations with her and as the result of my investigations concerning her she does not present a single physical intellectual or moral between the periods of the irruptions of her
her field of vision which she has permitted me to measure with a perimeter is normal for white as well as for colors for which latter she has a very delicate perception
there is no trace of tactile in her hands
there is no known motor trouble
the tremor of the gives a line of four per second on an average differing not at all from the lines obtained from persons perfectly normal see fig
 it can not be expected that i should paint a full moral and intellectual portrait of
as i should be in danger of hurting her feelings in case my attempt should come to her notice
i can only touch on a few points
one of the most striking is her great native dignity her bearing her manners her language are always perfect and have a certain quality of noblesse and pride which accords well with her
on occasion she shows a stately and regal
she is very and feels little things very keenly
her as well as her sympathies are quick lively and tenacious
she is energetic and
she knows very well what she wants and nothing passes her by unperceived nor does she forget anything in the conduct of others towards her
i see everything nothing escapes me and i forgive but never forget she has often said to me
perhaps a severe moralist would find in her a certain exaggeration of personal sensibility but that sort of is a very common characteristic of human nature and is very natural in mediums who are continually exposed to public criticism
she is very intelligent and highly gifted
in conversation she shows herself vivacious sprightly and sometimes sarcastic
psychic problems and all questions connected with mediumistic phenomena of which she is herself so striking an example occupy her mind a great deal and form the principal subject of her private thoughts and of her conversations with people in whom she is interested
her philosophical views are not wanting in originality or breadth
she does not believe in in the generally accepted sense of the term and has never consented in spite of the advances which have been made to her to become a member of the society for psychic studies because as she says she has no fixed ideas on subjects so obscure does not care for theories and does not work in the interest of any party
she investigates she observes she reflects and discusses having adopted for her motto the truth in all things for all things and always
there are two points in regard to which she is the objective reality of and the supernormal content of her
no one dares tell her that her great invisible is only an illusory apparition another part of herself a product of her subconscious imagination nor that the strange peculiarities of her mediumistic the recognizable signatures of deceased persons the thousand correct revelations of facts unknown to but old forgotten memories of things which she saw or heard in her childhood
such suppositions being contrary to her beliefs and seemingly false in fact easily her as being in defiance of good sense and an outrage on truth
but outside of these two subjects she will examine and discuss coolly any hypothesis one chooses
the idea that she should be the of a princess or of that is really that the visions called are really from the planet mars
all seem to her to conform fully to the facts but these beliefs are not indispensable to her and she is ready should they prove to be false to change to other for example telepathy a mixture of influences a mysterious meeting in her of intuitions coming from some higher sphere
undoubtedly the of her in and on the throne of seems to her to explain in a plausible manner the feeling which has followed her from childhood of belonging to a world higher than that in which the chance of birth has imprisoned her for this life but she does not affirm a positive belief in that brilliant past is not wholly convinced of it and remains in a sensible state of expectancy of the true explanation of these ultimate mysteries of her life
there is another subject also which is close to her heart
she has heard it said that in the eyes of scientists and physicians mediums are considered to be fools hysterical subjects or insane or in any event abnormal in the bad sense of the word
but in the light of the experience of every day of her life she protests vigorously against this odious insinuation
she declares emphatically that she is perfectly sane in body and mind not in the least unbalanced and repels with indignation the idea there can be any serious or the least danger in mediumship such as she
i am far from being abnormal she wrote me recently and i have never been so clear of vision so lucid and so apt to judge correctly as since i have begun to develop as a medium
too speaking through her voice during her trances has more than once solemnly testified as to her perfect health
he has also returned to the subject by letter we shall find farther on a very interesting certificate of mental equilibrium dictated by him and written by him with her hand as if to give more weight to his declarations see fig
p
it is incontestable that has a very brain as is evidenced by the admirable manner in which she manages the important and complicated department which is under her direction in the commercial establishment in which she is employed
to accuse her of being insane simply because she is a medium as some charitable souls the world is full of them do not hesitate to do sometimes is to say the least a most
the opinion which
holds in her normal state concerning her automatic faculties is altogether optimistic and there is nothing to prove her in the wrong
she regards her mediumship as a rare and precious privilege with which nothing in the world would induce her to part
true she also sees in it the reason for the malevolent and unjust judgments the jealousies the base suspicions to which the ignorant multitude have in all ages subjected those who have succeeded in themselves above it through the possession of faculties of this kind
but on the whole the disadvantages are more than counterbalanced by gains of a high order and the inward satisfaction attached to such a gift
and here i desire to emphasize the statement once for all that does not belong to the class of professional mediums nor to those who use their mediumship for the purpose of money
 who earns her living in the position which her intelligence and fitness have secured for her and through which her family enjoys a modest ease never accepts any compensation for her or consultations
such a traffic in faculties which have a sort of religious in her eyes would be absolutely repugnant to her feelings
spontaneous have often aided her in without ever having interfered with her daily occupations
there is happily for her a great difference in intensity between the phenomena of her and those which break in upon her habitual existence the latter never having caused such disturbance of her personality as the former
in her daily life she has only passing hallucinations limited to one or two of the senses superficial compatible with a certain amount of short ephemeral perturbations of no importance from a practical point of view
taken as a whole the of the in her ordinary existence are more beneficial to her than otherwise since they often bear the stamp of utility and appropriateness which make them very serviceable
phenomena of divination lost objects mysteriously recovered happy inspirations true correct a word teleological of every possesses in so high a degree that this small coin of genius is more than sufficient to compensate for the resulting from the distraction and momentary absence of mind with which the vision is accompanied
in the on the contrary she presents the most grave functional alterations that one can imagine and passes through accesses of lethargy total change of personality
the least of which would be a very disagreeable adventure for her if it should happen to occur in the street or at her office
but here i am obliged to leave ordinary state to enter upon the study of her
 spontaneous automatic phenomena the which occur outside the in
everyday life those at least which she is able to recall and are of a frequency very variable and utterly independent of any known circumstances sometimes presenting themselves two or three times in the same day at others two or three weeks will elapse without a single one
extremely diverse in their form and content these phenomena may be divided into three categories based upon their origin
the first proceed from impressions received by in moments of special suggestibility the second are the above the ordinary level of her consciousness the romances in process of elaboration to which we are coming the last which differ from the two preceding species which are always useless if not detrimental by their beneficial character and their adaptation to the needs of the moment are roused by those teleological to which i have already called attention as having occurred in her childhood and which have shared in the general of her subconscious life under the lash of the experiences
let us pass these different cases rapidly in review
i permanence of exterior suggestionsthe reunions are naturally their principal source
i do not mean that she has there been subjected to experiments in suggestion
justice to all those who have attended the compels the statement that they have never abused the suggestibility which she shows on such occasions by suggesting ideas of such a nature as to cause her annoyance on the following days
the most that has been attempted has been the suggestion of some small matters by way of harmless experiment to be executed by her a few moments after from her trance
there is no need of intentional suggestions to influence her in a lasting manner therefore we have avoided as far as possible everything that might leave disagreeable traces behind and have suggested to her before the end of the that she have on the morrow no headache fatigue
but it sometimes happens that certain incidents often absolutely insignificant are engraved on her memory in a most manner and assail her as inexplicable obsessions during the ensuing week
the following are some specimens of involuntary suggestion which generally linger for three or four days but may occasionally continue for twelve or fifteen
told me one that she had been possessed several times during the day by the image of a straw hat the inside of which was turned towards her remained vertically in the air about three or four feet in front of her without being held by any one
she had the feeling that this hat belonged to me and i happened finally to recollect that at the of the preceding i happened to fan myself with this very hat during her final trance the image of which had been engraved on her mind in one of the flashes in which she opened her eyes and closed them again instantly before her final
this obsession said she was very strong on and the following day or two but lessened somewhat towards the end of the week
at another time she preserved during a whole week the sensation of the pressure of my thumb on her left eyebrow
compression of the external frontal and nerves is a means i often employ to hasten her after a hint given by
there happened to her also twice in the same day an and visual of an aged person whom she did not recognize but the extremely characteristic description of whom corresponds so well with that of a gentleman of who had been mentioned to her a few days previously immediately before the commencement of a when she was probably already in her state of suggestibility that there is scarcely any doubt but that these were the consequence of that conversation
following another where she had at the beginning of a scene made vain efforts to detach a bracelet from her left wrist she preserved for three days the feeling of something grasping that wrist without understanding what it could be
in the same way various feelings of sadness anger a desire to laugh or to weep
the cause of which she was unable to explain have often followed her for a considerable length of time after the of which these feelings were the manifest emotional echo
this is often the effect of our dreams on our waking state we forget the dreams but their influence remains and is often more marked in the dreams of a hypnotized person or a than in those of ordinary sleep
the are not the exclusive source of the involuntary suggestions which trouble
in her daily life without any benefit to herself
it is evident that on every occasion when she finds herself in that particular condition of least resistance which we in our ignorance of its intrinsic nature designate by the convenient name of suggestibility she is exposed to impressions capable of returning to assail her in the course of her daily occupations
fortunately this condition of suggestibility does not seem to develop itself readily in her outside of the reunions
 irruptions of reveriesi shall have too many occasions to cite concrete examples of visions voices and other spontaneous of the work of imagination which are continually going on under the ordinary consciousness of
to dwell long on this point
some general remarks will suffice
the connection which the unforeseen phenomena maintain with those of the themselves is very varied
sometimes we are able to recognize them as reproductions more or less incomplete of episodes which occurred at the preceding and consider them simple echoes or repetitions of these last
sometimes on the contrary it appears that we have to deal with preparatory rehearsals of scenes which will unfold themselves at length and will be continued at some later
finally sometimes it is a question of having no connection with those which fill up the they are like leaves flying away never to return romances which are continually being fabricated in the deep strata of
consciousness
in fact does not long remember nor in much detail with a few exceptions those visions which take place in her ordinary state and which occur most frequently early in the morning while she is still in bed or just after she has arisen and while working by the light of her lamp sometimes in the evening or during the brief moments of rest in the middle of the day and much more rarely while in the full activity of waking hours she is at her desk
if she had not long since at my request and with great good will acquired the habit of noting in pencil the essential content of these either during the apparition itself which she is not always able to do or else immediately afterwards we should have still more deficiencies in the plot of her romances to deplore
psychological state during her spontaneous visions is known to me only by her own descriptions
she is fortunately a very intelligent observer and a good psychologist
her narratives show that her visions are accompanied by a certain degree of
for a few moments for instance the room the light of the lamp disappear from before her eyes the noise of the wheels in the street ceases to be heard she feels herself becoming inert and passive while a feeling of bliss and ecstatic wellbeing permeates her entire individuality in the presence of the spectacle which appears to her then the vision to her great regret slowly from her view the lamp and the furniture reappear the outside noises again make themselves heard and she is astonished that the idea did not occur to her to put down in pencil the strange words she has heard or that she did not touch or caress for example the beautiful birds of flying and singing around her
sometimes she has maintained sufficient presence of mind to from the words striking her ear but the wretched handwriting proves that her attention all absorbed by the apparition could not follow the pencil and that the hand directed it badly
at other times the reverse is the fact
it appears in the course of the vision as though some one took hold of her arm and guided it in spite of herself the result is splendid wholly different from her own handwriting executed without her knowledge and during the execution of which her mind was wholly absent if we can judge from the surprise she shows on when she finds before her these strange writings and from analogous scenes which at the
the preceding is applicable especially to the more frequent is to the morning or evening visions which happen to her at home in that intermediate condition between sleep and waking always so favorable as we know to the development of unconscious
but there are innumerable shades and gradations between this middle type so to speak and its opposite extremes on the one hand is the fortunately very exceptional case where she is seized with ecstasy while at her place of business and on the other hand that in which the limits itself to some unknown characters or words in another hand than her own in her correspondence and which she is not slow to perceive on coming to herself
the following is an example of a case of ecstasy having ascended one day to an upper story to look for something in a dark storeroom she had an apparition of a man in a turban and large white cloak whom she had the impression of recognizing and whose presence filled her with a delightful calm and profound happiness
she could not recall the conversation which passed between them which though in an unknown language she nevertheless had the feeling of having perfectly comprehended
on the departure of the mysterious visitor she was astonished to find herself brought back to sombre reality and on noting by her watch that the interview had lasted much longer than it had seemed to do
she preserved all that day a delicious feeling of wellbeing as the effect of the strange apparition
the phenomenon of mingling strange writing with her own is of relatively frequent occurrence and we shall see divers specimens of it in the following chapters of the romances to which it especially belongs
i will give here only one complex example which will serve at the same time as an illustration of a special kind of very harmless to which is also subject and which consists in making verses not without knowing but at least without intending to do so and in connection with the most trifling matters
there are times when in spite of herself she feels compelled to speak in distinct rhymes of eight feet which she does not prepare and does not perceive until the moment she has finished uttering them
in this particular case it is by a quatrain a very unusual occurrence that she replies to some one who had consulted her in regard to some blue ribbon
but this quatrain by its style by the vision of the blond head of a child which accompanies it and by the manner also in which she writes it causes us to hazard the conjecture that it is an inspiration depending on the underlying royal cycle while in the following letter in which she the affair to m her pen all unknown to her strange characters evidently due to the cropping out of the cycle of which she speaks in the letter see fig

i have heard some words this afternoon but have not been able to retain them in my mind
i send you those heard a few days ago when i had the vision of which i am about to make you the design lamp
yesterday morning i for the first time spoke in verse without being aware of it it was only on finishing the sentence that i perceived that it and i reconstructed it to assure myself of the fact
a little later on examining some ribbons i began anew to speak in verse and i send those also they will amuse you
it is a curious thing that i had at that same moment the vision of the blond curly head of a child bound with a blue ribbon
the vision lasted more than a minute
what is still more curious i do not at all recollect having worn ribbons of that shade as a child i remember some some red but i have no recollection whatever of any blue ribbons
i really do not know why i spoke these words it is the more amusing
i was obliged to speak them i assure you in spite of myself
i was eager to put them on paper and i noticed in writing them down that for a moment the handwriting was not regular that is it was slightly different from mine
here is the quatrain the pencil impression of which is too faint to enable a facsimile to be reproduced here and in it i have indicated by italics the words and syllables the calligraphy or orthography of which differs from that of and becomes the style of automatic handwriting called that of les nuances de me jeunes je men bien the head of curly blond hair ornamented with blue ribbons also figures in the visions of the royal cycle and appears to belong as is here the case sometimes to herself sometimes to one or other of her children especially the dauphin
while it is generally easy to connect these of the volcano with the various dreams from which they such is not always the case and there are visions the origin of which is doubtful and ambiguous
we must not forget that alongside of the grand cycles of which are better known there also float in her latent imagination innumerable small accessory systems more or less independent which supply a large part of the such as revelations of former events connected with the families of the sitters
it is not always possible to identify the fragments from these isolated dreams
 teleological automatismsthe spontaneous phenomena of this category possessing as a common characteristic a practical utility for more or less marked can be into two classes according to their direct attachment to the personality of or their not belonging to any distinct personality and which only express in a vivid manner the result of the normal working although more or less unconscious of the faculties of memory and of reason
i confine myself now to citing one case of each of these classes of which we shall see other examples in the chapters relating to and to supernormal appearances
one day
wishing to take down a large and heavy object from a high shelf was prevented from so doing by the fact that her arms seemed as though petrified and incapable of being moved for some seconds she saw in this a warning and gave up her intention
in a later said that it was he himself who had caused arms to become rigid in order to prevent her from attempting to lift the object which was too heavy for her and would have caused some accident to befall her
on another occasion a clerk who sought vainly for a certain pattern asked if she knew what had become of it
replied mechanically and without reflection yes it was sent to mr j a customer of the firm at the same time there appeared before her in large black figures about eight or ten inches in height the number and she added instinctively it was eighteen days ago
this statement caused the clerk to smile because of its the rule of the house being that customers to whom patterns were lent for examination must return them inside of three days or a messenger would be sent for them
struck by this objection and having no conscious recollection of the affair replied really perhaps i am wrong
meanwhile an investigation of the date indicated in the records of the house showed that she was perfectly correct
it was through various with which she had nothing at all to do that the pattern had not been sent for or recovered
on being asked has no recollection of this circumstance and does not appear to have been the author of this of nor of many other analogous phenomena through which subconscious memory renders her signal services and has gained for her a and highly valued reputation
thus we see that if the spontaneous of
are often the vexatious result of her moments of suggestibility or the of her they also often assume the form of useful messages
such compensation is not to be despised
 the
has never been hypnotized
in her instinctive aversion which she shares with the majority of mediums to anything that seems like an attempt to experiment upon her she has always refused to allow herself to be put to sleep
she does not realize that in avoiding the idea she has actually accepted the reality since her experiences in reality constitute for her an which inevitably into a as she is brought under the influence of one or other of the persons present at the
all her have somewhat of the same form the same method of development running through their immense diversity of content
she places herself at the table with the idea and the intention of bringing into play her mediumistic faculties
after an interval varying from a few seconds to a quarter of an hour generally in a shorter time if the room is well darkened and the sitters are perfectly silent she begins to have visions preceded and accompanied by very varied sensory and motor disturbances after which she passes into a complete trance
in that state it rarely happens and then only for a few moments that she is entirely unconscious of the persons present and as it were shut up within her personal dream and plunged into profound lethargy hypnotic
ordinarily she remains in communication more or less close with one of the sitters who thus finds himself in the same relation towards her as a towards his subject and able to take advantage of that rapport by giving her any immediate or future suggestions that he may desire
when the consists only of waking visions it lasts generally only a short hour to an hour and a is ended quickly by three sharp upon the table after which
returns to her normal state which she scarcely seems to have left
if the has been complete the is prolonged to double that length of time and often longer and the return to the normal state comes slowly through phases of deep sleep alternating with into gestures and attitudes moments of
the final awakening is always preceded by several brief followed by into sleep
each of these preliminary as well as the final one is accompanied by the same characteristic movements of the features
the eyes which have been for a long time closed open wide stupidly staring into vacancy or fix themselves slowly on the objects and the sitters within their range of vision the dilated pupils do not react the face is an impassive and rigid mask devoid of expression
seems altogether absent
all at once with a slight heaving of the breast and raising of the head and a quick breath a gleam of intelligence illumines her countenance the mouth is gracefully opened the eyes become brilliant the entire countenance lights up with a pleasant smile and gives evidence of her recognition of the world and of her return to herself
but with the same suddenness with which it appeared that appearance of life lasts but a second or two the physiognomy its lifeless mask the eyes becoming haggard and fixed close again and the head falls on the back of the chair
this return of sleep will be followed by another sudden then perhaps by several more until the final always distinguished after the smile at the beginning by the stereotyped question what time is it and by a movement of surprise on learning that it is so late
there is no memory of what has transpired during the
a complete description of the psychological and physiological phenomena which present themselves or which might be obtained in the course of the would detain me too long since there is absolutely nothing constant either in the nature or in the succession of the phenomena and no two are evolved exactly in the same manner
i must confine myself to some striking characteristics
three principal symptoms almost generally announce that
is beginning to enter into her trance
there are on the one side emotional or modifications the cause of which is revealed a little later in the subsequent messages
is for instance seized by an invincible desire to laugh which she can not or will not explain or she complains of sadness fear of different unpleasant sensations of heat or of cold of nausea
according to the nature of the communications which are approaching and of which these emotional states are the forerunners
there are on the other hand phenomena of systematic negative hallucinations limited to those sitters whom the coming messages concern
ceases to see them while continuing to hear their voices and feel their touch or on the contrary she is astonished to no longer hear them though she sees their lips moving
or finally she does not perceive them in any manner and demands to know why they are leaving when the is hardly begun
in its details this systematic varies infinitely and extends sometimes to but one part of the person concerned to his hand to a portion of his face
without it always being possible to explain these capricious details by the content of the following visions it would seem that the of the dream presides over this preliminary work of disintegration and that the normal perceptions are absorbed by the subconscious personality eager for material for the building up of the hallucinations which it is preparing
systematic is often complicated with positive hallucinations and will manifest her surprise at seeing for example a strange costume or an unusual coiffure
this in reality is the vision which is already being installed
the third symptom which does not manifest itself clearly in her but the presence of which can be often established before all the others by investigation is a complete ordinarily accompanied by various other sensory and motor disturbances
if at the beginning of the is asked for example to raise her right hand to move the left or to close one eye she begins straightway to carry into effect these different acts then all at once without knowing why and without hesitation she deceives herself in regard to the side and raises her left hand moves her right closes the other eye
this indicates that she is no longer in her normal state though still appearing to retain her ordinary consciousness and with the liveliness of a normal person discusses the question of her having mistaken her right hand or eye for her left and vice versa
it is to be noted that on such occasions of pronounced does not share this error in regard to the side
i have assisted at some curious discussions between him and she insisting that such a hand was her right or that the isle is on the left as one passes the bridge of or coming from the railway station and all the while by means of upon the table giving her clearly to understand she was wrong
a little after the and sometimes simultaneously with it are to be found various other phenomena extremely variable of which i here cite only a few one of her arms is as it rests upon the table and resists the efforts of the sitters to lift it up as though it were a bar of iron the fingers of the hand also participate in this rigidity
sometimes this does not exist before but establishes itself at the same instant that some one touches the forearm and increases in proportion to the efforts which are made to overcome it
there is no regularity in the distribution of the changing from one instant to another the or convulsions which the hands and arms of exhibit
it all seems due to pure or to depend only on underlying dreams of which little is known
certain analogous and likewise capricious phenomena of paralysis sensations of all sorts of which complains often appear in her face her eyes her mouth
in the midst of all these disturbances the visions announce themselves and the is introduced with modifications equally variable of other functions evidenced by tears sighs repeated various changing of the rhythm of respiration
if is experimented upon and questioned too long the development of the original visions is obstructed and she easily reaches a degree of sensibility where she falls into the standard class of public representations of charmed and fascinated state in which she remains before some brilliant object as for example the ring trinkets or of one of the sitters then herself in a frenzy upon the object and tries to secure it or assumes emotional attitudes and poses under the influence of joyous airs upon the piano experiences suggested hallucinations of all kinds sees terrible serpents which she pursues with a pair of beautiful flowers which she smells with deep and distributes to the sitters or again bleeding wounds which have been made on her hand and which cause her to shed tears
the commonplace character of these phenomena causes their long continuance to be and the ingenuity of all is exercised in endeavoring by different means none of which is very efficacious or very rapid to plunge her into profound and tranquil sleep from which she is not long in passing of her own accord into complete and in taking up the thread of her personal imaginations
if all these disturbing investigations have been successfully avoided the spontaneous development of the is effected with greater rapidity and
it is possible then to behold in the same a very varied spectacle and to listen besides to certain special communications made in a state to one or other of the sitters then in complete a vision is presented followed by a dream with an incarnation of in the middle and a scene of to wind up with
ordinarily two of these last creations will suffice to fill up a
one such representation is not performed without the loss of considerable strength by the medium which shows itself by the final sleep being prolonged sometimes for an hour interrupted as i have said by repetitions of the preceding scenes easily recognizable by certain gestures or the murmuring of characteristic words
passing through these diverse and the ephemeral of which i have spoken above finishes by returning to her normal state but the which have been too long continued or too full of movement leave her very much fatigued for the rest of the day
it has also sometimes happened to her to the from which she had probably not completely emerged during the course of the evening or on returning home and only to succeed in recovering her perfectly normal state through the assistance of a nights sleep
as to the real nature of at the end of the and her states of consciousness when she it is difficult for me to pronounce having only been able to observe them under unfavorable is in the presence of sitters more or less numerous and restless
the greater part certainly consist of in which she hears all that passes around her since although she seems profoundly asleep and absent the suggestions then given her to be carried out after are registered and performed least when who is almost always on hand and answers by movements of one finger or another to questions put to him does not make any opposition or declare that the suggestion shall not be carried out i there are also brief moments when seems to be in a profound state of and kind of without trace of psychic life her pulse and respiration continue to be regular but she does not react to any her arms if raised fall heavily no sign of can be obtained and suggestions made at that instant will not be acted upon
these phases during which all consciousness seems to be abolished are generally followed by phases in which the hands and arms preserve every position in which they may be placed and continue the movements of rotation or of oscillation which may be forced upon them but never for more than one or two minutes
in default of more complete experiments i submit the following comparison of muscular force and of her sensibility to pain before and after a lasting nearly three hours the second half being in full
at
on sitting down at the table three tests with her right hand gave
 average  the sensibility to pain measured on the back of the median phalanx of the with the of gave for the right
average for the left average
 sensibility slightly more delicate than that of another lady present at the not a medium and in perfect health
at
some minutes after the final right hand
average
complete both as to right and left on the whole of the back of the index as well as the rest of the hand and wrist the maximum of the instrument
was attained and passed without arousing any painful sensation but only an impression of contact
one hour later after dinner average for the right for the left
it is possible then to say that her muscular force and sensibility to pain both normal immediately before her entrance upon the are still abolished in the first fifteen minutes after but are found to be restored in about an hour
perception of colors on the contrary appeared to be as perfect immediately after as before the
the tremor of the normal before the is very much exaggerated in its amplitude for a certain time after and reflects sometimes the respiratory movements as can be seen by the curves of fig
 this denotes a great diminution of kinesthetic sensibility and of voluntary control over the immobility of the hand
the state in which
carries out the suggestions made to her in the course of her when they do not come into collision with either the pronounced opposition of or the states of lethargy of which i have spoken is interesting on account of its varied character which seems to depend upon the greater or less ease with which the or the act suggested can be reconciled with normal personality
their execution in the full waking state seems to be confined to suggestions of simple acts free from absurdity the idea of which would be easily accepted and carried out by the normal self when the desired moment arrived
if on the contrary it is a question of more complicated and difficult things compatible however with the rational points of view of the normal waking state falls momentarily into for the execution of the order given unless she has permanently remained in that state in spite of her apparent in order not to definitely and completely upon her ordinary state until after the execution of the order of which there then remains to her no recollection whatever
from the foregoing facts we may conclude that little or nothing of that which goes on around her escapes her subconscious intelligence and it is from this source that her romances are nourished afresh
a word more as to the preparation for the
i do not refer to a conscious preparation but to a incubation or elaboration unknown by her showing itself on the level of her ordinary personality in the form of fugitive and fragmentary images during her sleep at night or the moments of in the morning
 in reality has no hold possesses no influence upon the nature of her visions and
she is able undoubtedly up to a certain point to aid their appearance in a general way by cultivating tranquillity of mind securing darkness and silence in the room and by abandoning herself to a passive attitude of mind or to it on the other hand by movement or distraction of attention but with the fixed and concrete content itself of her she has nothing to do and no share in the responsibility for it
so far as her great cycles or her detached messages are concerned they are fabricated in her in spite of herself and without her having a word to say about their production any more than one has in the formation of his dreams
when it is recollected on the other hand that the phenomena of incubation of preparation or unconscious are universal facts playing their in the psychology of every human being we can rely upon finding them also among the mediums and upon their holding a place with them much more important than with others owing to the fact that their subconscious life is so much more fully developed
with each one of us the expectation or the simple perspective of any departure a visit an errand or undertaking to do anything a letter to write in short all the more insignificant incidents of daily existence when they are not absolutely a psychological adaptation more or less extended and profound
alongside of and underneath the conscious expectancy certain physical or mental attitudes voluntarily assumed in view of the event always effect an underlying preparation of an inward kind a change which we may regard according to the side from which we consider the individual as a peculiar psychical orientation or cerebral adjustment a modification in the association of ideas or in the dynamics of the cortical nerves
but everything points to the fact that in persons gifted with mediumship this underlying preparation is capable of assuming on occasion a greater importance than is the case with ordinary mortals a much more complete independence of the ordinary consciousness to return to
when she knows some time in advance who will be present at her next and what people she will almost surely meet there it would be altogether natural that such previous knowledge of the environment and of the sitters would influence her thoughts and in some degree direct the course of the latent incubation
it may well be asked therefore whether the varied spectacle which the furnish is really always impromptu and has its birth on the spur of the moment like ordinary dreams or whether it has been subconsciously thought out the being only the performance of an arrested the representation of scenes already ripened in the deep strata of the medium
neither of these two hypotheses held to exclude the other answers to the facts but there is some truth in both of them
the menu of the the expression is always composed of one or two de carefully prepared in advance in the laboratories and of various hors left to the inspiration of the moment
to speak more exactly the general plot the chief lines and more striking points of the scenes which unfold themselves are fixed according to a previous arrangement but the details of execution and accessory are entirely dependent upon chance circumstances
the proof of this is found on the one hand in the suppleness the perfect ease the appropriateness with which we can still apply the word to those cases in which spontaneity free use of all the faculties constitute the dominant adapt themselves to unexpected situations in the environment or capricious interruptions on the part of the sitters on the other hand in the fact that at the beginning of the ordinarily knows very well and announces the principal vision or which are about to make their appearance provided at least the spectators do not their unfolding by their clamor for something else
the animated conversations sometimes full of spirited repartee between or and the sitters could not have been prepared in advance and are altogether opposed to the stereotyped repetition which is generally expected of automatic phenomena
but on the other hand such repetition almost entirely mechanical and devoid of sense presents itself on frequent occasions
i have for instance seen scenes presented which were entirely misplaced and constituted at the time veritable anachronisms which would have perfectly fitted the situation eight days previously in another environment and for which the aforesaid scenes had been evidently intended but having been withheld until the last moment by unforeseen circumstances the following gets the benefit of these postponed messages
here is proof that imagination prepares up to a certain point her principal productions in view of the conditions and surroundings under which the will probably take place and also that these products once elaborated must be eliminated and poured forth with a sort of blind necessity at the right or the wrong time whenever the entrance of into a favorable state furnishes them an opportunity so to do
it follows also that her normal personality has nothing whatever to do with the preparation of the since she can neither suppress nor change scenes badly adapted to the actual environment the appearance of which sometimes greatly annoys
when they are recounted to her after the nor can she provoke the messages the production of which she desires and vainly hopes for example a medical consultation with the incarnation of a deceased parent or a scene from one cycle rather than from the others for the benefit of a sitter who particularly desires it and whom she is very desirous to please
much more could be said concerning the psychological side of the of
but i must limit myself
it will be possible to gain a more complete idea of this subject by studying the illustrations in the following chapters on the chief cycles of her brilliant fantasy
is really as he pretends or since he has nothing in common with the famous of the last century save a certain superficial resemblance is he at any rate a real being separate from and independent of
or finally is he only a a kind of modification of herself a product of her imagination just like our dream creations and the suggested to a hypnotic subject of these three suppositions it is the last which to my mind is undoubtedly the true one while in
eyes it is as certainly the false view
it would be hard to imagine a more profound difference of opinion than that which exists between
and myself on this subject
it is i always who get the worst of a discussion with her concerning it
i yield for two reasons
first out of politeness and secondly because i understand perfectly and putting myself in her place realize that i should think exactly as she does about the matter
given her surroundings and personal experiences it is impossible for her to do otherwise than believe in the objective distinct existence of that mysterious being who constantly enters into her life in a sensible and way leaving her no room to doubt
he presents himself before her endowed with corporeality like that of other people and hides objects which are behind him exactly as an ordinary individual of flesh and bone would do he talks into her ears generally into the left in a characteristic voice which appears to come from a variable distance sometimes about six feet off sometimes much farther
he jars the table on which she has placed her arms takes hold of her wrist and writes with her hand holding the pen in a manner unlike her and with a handwriting wholly different from hers
he puts her to sleep without her knowledge and she is astonished to learn upon that he has gesticulated with her arms and spoken through her mouth in the deep bass voice of a man with an accent which has nothing in common with the clear and beautiful quality of her feminine voice
moreover he is not always on hand
he by no means answers appeals on all occasions is not at her mercy far from it
his conduct his manifestations his comings and goings can not be predicted with any certainty and testify to an being endowed with often otherwise occupied or absent on his own affairs which do not permit of his holding himself constantly at the disposal of
 sometimes he remains for weeks without revealing himself in spite of her wishing for him and calling upon him
then all at once he makes his appearance when she least expects him
he speaks for her in a way she would have no idea of doing he dictates to her poems of which she would be incapable
he replies to her oral or mental questions with her and discusses various questions
like a wise friend a rational mentor and as one seeing things from a higher plane he gives her advice counsel orders even sometimes directly opposite to her wishes and against which she rebels
he consoles her her encourages and her he undertakes against her the of persons she does not like and pleads the cause of those who are to her
in a word it would be impossible to imagine a being more independent or more different from
herself having a more personal character an individuality more marked or a more certain actual existence
is also fortified in this conviction by the belief not only of members of her own family but by that of other cultivated people who having attended many of her have no doubt whatever of objective and separate existence
there are those who believe so firmly in the reality of this superior being invisible to them that they are in the habit of calling upon him during the absence of
 naturally they obtain responses through the table or otherwise and that causes unforeseen complications sometimes when she comes to learn of it
for while she admits himself has often declared the same he extends his surveillance and protection from afar over other groups and especially over all friends and in practice and in fact however it happens that neither he nor she will willingly admit the authenticity of those pretended communications from obtained in the absence of the medium of his
it is generally some deceiving spirit who has manifested in his place on these occasions
these denials however do not prevent those who have become believers from continuing to believe in the of this good genius or from teaching their children to him to make vows and address prayers to him
it must not be forgotten that is a religion
this also explains the great respect shown to mediums which is like that accorded to priests
it follows that without in the least from speaking ill of them whenever they think they have a grievance against them on the other hand they bestow on them the same marks of respect as are only accorded to the most sublime product of the human race
i have known a salon where on the centre table in full view and in the place of honor were two photographs in beautiful frames on the one side the head of on the other the portrait
 among other believers with less ideal but more practical aspirations no business matter of importance is closed no serious decision made until has been consulted through as an intermediary and the cases are too numerous to mention in which he has furnished important information prevented a heavy loss given an efficacious medical prescription
it is easily seen how all the successes obtained by paragraph continues and the mystical veneration which many very persons accord him must contribute to strengthen the faith of in her
it is in vain that against this absolute assurance one seeks to avail ones self of the arguments of contemporary psychology
the example of the of the dream the analogies taken from and from considerations of mental disintegration the division of the consciousness and the formation of second personalities all these refined subtleties of our modern scientists break in pieces like glass against immovable rock
i shall not undertake to combat a proposition which for her has so much evidence in its favor and which resolves all difficulties in the most felicitous manner and in conformity to good
nevertheless since each individual has a right to his own opinion in the world i beg leave to assume for the time being that does not exist outside of
and to try to discover his possible genesis in the mental life of the by hypothesis and by means of psychological experiment
therefore readers who have little taste for this kind of academic composition had better skip this chapter
i of a description of the development of is not easy since he has a double origin apparent and real like the nerves which give so much trouble to the students of anatomy
his apparent origin or i should say the moment when he is outwardly separated from the personality of and as an independent spirit is relatively clear and well marked but his actual origin profoundly in the most inward strata of personality and mixed up with them presents great obscurities and can only be determined in a very manner
let us begin with the apparent origin or the first appearance of at the
it is easy to understand that once initiated into and plunged into a current of ideas where the comforting doctrine of and holds an important place
did not delay in coming into possession of like all good mediums a spirit specially attached to her person
she even had two in succession victor and
it is not a question of a simple change of name of the guide of who presented himself first under the aspect and the name of the great poet and then afterwards adopted that of the renowned but there were at least at the beginning two different personalities apparently hostile to each other one of whom by degrees supplanted the other after a struggle a trace of which is found in the very incomplete reports of the of that period
three phases can also be distinguished in the of
guide an initial phase of five months during which victor reigns alone a phase of transition of about a year when the protection of victor is seen to be powerless to protect and her group against the invasion of an intruder called who claims and an increasing authority over the medium by virtue of mysterious relations in the course of a previous existence finally the present period which has lasted for six years past in which victor no longer figures and which may be dated approximately from the moment when it was revealed that is only an assumed name under which he hides in reality the great personality of
i do not find any fact worthy of mention in the first phase in which victor who seems to have appeared as the guide of
about the of april see above p played a of no importance
in the second phase however it is necessary to cite some extracts from the reports of the of the n group in order to throw light upon the singular character which manifested there from the beginning
august a spirit announces himself under the name of
he comes for
and seems to wish to have a great authority over her
she sees him for some moments he appears to be about years of age and is clothed altogether in black
the expression of his countenance is rather pleasing and through answers to some questions which we put to him we are given to understand that he knew her in another existence and that he does not wish her to give her heart to any one here below

 recognizes her guide victor
she is made happy by his arrival and asks his protection against the obsession of this new spirit
he answers that she has nothing to fear that he will always be present
she is joyful at being guarded and protected by him and feels that she has nothing to fear

 comes also but
fears nothing since her guide victor is there to protect her

 an unpleasant evening
a spirit announces himself
it is
he speaks to us at once i am here
i wish to be master of this sitting
we are very much disappointed and do not expect any good of him
he tries as he had already done once before to put
to sleep who has great difficulty in struggling against this sleep
she rises from the table hoping by this means to rid herself of him and that he will give up his place to others
she returns in about ten minutes but he is still there and apparently has no intention of abandoning his place
we summon our friends spiritual to our aid

 they take place momentarily but very soon returns we struggle with him we desire him to go away but neither soft nor hard words have any effect before that dogged determination we realize that all our efforts will be useless and we decide to close the
manifestation by the favorite spirits of the group who declare that they have not been able to come as they would have liked to do that they were prevented by the spirit of who is trying to introduce himself to us that we should him as much as possible persuaded that he does not come for any good end
i do not know whether we shall be able to rid ourselves of him but we greatly fear that he will us and retard our advancement

 announces himself
we try to reason with him we do not wish to forbid his coming but we ask of him that he shall come as a friend to all and not in the of master
he is not satisfied appears to bear much malice
we trust he will come to have better feelings
he shows himself walks around the table bows to us and each one with his hand and retires again leaving his place to others
after a quarter of an hour of motionless and silent waiting in darkness around the table
is questioned and she is shaken in vain
she is asleep
by the advice of persons present we allow her to remain asleep when at the end of five minutes the table raises itself a spirit announces himself
it is victor we ask if he has anything to say he answers yes and spells out wake her do not allow her ever to sleep
we try to do so
we are nervous about that sleep we have great difficulty in awakening her
after twenty minutes of waiting arrives and as is his habit puts the medium to sleep for some minutes he us and prevents our friends from coming to the table
he vexes us in every way and goes contrary to all our wishes
in presence of that rancor the sitters regret the indications of they have shown towards him and deplore having to pay so dear for them
it is with difficulty that the medium can be awakened
in one of the of this month a remarkable thing happened the spirit of who was very much irritated on that day twice in succession took away her chair from our medium and carried it to the farther end of the room while
fell heavily to the floor
not expecting this wretched farce
struck her knee so hard that for several days she suffered pain in walking
we were obliged to terminate the we were not comfortable
why this animosity this word animosity describes very well the conduct and the feelings that seemed to have towards the n group and against his placid rival victor
the personal recollections of the sitters whom i have been able to confirm the substantial physiognomy of the two figures
that of is in effect and altogether eclipsed by the totally opposite character of the arrogant who takes a peculiar pleasure in the of vindictive and jealous the appearance of the spirits desired by the group putting the medium to sleep or causing her to fall on the floor forbidding her to give her heart to another and breaking up the as far as he is able
it seems to have finally resulted in the meetings of the n group coming to an end at the beginning of the summer then comes a break of six months after which i find paragraph continues
on the of inaugurating a new series of with an entirely different group organized by prof
here victor very rarely appears and never in the of guide which is freely accorded without objection to whose real identity was no secret to any one in the new environment
it was therefore in the course of the year at a period which can not be precisely determined from the records that the rivalry of these two personalities was terminated by the complete triumph of the second
it follows from the preceding recital that the appearance of in of the n group was a phenomenon of manifest contrast of hostility and of antagonism towards that group
it is a difficult and delicate task to pronounce upon the complex spirit of an environment of which one was not a part and in regard to which one possesses only a few and not very concordant incidents
the following however seem to be the facts the n group much more numerous than is convenient in of that kind was composed of very varied elements
alongside of serious believers were ordinarily some students who boarded with one of the ladies of the group and who do not appear to have felt the seriousness of reunions
that age has no mercy and the profound of the often escaped their superficial and frivolous intelligence
under such conditions
was inevitably compelled to experience two contrary impressions
on the one hand she perceived herself admired made much of as the medium which she really was and upon whom the group depended for its existence on the other hand her secret instincts and high personal dignity could not but be offended by the to which she was exposed in this mixed environment
i regard the two rival and successive guides of as the expression of this double sentiment
if she had been brought up like an woman or if her nature had been a degree less fine the frivolity of the would undoubtedly have only given more warmth and to victor instead of which the victorious colors of are raised over a nature of great native pride extremely sensitive on the point of feminine dignity and whose severe and rigid education had already exalted her sense of
after a struggle of a year between these two of opposite emotional tendencies the second as we have seen finally triumphs and
from the n group which at the same time breaks up
the idea i have formed of is now apparent
he represents to my mind in
the synthesis the the expansion the most hidden springs of the psychological organism
he forth from that deep and mysterious sphere into which the deepest roots of our individual existence are plunged which bind us to the species itself and perhaps to the absolute and whence spring our instincts of physical and moral our sexual feelings
when found herself in an environment not exactly dangerous but where she simply ran the risk as in the n group of yielding to some inclination contrary to her fundamental aspirations it is then that suddenly springs up speaking as the master taking possession of the medium for himself and indicating his unwillingness that she should attach herself to any one here below
we here recognize the same principle of and which was already active in her as a young girl in the teleological arising on the occasion of certain emotional shocks of which i have spoken on p
but by these considerations we have travelled very far from the original appearance of in the of the of august towards his actual more ancient origin
this seems to date from a great fright which had in the course of her tenth year
as she was walking along the street on her way home from school she was attacked by a big dog
the terror of the poor child can well be imagined and from which she was happily delivered by a personage clothed in a long brown robe with flowing sleeves and with a white cross on the breast who appearing to her suddenly and as by a miracle chased the dog away and disappeared before she had time to thank him
but according to this personage was no other than himself who on this occasion for the first time appeared to and saved her by driving away the dog
this explanation was given by on the of in a in which experienced in a state a repetition of that scene of fright with cries gestures of struggle and attempts at flight
in the waking state she very well recalls this episode of her childhood but can not accept as the person who came to her rescue but believes it to have been a priest or member of some religious order who rushed to her assistance and drove the animal away
her parents also recollected the incident which she told them one day on returning from school in a very excited state and after which she could not for a long time encounter a dog in the street without hiding herself in the folds of her mothers dress
she has since always preserved an instinctive aversion towards dogs
we have seen p that after this first incident matters remained in statu quo for four years up to the time when the age of puberty began to favor the development of the oriental visions
here to whom we owe this information does not altogether agree with himself for at one time he says that it was he himself who furnished
with her visions of at another time he says that they are reminiscences of one of her former
alongside of these varied visions has clearly appeared under the form of the in the dark robe in a number of cases
i will only cite two examples one very remote the other quite recent
one day went to consult her family physician for some trifling ailment who having known her for a long time and being an old friend of her family presumed to give her an innocent kiss
he was quite unprepared for the explosion of wrath which this familiarity provoked and hastened to make his apologies but what is of interest to us in this connection is the fact that under the shock of this emotion her defender of the brown robe appeared before her in the corner of the room and did not leave her side until she had reached home
a short time ago this same always in the same costume accompanied her several days in succession while she was traversing a part of the route towards her place of business
one evening also he appeared to her at the entrance to the street leading to the locality in question in the attitude of the way and obliged her to make a to regain her house
 has the several indications go to show that she is not it is with the purpose of sparing her some unpleasant sight or a dangerous encounter that in the brown robe appears to her under perfectly wellknown conditions
he rises before her always at a distance of about ten yards walks or rather glides along in silence at the same rate as she advances towards him attracting and fascinating her gaze in such a manner as to prevent her turning her eyes away from him either to the right or the left until she has passed the place of danger
it is to be noted that whereas under other instance at the himself to her in the most varied costumes and speaks on all subjects it is always under his aspect silent and clothed in his long dark robe that he appears to her on those occasions of real life in which she is exposed to feelings of fright peculiar to her sex as he appeared to her on that first occasion in her tenth year
the hints i have given sufficiently justify i think my opinion that the real and origin of is to be found in that deep and delicate sphere in which we so often encounter the roots of phenomena and to which the most illustrious such as seem to owe a great part not only of the intellectual content but
of the imaginative form the wrapping of their genius
there is a double problem to be solved in
case
why have these instinctive feelings and emotional tendencies which are common to the entire human race succeeded in developing in her a product so complex and highly organized is is the personality of and why in the second place does that personality believe itself to be i instantly reply that these two results are to my mind entirely the effect of
to explain the first the simple fact of her being occupied with and engaged in mediumistic experiments is sufficient
take any individual having in her memories emotional tendencies put into her head then seat her at a table or put a pencil in her hand even though she may not be of a very or temperament or inclined to the mental disintegration which the general public calls the mediumistic faculty nevertheless it will not be long before her elements group themselves and arrange themselves according to the personal form to which all consciousness tends and which discloses itself outwardly by communications which have the appearance of coming directly from spirits
in the case of
did not exist under the title of a distinct secondary personality before began to be occupied with
it was at the of the n group by an emotional reaction against certain influences as we have seen that he began little by little to take shape aided by memories of the same general tone until he finally grew into an apparently independent being revealing himself through the table manifesting a will and a mind of his own recalling analogous former incidents of life and claiming for himself the merit of having intervened in it in the of her
once established this secondary self could not do otherwise than to grow and to develop and strengthen itself in all directions to itself a host of new data favoring the state of suggestibility which accompanies the exercise of mediumship
without the and the of the could never have been truly developed into a personality but would have continued to remain in the nebulous incoherent state of vague and of occasional automatic phenomena
the second problem that of explaining why this secondary personality once established believes itself to be rather than any other celebrated personage or of remaining simply the anonymous guardian angel of
would demand a very complete knowledge of the thousand outside influences which have surrounded since the beginning of her mediumship and which may have involuntarily influenced her
but on this point i have only succeeded in collecting a very few incidents which leave much still to be desired and are of such a character that it is entirely permissible for any one to claim that the purely psychological origin of that personality is not clearly established and to prefer if he chooses the actual intervention of the to my hypothesis of
the following however are the facts advanced by me in support of the latter the authoritative and jealous spirit the evident enemy of the n group who manifested himself on the of august under the name of did not reveal his identity as that of until some time afterwards under the following circumstances one of the most regular attendants at the reunions of the n group was a
b who had long been an adherent of and who had previously attended numerous at the house of m and
a thoroughly convinced couple of amateurs now deceased whose salon and round table have held a very honorable place in the history of
but i learned from
b that one of the spirits who manifested himself at the of m and
was this very
there is indeed no figure in history which accords better with the idea of a posthumous return to the mysteries of the round table than that of the enigmatic especially since has surrounded him with an additional halo of romance
not content with the public reunions of the n group
b often invited to her house for private of which no record was made
at one of these having had a vision of who pointed out to her with a wand a
b suddenly thought of a celebrated episode in the life of and after the she proceeded to take from a drawer and show to an engraving taken from an illustrated edition of representing the famous scene of the between and the dauphin at the of
at the same time she gave utterance to the idea that the spirit who manifested himself at the table by means of hands was certainly and she expressed her astonishment that had given him the name of to which replied that it was he himself who had given that name
 b continuing her deductions told
that perhaps she had formerly been the medium of the great magician and consequently had been in a former life
at once accepted the idea and for several weeks considered herself to be the of until one day a lady of her acquaintance remarked that it was impossible having never existed save in the imagination and the romances of
thus dispossessed of her supposed former existence was not long in declaring through the table that she was
as to a short time after
b had identified him with he himself confirmed that hypothesis at a of the n group dictating to the table that his real name was
the origin of the name of is very obscure and many hypotheses have been advanced to account for it without our being able to establish any of them with certainty
one fact however is certain namely that save for the vague affirmation that he had known in a previous existence had never pretended to be or given any reason for being thought so before the reunion where
b who had been for some time accustomed to manifestations of that personage announced the and showed
immediately after the at a moment when she was probably still in a very state an engraving from works representing and the dauphin
from that day on his part never failed to claim that personality and progressively to realize the character of the in a very remarkable manner as we shall see
 personification of by there is no need i think to remind the reader of the wellknown often described under the names of objectivity of types personification change of personality etcthat a hypnotized subject can be transformed by a word into such other living being as may be desired according to the measure in which his suggestibility on the one hand and the vividness of his imagination and the of his knowledge or memories on the other enables him to the which is imposed upon him
without investigating here to what extent mediums may be likened to hypnotized subjects it is undeniable that an analogous phenomenon takes place in them but the process is more gradual and may extend itself over several years
in place of the immediate metamorphosis which modifies at one stroke and instantly to a prescribed type the attitude the physiognomy the gestures the words the intonations of voice the style the handwriting and other functions besides we are in the case of the medium in the presence of a development formed by successive stages arranged according to grades with intervals of different lengths which finally succeed in creating a complete personality all the more astonishing at first sight because the involuntary suggestions have not been noticed the of which have little by little caused its birth
this process of development is present in a high degree in the case of
in the elaboration of her secondary personality
in the beginning in and this spirit only manifested himself by the brief periods of sleep which he induced in at certain by struck upon the table by visions in which he showed himself clothed in black and of youthful appearance and more rarely by hallucinations
his character and the content of his messages were summed up in imperious authoritative domineering manners with the of claiming
all for himself of defending her against the influences of the n group and finally of her from that environment
there was nothing however in this general character of monopoly and of protection which specially recalled the of history or of romance
the personification of complete objectivity of this established type really began only in when had no longer to struggle with an environment foreign to his nature
the subconscious psychological task of realization of the proposed model could then be followed by him more freely in terms was able to manifest himself and make himself known in a manner more complete through as an intermediary while continuing to follow and protect her as the of the royal object of his passion
at the held with m frequently showed himself to clothed after the fashion of the last century and with a face like that of
under the different phases of his genius
he also showed himself to her in his laboratory surrounded by utensils and instruments appropriate to the and that he was or again as the physician and possessor of secret the knowledge of which is productive of consultations or remedies for the use of sitters who need them or again as the illumined the prophet of the brotherhood of man who diffuses limping seem to have been inherited from his predecessor victor exhortations a little weak at times but always stamped with a pure moral tone elevated and noble sentiments and a very touching religious short a fine example of that if i may be allowed the expression which is an which both in prose and in verse is one of the most frequent and products of mediumship
but it was not until that by the progress made by the automatic phenomena in multiplied and perfected his processes of communication
the first step consisted in substituting in his by spelling the movements of the hand or of a single finger for those of the whole table
this was the immediate result of a suggestion of mine
the second step in advance was the handwriting which shows two stages
in the first gave the impression of a phrase which she copied in pencil on a sheet of paper in her own handwriting
the second fig

 which was only accomplished five months later and which consisted in writing directly with hand permitted the immediate establishment of three curious facts
one is that holds his pen in the usual manner the handle resting between the thumb and the while in writing always holds her or pencil between the index and middle fingers a very rare habit with us
the next is that has an entirely different handwriting from that of a calligraphy more regular larger more painstaking and with marked differences in the formation of the letters see

the third is that he uses the style of handwriting of the last century and puts an o instead of an a in the tenses of the verbs for
these three characteristics he has never departed from during all the four years that i have been accumulating specimens of his handwriting
the following is a of the at which these two innovations took place
april as i had just asked a question which he did not like being in a state of with a pencil and some sheets of paper placed before her in the hope of obtaining some communication not from seemed about to plunge into a very interesting perusal of one of the blank sheets then at my request which she with difficulty comprehended she commenced to write rapidly and nervously on another sheet in her usual handwriting a copy of the imaginary text which was showing her in fluid letters as he said afterwards at the as follows my thoughts are not thy thoughts and thy wishes are not mine friend
at the final awakening recognized perfectly her own handwriting in his phrase but had no recollection of the occurrence
after different visions and some of victor dictated by the table appeared to suffer considerably in her right arm which she was holding at the wrist with her left hand when the table at which she was seated gave out the following dictated by i shall hold her hand meaning that it was he who was causing
to suffer pain by her right hand
as she seemed to feel very badly and began to weep was asked to but he refused and still speaking through the table said give her some paper then more light
writing material was furnished her and the lamp brought in which gazed at while continued to dictate this time with the little finger of her left hand let her gaze on the lamp until she the pain in her arm
she then seemed in fact to forget her pain and to find satisfaction in looking at the lamp then she fastened her eyes on the paper and seemed to read something there which she endeavored to copy in pencil
but here the right hand began a curious alternation of contrary motions expressing in a very clear manner a contest with who was trying to compel her to hold the pencil in a certain way which refused to do with a great pretence of anger
she persisted in holding it between the index and middle fingers as was her wont while wanted her to hold it in the usual way between the thumb and the and said i do not wish her to

she is holding the pencil very badly
the right then went through a very gymnastic performance being seized with a tremor which caused her to place it on one side or the other of the pencil according to whether it was or who was victorious during this time she frequently raised her eyes with a look sometimes sometimes supplicating as if to gaze at standing by her side endeavoring to force her to hold the pencil in the manner he preferred
after a contest of nearly twenty minutes and completely subdued by seemed to be absent while her hand holding the pencil in the manner she did not like wrote slowly the two following lines followed by a rapid and feverish signature of que pour tout le ttuleopold
paragraph continues an allusion which was of no importance to a remark made by me at the commencement of the on the verses of victor and those of frequently dictated by the table
the lasted some time longer on awakening vaguely remembered having seen but knew nothing more concerning the handwriting scene
it is a fact that while her other are always accomplished passively and without any struggle that of has the peculiarity of regularly more or less resistance on the part of
i do not make of her all that i wish

she is

 i do not know whether i shall succeed

 i do not believe i can master her today

replies he often when asked to incarnate himself or write with her hand and indeed his efforts often fail
there exists between and her guide a curious phenomenon of contrast and opposition which only breaks out in the higher and more recent forms of motor the handwriting the speech or the complete incarnation but from which the sensory messages and simple on the table or of the finger are free
it is very possible that the idea very to of the mastering his subjects in spite of the using his medium as a simple been subconsciously the origin of this constant note of revolt against the total domination of and of the intense suffering which accompanied his first and which has slowly diminished through her becoming accustomed to the process though it has never been completely banished
after the handwriting in its turn came speech which also was attained by means of two stages
in a first attempt only succeeded in giving his intonation and after a in which she suffered acutely in her mouth and in her neck as though her vocal organs were being manipulated or removed she began to talk in a natural tone and was apparently wide awake and feeling well but spoke with a deep bass voice and a strong easily recognizable accent
it was not until a year later that was finally able to speak himself by the mouth of
while she was completely entranced and who did not retain on awakening any memory of this strange occurrence
since then the complete control of the medium by her guide is a frequent occurrence at the and affords a tableau very characteristic and always impressive
succeeds in himself only by slow degrees and progressive stages
then feels as though her arms had been seized or as if they were absent altogether then she complains of disagreeable sensations which were formerly painful in her throat the of her neck and in her head her eyelids droop her expression changes her throat swells into a sort of double chin which gives her a likeness of some sort to the wellknown figure of
all at once she rises then turning slowly towards the sitter whom is about to address draws herself up proudly turns her back quickly sometimes with her arms crossed on her breast with a air sometimes with one of them hanging down while the other is pointed solemnly towards heaven and with her fingers makes a sort of sign which never varies
soon after a series of sighs and various noises indicate the difficulty is experiencing in taking hold of the vocal apparatus the words come forth slowly but strong the deep bass voice of a man slightly confused with a and accent markedly foreign certainly more like than anything else
is not always easily understood especially when his voice swells and out a reply to some indiscreet question or to the remarks of some skeptical sitter
he speaks thickly g like and all his us like accents the final syllables his vocabulary with obsolete words or words which do not fit the circumstances such as for for
he is pompous grandiloquent sometimes severe and terrible sometimes also sentimental
he says thee and thou to everybody and appears to believe that he is still of the secret societies from the emphatic and sonorous manner in which he the words brother or and thou my sister by which he addresses the sitters
although he generally addresses himself to one of them in particular and holds very little collective discourse he is in touch with every one listens to everything that is said and each one may have his turn in conversation with him
ordinarily he keeps his eyelids closed he has nevertheless been persuaded to open his eyes in order to permit the taking of a photograph by a flash light
i regret that
would not consent to the publication of her photographs either in her normal state or in that of in connection with the reproduction of a portrait of
the reader may assure himself that when she her guide she really assumes a certain resemblance of features to him and there is something in her attitude which is sometimes somewhat theatrical but sometimes really majestic which corresponds well to the generally received idea of this personage whether he is regarded as a clever or as a wonderful genius
speech is the apogee of the of often interrupted by fits of and spasms it seems to be injurious to organism and there are some at which attempts to produce it fail to succeed
on these occasions indicates his impotence and the fatigue of the medium by his gestures and is then reduced to the necessity of expressing himself by digital or handwriting or else to giving hallucinations the content of which she repeats in her natural voice
from the point of view of ease and mobility of the entire organism there is a notable difference between and the other of these last seem to be effected with much more facility than in the case of that of her guide par excellence
in the case of the princess and that of the perfection of the play the suppleness and freedom of movement are always admirable
it is true there is no question here according to the doctrine and the subconscious ideas of
of properly so called since it is she herself who simply returns to that which she formerly was by a sort of or she does not undergo in consequence any foreign possession and can in these preserve her natural identity and the entire disposition of her faculties
but still the occasional incarnation of different personalities such as those of deceased parents or friends of the spectators are often more easily and quickly effected than that of
moves in these cases with more vivacity and changes of attitude
in the of on the other hand with the exception of the grandiose and not very frequent movements of the arms once standing she remains motionless or only with difficulty advancing a little way towards the person to whom she addresses her discourse
the content of the oral conversations of as well as of his other messages by the various sensory and motor processes is too varied for me to describe here the numerous examples scattered through this work only can give an idea of it
 and the true it would naturally be supposed that would have given us by means of the psychological perfection of his partial or total and by the content of his messages such a living likeness of that there would have been occasion to ask whether it is not really the latter who actually returns in the same way that dr and his colleagues ask themselves whether it is not actually who himself through mrs
let us suppose for example that possessed a handwriting an orthography a style identical with that which is found here and there in the manuscripts of that he spoke or as that cosmopolitan did and with all the same peculiarities that his conversations and messages were full of precise allusions to actual events in his life and also of unpublished but facts
in that case the difficult and delicate task of proving that
had no knowledge through normal methods of these thousand exact features would still remain and we should not be forced to ask whether this authentic is simply a very an admirable reconstruction a imitation such as the faculties are only too glad to produce for the diversion of psychologists and the mystification of the simple
this problem is not given to us
i regret it but it is true my mind at least for in these matters it is prudent to speak only for ones there is no reason to suspect the real presence of behind the of
 that there are very curious analogies between what is known to us of and certain characteristic traits of i do not deny but they are precisely such as accord very well with the of the medley

to facilitate the comparison i have reproduced here see
and some fragments of letters of and of and of
let us is perhaps open to the handwriting of by its regularity its firmness resembles that of more than that of
the degree of resemblance does not i think go beyond that which might be expected considering the notorious fact that handwriting reflects the psychological temperament and modifies itself in accordance with the state of the personality
it is well known how the calligraphy of a subject varies according to the suggestion that he shall a little girl or an old man there is nothing surprising in the fact that the secondary personality of which imagines itself to be the powerful and manly count of should be accompanied by muscular tensions communicating to the handwriting itself a little of that solidity and breadth which are found in the autograph of

the extravagant signature of with which all his messages are subscribed see fig
recalls in no wise that of di at the bottom of fig
 the archaic forms of orthography for
which appear above the first autograph of see p and which occur again in the messages of constitute a very pretty hit of which the ordinary self would probably never dream by way of voluntary imitation but by which the subconscious imagination has seen fit to profit
it is undoubtedly a matter for that
who has not gone very deep into literary studies should nevertheless have retained these orthographic peculiarities of the eighteenth century but we must not overlook the fineness of choice the refined sensibility the consummate albeit instinctive art which presides over the sorting and storing away of the subconscious memories
by some natural affinity the idea of a personage of a certain epoch attracts and gathers into its net everything that the subject can possibly learn or hear spoken concerning the fashion of writing of speaking or acting peculiar to that epoch
i do not know whether ever used the language and the orthography that employs
even if he did it would not weaken the hypothesis of the imitation but if on the other hand it should be ascertained that he did not the hypothesis would be greatly strengthened thereby
as for the speech i am ignorant as to how with what accent and what peculiarities of spoke the tongue and to what degree in consequence his reconstruction by fantasy correctly hits it
if this point could be cleared up it would probably be found to be just like that of the handwriting
nothing could be more natural than to ascribe to the of a very masculine voice and it goes without saying as as possible
it must be noted too that
often heard her father speak that language which he knew very well with several of his friends but that on the other hand she does not speak it and has never learned it
however does not know and turns a deaf ear when any one addresses him in that language
the intonation the attitude the whole physiognomy in short accord with these remarks
as to the extremely varied content of the conversations and messages of we are not obliged to consider as their necessary author
when everything relating to
and the sitters but which has nothing to do with the last century has been swept aside together with the in regard to the fluid manner in which exists perceives and moves the three subjects or categories of communications still remain which merit a rapid examination
in the first place there
are the answers of to the questions put to him concerning his terrestrial life
these answers are remarkably evasive or vague
not a name not a date not a precise fact does he furnish
we only learn that he has travelled extensively suffered greatly studied deeply done much good and healed a great many sick folk but now he sees things too lofty to think any more about historic details of the past and it is with disgust or direct words of reproach for the idle curiosity of his carnal questioners that he to turn the conversation like to moral subjects and those of a lofty philosophy where he feels evidently more at ease
when he is further pressed he becomes angry sometimes and sometimes his ignorance enveloping it meanwhile in an air of profound mystery
they are asking the secret of my life of my acts of my thoughts
i can not answer
this does not facilitate investigation of the question of identity
in the second place come the consultations and medical prescriptions
affects a lofty disdain for modern medicine and acid
he is as archaic in his as in his orthography and treats all maladies after the ancient mode
baths of pressed for rheumatism an infusion of and in white wine for of the chest the bark of the in red wine and of salt water as tonics of hops and other flowers oil of lavender the leaves of the ash
all these do not accord badly with what might have prescribed a century or more ago
the misfortune from the evidential point of view is that
mother is extremely well versed in all the resources of popular medicine where old recipes are perpetuated
she has had occasion to nurse many sick people in her life knows the virtues of different medicinal plants and constantly employs with a which i have often admired a number of those remedies spoken of as which make the young doctors fresh from the clinic smile but to which they will more than once resort in secret after a few years of medical experience
finally there still remain the sentiments of for which he claims are only the continuation of those of for
my ignorance of history does not permit me to pronounce categorically on this point
that the queen of did have some secret interviews with the famous due to simple curiosity or to questions of material interest there is no doubt i believe but that his feelings for his sovereign were a curious combination of the despairing passion of cardinal for the queen with the absolute respect which ascribes to towards appears to me less evident
in short if the revelations of have truly unveiled to us shades of feeling of count hitherto and of which later documentary researches shall confirm the historic so much the better for that will finally establish a trace of the supernormal in the mediumship of
and
the connection between these two personalities is too complex for a precise description
there is neither a mutual exclusion as between mrs and who appear to be ignorant of each other and to be separated by the tightest of partitions nor a simple as in the case of x whose secondary state and the whole primary state
this is more of a crossing of lines but of which the limits are vague and with difficulty
knows and recalls very many things of which the normal personality of
knows absolutely nothing not only of those which she may simply have forgotten but of those of which she never had any consciousness
on the other hand he is far from possessing all the memories of he is ignorant of a very great part of her daily life even some very notable incidents escape him entirely which explains his way of saying that to his great regret he can not remain constantly by her being obliged to occupy himself with other missions concerning which he has never enlightened us which oblige him often to leave her for a time
these two personalities are therefore not each one passes beyond the other at certain points without its being possible for us to say which is on the whole the more extended
as to their common domain if it can not be defined by one word with entire certainty it appears nevertheless to be chiefly constituted by its connection with the innermost ranges of the being both physiological and psychological as might be suspected from what i remarked above concerning the real origin of
physician of the soul and of the body director of conscience and at the same time he does not always manifest himself immediately but he is always present when vital interests are involved
this will be made clearer by two or three concrete examples which will at the same time illustrate some of the psychological processes by which himself to
it must be admitted that there is a disagreement and opposition as complete as possible but how far does this possible go when in at least an apparently waking state with her guide manifestly by a partial sensory or motor for example in the case cited on page where not sharing the of declared by the table that she was wrong so emphatically that she protested and became angry also when in hallucinations or by automatic handwriting he enters into discussion with her and she holds her own with him or again when the organism seems to be divided up between two different persons speaking by mouth with his accent and uttering his own ideas to her and she complaining in writing of pains in her head and throat without understanding their cause
nevertheless in these cases of division of the consciousness which appear to amount to its cutting in two it is doubtful whether this is more than apparent
i am not positive of having ever established with a veritable of different
at the very moment at which writes by her hand speaks by her mouth dictates to the table upon observing her attentively i have always found her absorbed preoccupied as though absent but she instantaneously recovers her presence of mind and the use of her waking faculties at the end of the motor
in short that which from the outside is taken for the coexistence of distinct simultaneous personalities seems to me to be only an alternation a rapid succession between the state of and the state of and in the case where the body seems to be jointly occupied by two independent right side for instance being occupied by and the left by or the psychical division has never seemed to me to be radical but many indications have combined to make me of the opinion that behind all was an individuality perfectly and enjoying thoroughly along with the spectators the comedy of the
a single fundamental personality putting the questions and giving the answers with itself in its own a word enacting all the various of
a fitting interpretation which accords very well with the facts as i have observed them in and very much better than the theory of a of separate of a psychological so to speak
this last theory is doubtless more convenient for a clear and superficial description of the facts but i am not at all convinced that it conforms to the actual condition of affairs
it is a state of consciousness which it is impossible adequately to describe and which can only be represented by the analogy of those curious states exceptional in the normal waking life but less rare in dreams when one seems to change his identity and become some one else
has more than once told me of having had the impression of becoming or being momentarily
this happens most frequently at night or upon awakening in the morning
she has first a fugitive vision of her then it seems that little by little he is submerged in her she feels him overcoming and penetrating her entire organism as if he really became her or she him
these mixed states are extremely interesting to the psychologist unhappily because they generally take place in a condition of consecutive or because the mediums do not know how or do not wish to give a complete account of them it is very rare that detailed descriptions are obtained
between the two extremes of complete and complete unity numerous intermediate states are to be observed or at least since the consciousness of another can not be directly penetrated these mixed states may be inferred from the consequences which spring from them
it has happened for example that believing they were dealing with alone thoroughly and duly substituted for the personality of
the sitters have allowed to escape them on that account some some indiscreet question or too free criticisms all innocent enough and without evil intention but still of a nature to wound if she had heard them and from which the authors would certainly have in her presence in a waking state
has not stood upon ceremony in putting down these and the incident generally has had no further consequences
but sometimes the words and bearing of
for days or weeks afterwards show that she was aware of the remarks which proves that the consciousness of and her own are not separated by an impenetrable barrier but that osmotic changes are effected from the one to the other
it is ordinarily pointed and irritating remarks which cause the trouble which goes to prove that it is the feelings of or personal susceptibility that form in each one of us the fortifications of the social self and are the last to be destroyed by or that they constitute the fundamental substratum the common base by which and
form a whole and mingle themselves in the same individuality
the psychological process of this transmission is varied from another cause
sometimes it appears that the consecutive of the trance has been broken as to the most piquant details and that clearly remembers that which has been said in the presence of disagreeable to herself
some times it is himself who repeats to her the unpleasant expressions which have been used with commentaries calculated to lessen their effect and to excuse the culprits for it is an interesting trait of his character that he undertakes with the of those same persons whom he and a contradiction not at all surprising when it is psychologically interpreted considering the habitual conflict of emotional motives or tendencies the warfare which opposite points of view is incessantly carrying on in our being
sometimes again it is in a dream that the junction is effected between the consciousness of and the normal consciousness of
of the last case here is an example containing nothing disagreeable in which remembered in her waking state a nocturnal dream which was itself a repetition or echo in natural sleep of a scene of the previous evening
in a at which i assisted shortly after my recovery from an attack of congestion of the lungs completely entranced has a vision of who in the of sympathetic physician comes to hold a consultation with me
after some preliminaries she kneels down by my chair and looking alternately at my chest and at the fictitious doctor standing between us she holds a long conversation with him in which she explains the condition of my lungs which she sees in imagination and the treatment which prescribes somewhat as follows paragraph continues

it is the lungs

it is darker

it is one side which has been affected

you say that it is a severe can that be healed

tell me what must be done

oh where have i seen any of these plants

i know what they are called

those

i understand very well

those

oh what a queer name

where are they to be found

you say it belongs to the family of

then it has another name tell me what it is

some sic

then you think this plant is good for him

ah but explain this to me

the fresh leaves or the dried flowers three times a day a large handful in a pint

and then honey and milk

 i will tell him that he must drink three cups a day

 then followed very detailed directions as to treatment various blisters
the whole scene lasted more than an hour followed by complete and nothing was said to about it as it was six in the evening and she was in haste to return home
the next day she wrote me a letter in which she described a very striking dream she had had during the night

 i fell asleep about two in the morning and at about five
was it a vision was it a dream i had i really know what to consider it and dare not say but this i do know i saw my dear friend who spoke to me a long time about you and i think i saw you also
i asked him what he thought of your state of health

 he replied that in his opinion it was far from that the pain you feel in the right side came from an inflammation of the lung which has been seriously affected

you will doubtless laugh when i tell you that he also described the remedies you ought to take

 one of them is a simple plant which is called as nearly as i can remember or but has also another name which i can not recollect but the first name will doubtless suffice since he says you are familiar with the plant

 what i have said concerning is also applicable to the other of
 the normal consciousness of mingles and fuses itself in every way with the consciousness of of or some other incarnation as we shall soon see
i pass now to the examination of some detailed examples destined to throw light upon the which plays in existence
let us begin by listening to himself
among his numerous messages the following letter written in his fine handwriting by the hand of
response to a note in which i had begged him as a spiritual being and distinct from her to aid me in my psychic information for which i had not asked but which was none the less interesting
it must not be forgotten that it is the of who is writing am pleased and touched by the mark of confidence you have deigned to accord me
the spiritual guide of whom the paragraph continues supreme being in his infinite goodness has permitted me to find again with ease i do all i can to appear to her on every occasion when i deem it necessary but my body or if you prefer the matter of little solidity of which i am composed does not always afford me the facility of showing myself to her in a positive human manner
he in fact appeared to her often under the form of elementary visual hallucinations a luminous trail column streamer
that which i seek above all to in her is a consoling and true philosophy which is necessary to her by reason of the profound unhappy impressions which even now still remain to her of the whole drama of her past life
i have often sown bitterness in her heart when she was desiring only her welfare
also laying aside everything superfluous i penetrate into the most hidden of her soul and with an extreme care and incessant activity i seek to implant there those truths which i trust will aid her in attaining the lofty summit of the ladder of perfection
abandoned by my parents front my cradle i have indeed known sorrow early in life
like all i have had many weaknesses which i have and god knows that i bow to his will moral suffering has been my principal lot
i have been full of bitterness of envy of hatred of jealousy
jealousy my brother what a poison what a corruption of the soul nevertheless one ray has shone brightly into my life and that ray so pure so full of everything that might pour on my wounded soul has given me a glimpse of heaven of eternal felicity ray without spot god deemed best to take it before me but it is given back to me may his holy name be blessed friend in what manner shall i reply to you i am ignorant myself not knowing what it will please god to reveal to you but through her whom you call god willing perhaps we shall be able to satisfy you
thy friend we can see under the flowing details of the ideas and his as the repentant that the dominant characteristic of is his deep attachment for
and an ardent moral solicitude for her and her advance towards perfection
this corresponds perfectly with the character of the numerous messages which he addresses to her in the course of her daily existence as may he seen from the following specimen
he is referring to a case where after having warned her on two occasions during the day by hallucinations that he would manifest himself in the evening he gives her in fact by automatic writing in his own hand the encouragement she was actually in need of under the circumstances in which she found herself
one morning at her desk heard an unknown voice stronger and nearer to her than is usual with say to her until this evening a little later the same voice which she now recognized as that of but of a quality rougher and nearer to her than was his habit said to her you understand me well until this evening
in the evening having returned home she was excited at supper left the table in haste towards the end of the meal and shut herself up in her room with the idea that she would learn something but presently the instinctive agitation of her hand indicated to her that she should take her pencil and having done so she obtained in the beautiful calligraphy of the following
she says that she remained wide awake and while writing it and it is the only occasion of a similar character when she had knowledge of the content
my beloved do you vex yourself torment yourself so why are you indignant because as you advance in life you are obliged to acknowledge that all things are not as you had wished and hoped they might be is not the route we follow on this earth always and for all of us strewn with rocks is it not an endless chain of of miseries do me the kindness my dear sister i beg of you to tell me that from this time forth you will cease from endeavoring to probe too deeply the human heart
in what will such discoveries aid you what remains to you of these things except tears and regrets and then this god of love of justice and of not he the one to read our hearts it is for him not for thee to see into them
would you change the hearts would you give them that which they have not a live ardent soul never departing from what is right just and true be calm then in the face of all these little troubles
be worthy and above all always good in thee i have found again that heart and that soul both of which will always be for me all my life all my joy and my only dream here below
believe me be calm reflect that is my wish
thy friend i have chosen this example for the sake of its brevity
has received a number of communications of the same kind sometimes in verse in which the moral and religious note is often still more accentuated
in the greater part we meet with as in the next to the last phrase of the foregoing letter an allusion to the presumed affection of for
it is to be noticed that there is nothing in these excellent admonitions that a high and serious soul like that of
could not have drawn from its own depths in a moment of contemplation and meditation
is it a benefit or an injury to the moral and truly religious life to formulate itself thus clearly in verbal hallucinations rather than to remain in the confused but more personal state of experienced aspirations and strongly expressed emotions do these inspirations gain or lose in inward authority and subjective power by assuming this exterior garb and this aspect of objectivity this is a delicate question probably not susceptible of a uniform solution
in the following incident which i relate as an example among many other similar ones it is no longer properly speaking the moral and religious sentiments personified in but rather the instinct of reserve and of peculiar to the weaker sex the sense of the the with a shade of exaggeration almost amounting to
in a visit to
during which i inquired whether she had received any recent communications from she told me she had only seen him two or three times in the last few days and had been struck by his restless and unhappy air instead of the air so pleasant so sweet so admirable which he generally has
as she did not know to what to attribute this change of countenance i advised her to take her pencil and to wrap herself in meditation with the hope of obtaining some automatic message
in about a minute her expression indicated that she was being taken possession of her eyes were fixed on the paper upon which her left hand rested the thumb and little finger being agitated and continually tapping about once a second the right hand having tried to take the pencil between the index and middle finger the manner of ended by it between the thumb and the index finger and traced slowly in the handwriting of yes i am restless pained even in anguish
paragraph continues thou friend that it is with satisfaction that i see you every day accepting the attentions the i do not call them insincere but of little worth and little on the part of those from whom they come
this text was written at six separate times marked by the vertical bars separated by brief moments of full wakefulness when the of the left hand ceased and when repeating in a loud voice what she was about to write is very much astonished does not know to what alludes then at my request takes her pencil to obtain an explanation and falls asleep again during the following fragment
at the end of this bit as she persists in saying that she is ignorant of what he refers to i proceed to question who replies that for several days has permitted herself to be courted by a m v perfectly honorably who often found himself on the same streetcar with her had made a place for her beside him the last few mornings and had paid her some compliments on her appearance
these revelations excited the laughter and protestations of who commenced to deny that it could have come from and accused me of having suggested it to her little finger but the right hand took the pencil and traced these words in the handwriting and with the signature of i only say what i think and i desire that you refuse henceforth all the flowers that he may offer youleopold
this time remembered the incident and recollected that yesterday morning he had offered her a rose which he was wearing as a
eight days later i paid another visit to and after an effort to secure some handwriting which was not successful but resulted in a vision see text no
she had a visual of and losing consciousness of the actual environment and of my presence also as well as that of her mother she flung herself into a running conversation with him in regard to the incident of eight days previously


 come near me him
you are too severe

will you come on i am going to be at m next
you will be there

but take good care that you do not

no it is not kind of you always to disclose secrets

 what must he have thought

you seem to make a mountain out of a

 and who would think of refusing a flower you understand at all

 why then it was a very simple thing to accept it a matter of no importance whatever

to refuse it would have been

 you pretend to read the heart

 why give importance to a thing that amounts to nothing

it is only a simple act of friendship a little token of sympathy

to make me write such things on paper before everybody not nice of you in this dialogue in which we can divine replies took for the moment the accent of see below in the royal cycle
to awaken her who had possession of arms made some passes over her forehead then pressed the frontal and nerves of the left side and made me a sign to do the same with those of the right
the of the next day but one at my house passed without any allusion by to the incident of the streetcar evidently on account of the presence of certain sitters to whom he did not wish to reveal secrets
but three days after in a new visit during which she told me of having had a waking discussion concerning the future life without telling me with whom she again wrote in the hand of it is not in such society as this that you ought so seriously to discuss the immortality of the soul
she then confessed that it was again on the streetcar and with m v that she had held that conversation while a funeral procession was passing
there was never anything that might have been of a compromising character in the exchange of and the occasional conversations of
with her neighbor of the streetcar
the trouble that it caused poor was very characteristic of him and well indicated the severe and jealous who formerly had worried the n group there can be heard again the echo of that voice which has absolutely nothing to do with the conscience see
and and which has hitherto prevented from accepting any of the suitors whom she has encountered in the course of her journey through life
this austere and rigorous mentor always wide awake and taking at the least freedom which
allows herself in the exchange of trifling represents in fact a very common psychological attribute it is not every feminine soul that carries stored in one of its where it its presence by more or less vaguely felt certain or apprehensions inhibiting feelings or tendencies of a shade of intensity varying according to the age and the temperament
it is not my part to describe this delicate phenomenon
it me to remark that here as in the messages the personality of has in no way aided the essential content of those inward experiences of which
is perfectly capable by herself the form only of their manifestation has gained in picturesque and dramatic expression in the of the automatic and of the dialogue
it seems as though the suggestive approach of my presence and my questions had been necessary to excite these phenomena it is however very probable to judge from other examples that my influence only hastened the explosion of in formulated reproaches and that his latent discontent hitherto noticed in the restless and suffering air of his fugitive visual would have terminated after a period of incubation more or less prolonged in breaking out into spontaneous admonitions or written
it can be that in this of vigilant guardian of an almost excessive for the honor or the dignity of
is again to my mind only a product of psychological duplication
he represents a certain grouping of inward desires and secret instincts which the predisposition encouraged by has brought into a peculiar prominence and given an aspect of foreign personality in the same way in the of the dream certain almost unperceived while awake rise to the first plane and become transformed into contradictory fictitious personages whose cutting reproaches us sometimes on awakening by their disturbing truthfulness
a final example will show us in his of over the health of
and adviser of precautions which she ought to take
he is not troubled about her general health when she had la for instance or when she is simply worn out with fatigue he scarcely shows himself
his attention is concentrated upon certain special physiological functions of the normal exercise of which he takes care to be assured
he does not otherwise seem to exercise a positive action upon them and can not modify them in any way his office seems to be confined to knowing beforehand their exact course and to see that is not guilty of any which may them
here shows a knowledge and prevision of the most intimate phenomena of the organism which has been observed in the case of secondary personalities and which confers upon them in that respect at least an unquestionable advantage over the ordinary personality
in the case of
the indications of her guide are always of a prohibitive nature calculated to prevent her from taking part in reunions at a time at which she believes herself able to do so with impunity but which he endowed with a more refined sensibility thinks she ought not to undertake
he has for several years formally laid his ban upon every kind of mediumistic exercises at certain very regular periods
he has also on numerous occasions compelled her by various messages categorical hallucinations diverse impulses of the arms forcing her to write
to modify her plans and to abandon already arranged
this is a very clear form of teleological
as a specimen of this spontaneous and intervention of in the life of i have selected the letter given below because it combines several interesting traits
it well the energy with which
is compelled to obey her guide
the passage from the to the graphic form of is also to be noticed in it
of this in the page of this letter reproduced in fig
see p it is made clear that the transition of the hand of to that of is accomplished brusquely and in a decided manner
the handwriting is not metamorphosed gradually slowly but continues to be that of
becoming more and more agitated it is true and rendered almost by the shocks to the arm of which takes hold up to the moment when suddenly and by a bound it becomes the calligraphy of
 am awoke about ten minutes ago and heard the voice of telling me in a very imperious manner get up out of your bed and quickly very quickly write to your dear friend m that you will not hold a tomorrow and that you will not be able to go to his house for two weeks and that you will not hold any within that period
i have executed his order having felt myself forced compelled in spite of myself to obey
i was so comfortable in bed and so vexed at being obliged to write you such a message but i feel myself forced to do what he bids me
at this moment i am looking at my watch it is
 i feel a very strong shock in my right might better speak of it as an electric which i perceive has made me
write crooked
i hear also at this instant the voice of
i have much difficulty in writing what he tells me
 say to him this i am sir always your very devoted servant in body and mind healthy and not unbalanced
i stopped for some moments after writing these words which i saw very well after having written them were in the handwriting of
immediately afterwards a second disturbance similar to the first gave me a fresh shock this time from my feet to my head
it all passed so quickly that i am disturbed and confused by it
it is true that i am not yet quite well
is this the reason why prevents my going to tomorrow i do not know but nevertheless am anxious to follow his advice


always submits to the commands of her guide since whenever she has transgressed them through forgetfulness or neglect she has had cause to repent it
it is clear that in this of special physician of
always of her state of health could easily be interpreted as personifying those vague impressions which spring forth continually from the depths of our physical being informing us as to what is passing there
a is felt in a dream hours before it makes itself felt in our waking consciousness while some maladies are often thus several days before they actually declare themselves
all literature is full of anecdotes of this kind and the psychiatrists have observed that in the form of circular alienation where phases of depression and maniacal alternately succeed one another more or less regularly with intervals of normal equilibrium it is frequently in sleep that the first symptoms of the change of humor can be detected which has already begun in the depths of the individuality but will only break forth on the outside a little later
but all the states are connected and it is not at all surprising that in the case of a subject inclined to these confused should arise with the appearance of a foreign personality which is only a degree higher than the process of dramatization already so brilliantly at work in our ordinary dreams
it will be useless to lengthen or further multiply examples of the intervention of in the life of
 those which i have given show him under his essential aspects and suffice to justify confidence in a guide who has never deceived her who has always given her the best counsel delivered discourses of the highest ethical tone and manifested the most touching solicitude for her physical and moral health
it is easy to understand that nothing can shake her faith in the real objective existence of this precious
it is really vexatious that the phenomena of dreams should be so little observed or so badly understood i do not say by psychologists but by the general public which prides itself on its psychology since the dream is the prototype of messages and holds the key to the explanation of mediumistic phenomena
if it is regrettable to see such noble sympathetic pure and in all respects remarkable personalities as reduced to the rank of a dream creation it must be remembered however that dreams are not always as idle folk think things to be despised or of no value in themselves the majority are insignificant and deserve only the oblivion to which they are promptly consigned
a very large number are bad and sometimes even worse than reality but there are others of a better sort and dream is often a synonym for ideal
to sum up certainly expresses in his central nucleus a very honorable and attractive side of the character of
and in taking him as her guide she only follows inspirations which are probably among the best of her nature
the title of this book would naturally commit me to a review of the romance before investigating the cycle
considerations of method have caused me to reverse this order
it is better to advance from the simple to the complex and while we certainly know less concerning the planet mars than of the romance which it has inspired in the genius of
is relatively less difficult to explain than the oriental cycle
in fact the former seems to spring from pure imagination while in the latter we meet with certain actual historical elements and whence memory and intelligence have gained a knowledge of them is an extremely difficult problem for us to solve
there is then only one faculty at work in the romance as a professional psychologist would say while the oriental cycle calls several into play making it necessary to treat of it later on account of its greater psychological complexity
while the unknown language which forms the vehicle of many of the messages can not naturally be dissociated from the rest of the cycle it merits nevertheless a special consideration and the following chapter will be entirely devoted to it
it does not figure in the present chapter in which i shall treat of the origin and the content only of the romance
i origin and birth of the cycle we dare to hope says m at the beginning of his excellent work on the planet mars that the day will come when scientific methods yet unknown to us will give us direct evidences of the existence of the inhabitants of other worlds and at the same time also will put us in communication with our brothers in space
and on the last page of his book he to the same idea and says what marvels does not the science of the future reserve for our successors and who would dare to say that humanity and terrestrial humanity will not some day enter into communication with each other this splendid prospect seems still far off along with that of telegraphy and almost an utopian dream so long as one holds strictly to the current conceptions of our positive sciences
but break these narrow limits fly for example towards the horizon which opens up to its happy followers and as soon as this vague hope takes shape nothing seems to prevent its immediate realization and the only cause for wonder is found in the fact that no privileged medium has yet arisen to have the glory unique in the world of being the first intermediary between ourselves and the human inhabitants of other planets for takes no more account of the barrier of space than of time
the gates of distance are wide open before it
with it the question of means is a secondary matter one has only the embarrassment of making a choice
it matters not whether it be by intuition by clairvoyance by telepathy or by double personality that the soul is permitted to leave momentarily its terrestrial prison and make the voyage between this world and others in an instant of time or whether the feat is accomplished by means of the astral body by the of by fluid beings or in a word by any other process whatever
the essential point is according to that no serious objection would be offered to the possibility of such communication
the only difficulty would be to find a mediumistic subject possessing sufficient psychical faculties
it is a simple question of fact if such a one has not yet been found it is apparently only because the time is not yet ripe
but now that themselves appeal to those unknown methods of actual science to put us en rapport with other worlds no doubt is the science of tomorrow as definite as absolute soon respond to these legitimate aspirations
we may therefore expect at any moment the revelation so impatiently looked for and every good medium has the right to ask herself whether she is not the being predestined to accomplish this mission
these are the considerations which to my mind in their essential content inspired in the part of
the first idea of her romance
i would not assert that the passages from m which i have quoted came directly to the notice of but they express and recapitulate wonderfully well one of the elements of the atmosphere in which she found herself at the beginning of her mediumship
for if there are no certain indications of her ever having read any work on the heavenly worlds and their inhabitants either that of m or of any other author she has nevertheless heard such subjects discussed
she is perfectly familiar with the name of the celebrated astronomical writer and knows something of his philosophical ideas which is not at all surprising when we consider the popularity he enjoys among who find in him a very strong scientific support for their doctrine of on other planets
i also have evidence that in the circle of
n of which was a member in the conversation more than once turned in the direction of the of mars to which the discovery of the famous canals has for some years specially directed the attention of the general public
this circumstance appears to me to explain sufficiently the fact that astronomy should be concerned with this planet
it is moreover quite possible that the first germs of the romance date still further back than the beginning of mediumship
the oriental shows indications of concerning itself with that planet and the very clear impression which she has of having in her childhood and youth experienced many visions of a similar kind without her noticing them particularly gives rise to the that the ingredients of which this cycle is composed date from many years back
possibly they may have one and the same primitive source in the exotic memories descriptions or pictures of tropical countries which later branched out under the vigorous of ideas in two distinct currents the romance on the one side and the on the other whose waters are mingled on more than one occasion afterwards
while on the whole therefore it is probable that its roots extend back as far as the childhood of
it is nevertheless with the romance as well as with the others not a mere question of the simple return of facts of a remote past or of an of brought to light again by the aid of
it is a very active process and one in full course of evolution nourished undoubtedly by elements belonging to the past but which have been and in a very original fashion until it amounts finally among other things to the creation of an unknown language
it will be interesting to follow step by step the phases of this elaboration but since it always unfortunately hides itself in the obscurity of the we are only cognizant of it by its occasional appearances and all the rest of that work must be inferred in a manner somewhat hypothetical from those and the scanty data which we have concerning the outward influences which have exerted a stimulating influence upon the part of
it was in then that the conversations took place which were to prepare the soil for this work of lofty fantasy and planted in mind the double idea of enormous scientific interest that she could enter into direct relation with the inhabitants of mars and of the possibility by scientists but which furnishes us of reaching there by a mediumistic route
i doubt however whether that vague suggestion on the part of the environment would have to engender the for more than two years no sign of its eruption the intervention of some fillip more concrete capable of giving a start to the whole movement
it is not easy unfortunately for want of records of the facts to assign with precision the circumstances under which and the moment when subconscious imagination received that effective but an trace is discovered as i am about to show in the report of the proceedings of the first distinctly of
 in march made the acquaintance of m who being exceedingly interested in the phenomena of abnormal psychology was present with others at some of her and finally begged her to hold some at his house
at the first of these paragraph continues met a lady a widow who was greatly to be pitied
besides suffering from a very serious affection of the eyes
had been terribly afflicted by the loss of her only son seventeen years old and a pupil of m
while not yet fully convinced of the truth of it is easy to understand that
was very anxious to believe in that doctrine and ready to accept it if only some could be furnished her and what more convincing testimony could she ask or receive than that of a message from her beloved child moreover it was probably not without a secret hope of a communication of this nature that she accepted the invitation which m had sent her with the idea of some moments of distraction for the unhappy mother as happens frequently in case this first fully satisfied the desires of the sitters and surpassed their expectations
speaking only of that which concerns
had the vision first of a young man in the very detailed description of whom there was no difficulty in recognizing the deceased then of an old man whom the table called brought by the young man that he might treat his mothers eyes who thus had the double privilege of receiving through
the table words of tenderness from her son and from directions for the treatment of the affection of her eyes
nothing in that recalled in any way the planet mars and it could not be foreseen from anything that occurred there that would return later under the name of as official interpreter of the language
it was altogether different a month later at the second reunion at m at which
was again present
on this occasion the astronomical dream appeared at once and dominated the entire
from the beginning says the report of the
perceived in the distance and at a great height a bright light
then she felt a tremor which almost caused her heart to cease beating after which it seemed to her as though her head were empty and as if she were no longer in the body
she found herself in a dense fog which changed successively from blue to a vivid rose color to gray and then to black she is floating she says and the table supporting itself on one leg seemed to express a very curious floating movement
then she sees a star growing larger always larger
and becomes finally as large as our house
feels that she is ascending then the table gives by that which you have so long desired
who had been ill at ease finds herself feeling better she distinguishes three enormous globes one of them very beautiful
on what am i walking she asks
and the table replies on a
then began a description of all the strange things which presented themselves to her view and caused her as much surprise as amusement
carriages without horses or wheels emitting sparks as they glided by houses with fountains on the roof a cradle having for curtains an angel made of iron with wings
what seemed less strange were people exactly like the inhabitants of our earth save that both sexes wore the same costume formed of trousers very ample and a long blouse drawn tight about the waist and decorated with various designs
the child in the cradle was exactly like our children according to the sketch which made from memory after the
finally she saw upon mars a sort of vast assembly hall in which was professor having in the first row of his hearers the young who by a his mother for not having followed the medical prescription which he gave her a month previously dear have you then so little confidence in us you have no idea how much pain you have caused me then followed a conversation of a private nature between
and her son the latter replying by means of the table then everything becomes quiet the vision of mars effaces itself little by little the table takes the same rotary movement on one foot which it had at the commencement of the
finds herself again in the and goes through the same process as before in an inverse order
then she exclaims ah here i am back again and several loud on the table mark the end of the
i have related in its principal elements this first for the sake of its importance in different respects
the initial series of hallucinations corresponding to a voyage from the earth to mars reflects well the childish character of an imagination which scientific problems or the exigencies of logic trouble very little
without doubt can explain how the material difficulties of an interplanetary journey may be avoided in a purely mediumistic fluid connection but why then this persistence of physical sensations trouble with the heart tremor floating sensation
however it may be this series of sensations is from this time on the customary prelude and as it were the premonitory aura of the dream with certain modifications throughout all the sometimes it is complicated with hallucinations rumbling noise of rushing water
or sometimes disagreeable odors of burning of sulphur of a coming storm oftener it tends to shorten and simplify itself until it is either reduced to a brief feeling of malaise or to the initial visual of the light generally very brilliant and red in which the visions usually appear
but the point to which i wish to call special attention is that singular speech of the table on the instant at which
arrives on the distant star and before it is known what star is concerned that which you have so much wished for this declaration which may be considered as a dedication so to speak inscribed on the of the romance authorizes us in my opinion in considering it and interpreting it in its origin as a direct answer to a wish of m a desire which came at a recent period to paragraph continues knowledge and which has enacted with her the of her astronomical dream
it is true that m himself did not understand at the moment to what this preliminary warning referred but the note which he inserted at the end of his report of that is instructive in this regard i do not know how to explain the first words dictated by the table that which you have so much wished for m s reminds me that in a conversation which i had with him last summer i said to him it would be very interesting to know what is happening upon other planets
if this is an answer to the wish of last year very well
it must be added that m s who had been sufficiently struck by this wish of m to remember it for several months was during all of the time referred to one of the most regular attendants upon the of
and to one who knows by experience all that happens at the reunions before after and during the itself there could hardly be any doubt but that it was through m s as intermediary that
had heard mentioned m regret at our relative ignorance of the inhabitants of other planets
this idea probably caught on the wing during the state of suggestibility which accompanies the returned with renewed force when was invited to hold a at the house of m and made more vivid also by the desire which is always latent in her of making the visions as interesting as possible to the persons among whom she finds herself
such is in my opinion the seed which falling into the ground and fertilized by former conversations concerning the inhabitants of mars and the possibility of relations with them has served as the germ of the romance the further development of which it remains for me to trace
one point which still remains to be cleared up in the as i come to sum up is the singularly artificial character and the slight connection between the vision properly so called and the reappearance of and
we do not altogether understand what these personages have to do with it
what need is there of their being today found on the planet mars simply for the purpose of continuing their interview with
begun at a previous without the intervention of any planet the at which they are found while it is located on mars is a bond of union all the more artificial between them and that planet in that there is nothing specifically in its description and appears to have been borrowed from our globe
this incident is at bottom a matter out of the regular course full of interest undoubtedly for
whom it directly concerns but without intimate connection with the world
it was evidently the astronomical revelation intended for m and ripened by a period of incubation which should have furnished the material for this but the presence of
awoke anew the memory of her son and of which had occupied the preceding and these memories interfering with the vision become for good or ill incorporated as a strange episode in it without having any direct connection with it
the work of unification of dramatization by which these two unequal chains of ideas are and fused the one with the other through the of an is no more or no less extraordinary than that which displays itself in all our nocturnal where certain absolutely heterogeneous memories often ally themselves after an unexpected fashion and afford opportunity for confusions of the most bizarre character
but mediumistic communications differ from ordinary dreams in the of the latter does not cause them to have any consequences
we are astonished and diverted for a moment as we reflect upon a dream
sometimes a dream holds a little longer the attention of the psychologist who endeavors to unravel the intricate plot of his dreams and to discover amid the of association or the events of the waking state the origin of their tangled threads
but on the whole this has no influence on the ultimate course of our thoughts because we see in our dreams only the results of chance without value in themselves and without objective
it is otherwise with communications by reason of the importance and the credit accorded them
the medium who partially her or to whom the sitters have detailed them after the close of the adding also their comments becomes preoccupied with these mysterious revelations like the paranoiac who perceives hidden meanings or a profound significance in the most trifling coincidences she seeks to fathom the content of her strange visions reflects on them examines them in the light of notions if she encounters difficulties in them or contradictions her conscious or unconscious thought the two are not always in accord will undertake the task of removing them and solving as well as possible the problems which these considered as realities impose upon her and the later will bear the imprint of this labor of interpretation or correction
it is to this point we have come at the commencement of the astronomical romance of
 the purely accidental and conjunction of the planet mars and in the of the of determined their definitive welding together
association by is transformed into a logical connection
 later development of the cycle this development was not effected in a regular manner but for the most part by leaps and bounds separating stoppages more or less prolonged
after its inauguration in the of it suffered a first eclipse of nearly fifteen months attributable to new preoccupations which had installed themselves on the highest plane of
and held that position throughout the whole of the year
compared with the of that of of which a follows shows interesting innovations
does not figure in it and henceforth does not appear again which was probably due to the fact that
had failed to make use of the method of treatment which he had prescribed for her eyes
young on the contrary sole object of the desires and longings of his poor mother occupies the highest plane and is the central figure of the vision
he now speaks and no longer understands which the conversation somewhat
further not possessing the power of moving tables upon our globe it is through the intervention of the medium by himself momentarily in
that he henceforth with his mother
these two latter points in their turn cause certain difficulties to arise which acting as a ferment or a suggestion will later usher in a new step in the progress of the romance can not return to incarnate himself in a terrestrial medium if he is imprisoned in his existence he must first terminate that and return to the condition in which he again floats in interplanetary space which fluid or wandering state permits him at the same time to give us the translation of the tongue since according to a complete memory of previous and consequently of the various languages pertaining to them is temporarily recovered during the phases of
these anticipatory hints will assist the reader in following more easily the thread of the romance in the of its principal stages
i sum up by them the principal phases of this which lasted more than two hours and a half and at which
assisted
i increasing with gradual loss of consciousness of the real the beginning the table bows several times to
announcing that the coming scene is intended for her
after a series of elementary visual hallucinations rainbow colors
meaning for
that she would finally become blind arose left the table and held a long conversation with an imaginary woman who wished her to enter a curious little car without wheels or horses
she became impatient towards this woman who after having at first spoken to her in now persisted in speaking in an unintelligible tongue like
revealed to us by the little finger that it was the language of the planet mars that this woman is the mother of reincarnated on that planet and that herself will speak
presently begins to recite with increasing an incomprehensible jargon the beginning of which is as follows according to notes taken by m at the time as accurately as possible

from this point the rapidity prevented the recognition of anything else except such scraps as




or



after a few minutes paragraph continues herself crying out oh i have had enough of it you say such words to me i will never be able to repeat them
then with some reluctance she to follow her into the car which was to carry her to mars
 the trance is now complete
thereupon the voyage to mars in three phases the meaning of which is indicated by a regular rocking motion of the upper part of the body passing through the terrestrial atmosphere absolute immobility and rigidity interplanetary space again of the shoulders and the bust atmosphere of mars
arrived upon mars she descends from the car and performs a complicated pantomime expressing the manners of politeness gestures with the hands and fingers slapping of the hands taps of the fingers upon the nose the lips the chin
twisted and rotation on the floor
it seems that is the way people approach and salute each other up there
 this sort of dance having suggested to one of the sitters the idea of performing upon the piano suddenly fell upon the floor in an evidently hypnotic state which had no longer a character
at the cessation of the music she entered into a mixed state in which the memory of the visions continually mingle themselves with some idea of her terrestrial existence
she talks to herself
those dreams are all the same

 i must tell that to m
when he the said to me he tapped himself upon the nose

 he spoke to me in a queer language but i understood it perfectly all the same
seated on the ground leaning against a piece of furniture she continues in in a low voice to review the dream mingling with it some wandering reflections
she finds for example that the young was a remarkably big boy for one only five or six years old as he claimed to be and that the woman seemed very young to be his mother
 after a phase of sighs and followed by profound sleep with muscular relaxation she enters into and some confused words

 i command her to speak to me she seems to understand and replies in with an irritated and imperious tone i ask her to tell me her name she replies
with the idea that perhaps she is the young of whom she has spoken so much in the preceding phase i urge
to approach her and thereupon begins a scene of incarnation really very affecting
is on her knees sobbing bitterly in the presence of her recovered son who shows her marks of the most profound affection and caresses her hands exactly as he was accustomed to do during his last illness all the time carrying on a discourse in tin is which the poor mother can not understand but to which an accent of extreme sweetness and a tender intonation impart an evident meaning of words of consolation and filial tenderness
this pathetic duet lasted about ten minutes and was brought to an end by a return to sleep from which awakened at the end of a quarter of an hour pronouncing a short word after which she instantly recovered the use of her and her normal waking state
 questioned as to what had passed while drinking tea the dream which she has had
she has a sufficiently clear memory of her journey and of what she has seen on mars with the exception of the young man of whom she has retained only a recollection of the scene of incarnation
but suddenly in the midst of the conversation she begins to speak in without appearing to be aware of it and while continuing to chat with us in the most natural manner she appeared to understand all our words and answered in her strange idiom in the most normal tone and seemed very much astonished when we told her that we did not understand her language she evidently believes she is speaking
by questioning her concerning a visit which she had made a few days before to m c and asking her the number and the names of the persons whom she met there we succeed in identifying the four following words s s c c four
after which she her
as to the incident which has transpired she is astounded has only a hesitating and confused memory of her having spoken at all this evening of her visit to m c and does not recognize nor understand the four words given above when they are repeated to her
on several occasions during this i had made the suggestion to that at a given signal after her she would recover the memory of the words pronounced by her and of their meaning
but who was present declared that this command would not be obeyed and that a translation could not be obtained this evening
the signal though often repeated was in fact without result
it has seemed to me necessary to describe with some detail this at which the language made its first appearance in order to place before the reader all the fragments which we have been able to gather without of course any guarantee of absolute accuracy since every one knows how difficult it is to note the sounds of unknown words
a curious difference is to be noticed between the words picked up in the course of the and the four words several times repeated by the meaning and of which have been determined with complete accuracy in the return of the dream
judged by these latter the language is only a puerile counterfeit of of which she preserves in each word a number of syllables and certain conspicuous letters
in the other phrases on the contrary also making use of later texts which have been translated as we shall see hereafter it can not be discovered what it is
we are constrained to believe that these first outbreaks of characterized by a which we have rarely met with since then was only a a continuation of sounds uttered at random and without any real meaning analogous to the which children use sometimes in their games of pretending to speak or and that the real was only created by an distortion of in a access of in order to respond to the manifest desire of the sitters to obtain the precise significance of some isolated words
the impossibility announced by of a translation that same evening of the pretended spoken for the first time during that and the fact that it could not again be obtained give some support to the preceding theory
the circumstance that in remembering her dream in phase no
had the sentiment of having well understood this unknown jargon is not an objection since the children who amuse themselves by an recur to that not retain the least consciousness of the ideas which their is assumed to express
it seems in short that if this new language was already really established at that time in consciousness to the point of sustaining fluently discourses of several minutes duration some phrases at least would not have failed to gush forth spontaneously sometimes in the course of ordinary life and in order to throw light upon visions of people or landscapes
more than seven months had to elapse before that phenomenon which was so frequent afterwards began to appear
may we not see in this a period of incubation employed in the fabrication of a language properly so is to say formed of precise words and with a definite in imitation of the four terms just referred toto replace the disordered nonsense of the beginning however it may be and to return to our story one can imagine the interest which that sudden and unexpected apparition of mysterious speech aroused and which the authority of would not allow to be taken for anything other than the language of mars
the natural curiosity of herself as well as that of her friends to know more about our neighbors of other worlds and their way of expressing themselves should naturally have contributed to the development of the dream
the following unhappily did not justify the promise with which it began
at the beginning of this has a vision of who announces by means of the table that he has not forgotten his and that he will give a translation of the words another day
but this prediction is not fulfilled
whether for the reason that she is not feeling well today or that the presence of some one to her has hindered the production of the phenomena the which seemed on the point of breaking forth did not make its appearance
remains in a state in which the feeling of present reality and the ideas on the level of consciousness interfere with and mutually obscure each other she speaks in with the sitters but mingling with it here and there a strange word such as which according to the context seem to signify pencil ring paper and appears far away from her actual surroundings
she is astonished in particular at the sight of m r occupied in taking notes by the verbal and seems to find that manner of writing with a pen or pencil strange and absurd but without explaining clearly how it was to be otherwise accomplished
the importance of this is in the fact that the idea stands out clearly which was not to be realized until a year and a half later of a mode of handwriting peculiar to the planet mars
this which was almost a failure was the last of that period
health which became more and more impaired by standing too long on her feet and at her desk necessitated her taking a complete rest
i have mentioned the fact that during these six months without any regular she was subject to a of spontaneous visions and but these belonged to the or other cycles and i do not believe that she experienced during that time any phenomena which were clearly related to the romance
on the other hand as soon as she was in and had returned to her normal mode of life the latter appeared again with all the more intensity dating from the following nocturnal vision
see fig
 hlne that having arisen at a three in the morning to take in some flowers that stood upon the and were threatened by the wind instead of going back to bed immediately she sat down upon her bed and saw before her a landscape and some peculiar people
she was on the border of a beautiful lake with a bridge the sides of which were transparent and formed of yellow tubes like the pipes of an organ of which one end seemed to be plunged into the water
the earth was some of the trees had trunks as they ascended while those of others were twisted
later a crowd approached the bridge in which one woman was especially prominent
the women wore hats which were flat like plates
does not know who these people are but has the feeling of having with them
on the bridge there was a man of dark complexion carrying in his hands an instrument somewhat resembling a in appearance which being pressed emitted flames and which seemed to be a
by means of this instrument the man left the bridge touched the surface of the water and returned again to the bridge
this tableau lasted minutes since upon returning to consciousness observed that her candle was still burning and ascertained that it was then
 she is convinced that she did not fall asleep but was wide awake during all of this vision
see
and
from that time the spontaneous visions are repeated and multiplied
 experiences them usually in the morning after and before rising from her bed sometimes in the evening or occasionally at other times during the day
it is in the course of these visual hallucinations that the language appears again under an form
during these last days has seen again on different occasions the man with or without his for example he appeared to her while she was taking a bath at the edge of the bathtub
she has had several times visions of a strange house the picture of which followed her with so much that she finally painted it see fig
 at the same time she heard on three different occasions a sentence the meaning of which she does not know but which she was able to take down with her pencil as follows n t k
as was ascertained six weeks after by the translation given in the of the of this phrase indicates that the strange house is that of the man who is called
this phrase was undoubtedly but what was the meaning of it after having hoped in vain for nearly a month that the meaning would be revealed in some way or other i decided to try a disguised suggestion
i wrote to himself a letter in which i appealed to his as well as to his kindness to give me some enlightenment in regard to the strange language which our curiosity and in particular as to the meaning of the phrase had heard
i asked him to answer me in writing by means of hand
we did not have to wait long for a reply
received my letter the of and on the evening of the seized with a vague desire to write she took a pencil which placed itself in the regular position between the thumb and the whereas she always held her pen between the middle and and traced rapidly in the characteristic handwriting of and with his signature a beautiful of eighteen lines addressed to me of which the ten last are as follows being an answer to my request that the secrets of be revealed to me i was working in the studio of when i heard a great laugh behind me
if ever there was derision in a laugh there was derision in this one
i flung down my gaudy brushes and my palette and turned about in a find the master himself his red cave of a mouth wide open in his black beard
i cooled my temper with an effort for great indeed is master artist of sub
i am sorry he gasped but i cant control my laughter
no one ever has conceived much less executed anything worse than what you have put upon canvas what do you call it in a convulsive nightmare but could control himself i was sure
it is one of the things i have learned of the really great in the arts they make no pretenses
he was laughing because he wanted to tell me frankly what he thought of my ability as an artist
it is bad enough when your friends mock your work and they had but when the master is convulsed with laughter it is high time to wake up to the truth
it is true great i said humbly
i want to paint but i can not
i the ability
expression softened
he smiled and as he smiled it was as though he had turned on the sunlight
go he said go to the deeper at center
once there study science learn to mix the potions that give the brain greater awareness a better rate of growth
he patted my shoulder and added a last bit of advice
once you have mixed the potions take them
drink grow he passed on still
why is the truth always so brutal or does it just seem brutal when it comes from those wiser than you i from the studio but i had already determined to take his advice
i would go to city at center
i would go to the science schools of the
never before had i considered leaving sub my birthplace or as i should express it my growth place for i am a culture man a product of the laboratories
in fact i remember no other place on although it is a fact that during the process of my development to culture manhood i roamed the culture forests of which is the name for surface
sub is just below while city is located at the center of at a great depth below sub
the walls of the great cavern in which city is located are hardened to untellable strength by treatment with which feed its growth until it is of great density
there are many other cities which grew through the centuries to vast size but none so great as city
some are abandoned but all are indestructible their cavern walls too dense to penetrate or to collapse
since city is located near the center of mother gravity itself by opposition
it is very comfortable
many of the live there and in fact it is almost a city
there also are the mighty ones the elders of the races government
huge they are like great trees many centuries old and still growing
i had long wished to see them and now that i had decided to go the thrill was greater than any i had ever experienced i was going down into the city of many wonders out on the street i took one of the many vehicles that are provided for travel about the city
these vehicles their weight reduced by a gravity device are powered by motors whose energy is derived from a gravity focusing magnetic field by which one side of a becomes much heavier than the other
this is accomplished by bending gravity fall in the same way that a lens bends a light ray
the buildings of sub fled by me and soon i neared the squat entrance to the shafts that fell from sub to center to city home of the
i knew that swift dropped down these shafts but i had never traveled in one of them
because i knew the of one of the having talked with him often of city and the wonders he had seen in it i went to his shaft for my descent
he was glad to see me and very much surprised to learn that i was going to city
you will never regret it he declared
the car dropped so swiftly that a great fear grew in me that i would be crushed by deceleration when we finally stopped
in panic i watched an indicators two hands move slowly toward each other as though to cover its face in shame
then with little sensation the car stopped
here at the center of i had become nearly and the ceasing of even such swift motion did not have ill effects upon my body
i knew that i would not have that fear again
two fat stepped out of the car ahead of me sighing with relief at their renewed weightlessness which they had obviously been anticipating
as i was about to follow them from the car the drew me aside
fear rides the ways down here he whispered his catlike ears quivering an alert
fear is a smell down here that is ever in the bad smell too
try to figure it out while you are down here and tell me too if you get an answer
i did not understand what he meant but i promised anyway
the smell of fear in city immediately i was immersed in the shocking appeal of a crowd mostly at this hour a shopping rush of female
while there were many of my own type and of the elevator type there were a greater number of creatures of every shape the mind could grasp and some that it could not
all were citizens all were animate and of every race that space crossing had ever brought into contact from planets whose very names are now lost in time
the may have been wrong in the opinion of some when they developed breeding but they have certainly given life variety
i had never seen so many before
at a corner of the vastly way where many platforms crossed and each other i stepped to a and dialed the student center
the image of a tremendous female filled the screen and the electrically augmented body appeal of the mighty life within her seized the youth in me and it as no embrace from lesser female ever had
and what her voice shook me as a leaf in an organ pipe might a pale and puny male like you want in city you look as if you never had enough to eat as if love had passed you by
did you come down here because no one wanted you elsewhere i grinned back at her image my voice a feeble piping in comparison to hers
i have come to learn something beside drawing lines around dreams
i am a painter from the subsurface who has decided that knowledge of actual growth is more important than the false growth of an untrue image upon a canvas
i wondered what the master would have said to hear me
you are right she boomed back her six arms engaged in complex wand mysterious movements picking up and laying down instruments and tools in rapidity her attention elsewhere yet enough remaining on me to hold me bound in an attraction as strong as a cable
she was a forty foot her age
as i thought upon this and tried not to think of the immense beauty and life force of her i suddenly realized she was hiding fear
i have a peculiar faculty for sensing hidden emotions
that bluff greeting had been a hidden wish to drive me from some danger
but i did not speak of it for i read that caution in her a very strong mental flow that fairly screamed
this kind of fear was a wonder and a new thing to me for danger was a thing long banished from our life
then she spoke reluctantly it seemed
go to the center of the hall of symbols
there you can ask a student or an instructor who will tell you all you need to know
the grip of the woman life in her left my mind and she was gone from my vision
as i turned from the my mind insisted on that embrace and its probable effect upon a man in love
i shivered in spite of the warmth but not from fear
the blood of the was alive i thought strangely and wonderfully alive i stepped into a at the curb inspected the directory then inserted a coin and dialed the number of the building that housed the hall of symbols
i leaned back while the automatic drive of the directed the car through the speeding traffic its electric eye more efficient than my own
yes much more efficient than my own at the moment which were wandering over the figure of a female on the walk whose upper part was the perfect torso of a woman and whose lower part was a sinuously thirty feet of brilliantly mottled snake
you could never have escaped her embrace of your own will once she had wrapped those coils around you i thought upon it
the of these was certainly more vital possibly because the who lived here kept the people healthier
perhaps the were naturally more fecund of
it had indeed been a day of i mused when some old had realized that not only would a strong integrative field with a rich supply cause all matter to grow at an increased rate but would also cause even the most dissimilar to unite
it has been the realization that had resulted in various form life
most of the crosses by this method had resulted in an increased strength and fertility
they now were more numerous than men and often superior in mental ability
automatically my mind associated the embrace of the snake woman with the six arms of the giant of and i decided that i understood why had driven me here with his scorn
if i learn about life here i never would anywhere
that had been what he had reasoned
soon i was striding between the fangs of the great beasts mouth that was the door of the hall of symbols where the school ways converged
about was the bustle attendant to any way station rushing travelers gazing about lost in wonder at the vaulting glitter of sculptured pillars and painted walls done by men of a calibre whose work like myself can not grasp entirely
paintings and sculpture here hammered into the brain a message of the richness of life that immense mutual effort can give the lift unit the pro
this richness of life was pictured in a terrible clash with evil its opposite
the hot fecundity of life and health growth was a sensuous blow upon the eyes the soul leaped to take a hand and make life yet more worthwhile
i could not cease gazing at the leaping vault of pictured busy figures whose movements culminated in that offer to the spirit of man to join them in moulding life to a fit shape
my rapt study of the paintings was interrupted by the sound of a pair of hooves that clicked daintily to a stop beside me
i glanced at the newcomer who had stopped to stare up at the paintings also in that curious way that people have when they see another his my glance became a stare
what was the use of aspiring to be an artist my reason said if those great masters who had placed that mighty picture book on the vaulting walls above were so easily by the life force itself she was but a girl younger than myself but what a girl her body was encased in a transparent glitter her skin a rosy pale purple her legs mottled with white ended in a pair of hooves
and as my brain struggled to grasp her colorful young wagged her tail it was all too much
speculating about the force possible in the creatures was one thing but having it materialize beside you was another thing entirely
such a beautiful tail it was
of the softest most beautiful fur
what were you staring at she asked
the paintings i then answered
the paintings

i guess

yes the paintings
a

painter

was a painter

i gave up
i talk i had to look
they are marvelous they she declared enthusiastically
i always look at them when i come down to the school
i am studying medicine
now take that painting up there on her arm and breast i saw the medical school a mans figure struggling with a great snake disease
it took brains to study medicine
this exquisite young thing so full of force so powerfully attractive was smart too
and almost instantly she proved herself to be extremely friendly and companionable
she went on talking describing theorizing in a gush of amiable conversation that left me dizzy gasping and admiringly breathless
she told me everything about the paintings the statues
and before i realized it we were walking on together
she was full of all sorts of information and it seemed she had taken it upon herself to be my guide to teach me the meaning of everything we saw
her cheerful chatter soon told me all about herself her studies the schools the great doors that led to each one from the central gathering place of the school ways
the hall was justly famous for these doors
before us now was the door to the medical school formed of figures struggling with the coils of snakes
next to it was the marine school door formed of a whose huge claws met to form the arch
a a pendulum device to tell of the nearness of bodies in space formed the entrance to the school of space navigation
all the ages of science of immortal growth had combined here in the symbols that formed the many doors
from the moment that i pocketed a disc that bore the girls name and address i was no longer an aspiring artist i wanted to know what she knew wanted to learn what she was learning
was her name a short sweet name for a girl and hard to forget too
you cant forget a girl who her tail at you just like that
and so she took me into the medical school and directed me to her own teacher
i became a member of the class immediately and discovered that i had entered upon the opening discourse
the class was dominated by the immense presence of the teacher a son of the bearded and horned expounding in the exact of the training
as he spoke i became certain that this dynamo of human force should soon charge such a small battery as myself with everything in the way of knowledge i could assimilate
there was only one slight disturbing factor
just as i had sensed a strange deeply buried and secret fear in the i knew that in the mind of this great son of the there was a gnawing something that a part of his brain dwelt on continually
fear was a smell that was ever in the nose down here in city
the realization disturbed me so much that i failed to absorb a portion of the teachers discourse
my absorption must have caught his attention too for i saw him staring disapprovingly at me
with a start i my mind on what he was saying

 a great cold ball hung in space
once it had been a mighty living planet swinging around a dying sun that it had never seen being covered with clouds
then that sun had gone out and the deadly stiffened the surface life into glittering death
the planets forests which had lived in dense dripping fog had in their many ages of life deposited coal beds untold miles in down to the stony core of the planet
no fire had ever touched these forests because the dense fog had never allowed fire to burn
our nearest neighbor in space is such a planet now although much smaller
as it is on so it was on the unknown planet
hanging in space the dead immensity of this ball was largely potential heat for its tremendously thick shell was mostly pure carbon
such once was the sun your sun and mine the sun of which is a daughter
then a blazing meteor violently from some sun in space came flaming toward this cold ball
deep it plunged into the beds of carbon
the fire spread of not the of our sun was born into flame a carbon fire is a clean fire and contains no dense metals like titanium uranium emanations in in suns cause old age and death because minute particles given off accumulate and convey the into the body there to kill it in time
then sun heat was clean and life sprang furiously into being on its daughter surface
nor did this life came only by being eaten
then life suffered old age not at all for there was no cause
the voice of the teacher paused a moment and now indeed i knew that there was much for me to learn
here was something that struck deep into me with an instantly vital interest
most of all was his peculiar emphasis on the word then
i could not help the question that sprang to my lips
why do you say then life suffered old age not at all for there was no cause
is there cause now it was as though i had placed a torch beneath the hidden fear in the eyes for it flamed forth suddenly for all to see but it was as quickly
all in the class looked at me with that shocked expression which plainly said i had my bounds but in the eyes of i thought i saw the gleam of approval and i found a dam to hold back my ebbing courage
the teacher looked at me and i saw kindliness in his eyes
you are new here
therefore it is easy to understand that you have not heard of the projected migration of all to a new world under a beneficial sun

yes young there is cause
he was answering my question with determination now but he was not speaking to me alone he was making his answer a part of his discourse
i have spoken of the carbon fire as a clean fire
by this i mean that the atoms of carbon when send forth the beneficial energy ash called which can be assimilated by our bodies and used to promote
however the source of this ash is not carbon alone but all other elements excepting the heavy metals such as i mentioned before
it is when these heavy elements begin to disintegrate in the that we come to the cause of age
the particles of and other radioactive metals are the poison that causes the aging of tissue
these particles are thrown out by all old suns whose shell of carbon has been partly or altogether burned away permitting the disintegrating fire to reach and seize upon the heavy metals at the suns core
our sun has begun to throw out great masses of these poisonous particles
they fall upon in a continual flood entering into living tissue and it with the radioactive disease we call age
through the years the centuries these poisons accumulate in the soil of the planet and are continually being washed out of it by the rains with the result that all the water on is becoming increasingly contaminated
when these waters are drunk the poisons accumulate in the body finally becoming numerous enough to completely halt all growth and still worse to prevent any effectual use of which is the food of all integration
the of course have devised means to protect us from the accumulation of the age poisons but it has become evident that their efforts are not entirely foolproof
we have discovered that we are living on a world that circles a sun that is growing old and is therefore deadly
we are living in the shadow of death a shadow that will grow greater as the years pass until finally death with strike us all
we would if we remained not even begin to live out our lives
centuries and centuries would be lost to us and ultimately we might not even attain the initial growth of maturity i ventured another question
what methods have the devised they are simple ones
multiple distillation of the water in which we drink and bathe treatment of the water in a centrifuge to remove the very finely divided age poisons that can not be removed by distillation generators to create a magnetic field of energies air to remove poisons from the air
but i must impress upon you that it is impossible to shield us from all of the age poison from that small amount that actually falls upon our own bodies and accumulates there as it does in the water
eventually if we remain on we will grow old and finally die
i looked him squarely in the eyes respectful in a degree equal to the kindly interest that shone in his as he returned my look
it is not the age poisons you fear i accused
he looked at me silently and a flood of force seemed to flow through me encouraging me protecting me me
it was the same feeling i had gotten from the
come students he said gently
we will go now to the embryo laboratory
before we entered the laboratory we were given nutrient potions prescribed by the for his students to make them more receptive and hence his work easier
we were told that we would receive these potions regularly
even as i took the first draught my brain throbbed with a new growth of ideas and strange new images
i was exhilarated beyond all imagining and my enthusiasm knew no bounds
i took hand in mine as we into the laboratory
it was truly a wonderful place the most amazing i had ever seen
i felt like a admitted to the of a giant
here were things that were beyond my intelligence to create of my own mind power and yet i was being given free and welcome access to all of them to learn from them and to use the knowledge if i wished in my future life and work
many strange machines filled the laboratory all performing tasks that i could only guess at
but these machines were subordinate to the real science of this great room being designed only to chemically and electronically and develop the many human that moved and grew in duplicated in sealed bottles
the older ones kicked and tugged healthily at the tube which supplied the life paragraph continues the blood of the gods
and it was this blood that was the subject of the lecture the now gave us
he told us of the upkeep and preparation of this fluid both in the embryo and the adult the difficult and important part being he now stressed his words with greater emphasis with his attention bent especially toward me the process of detecting and removing the slightest trace of the radioactive poisons that cause age
i studied and i learned these were the processes which had given the planet its health and enabled us to live under more aging suns than other races
these were the life methods that had given us our fecundity which had populated space for thousands of centuries with the seed of
i wanted to know all there was to learn about them
the an old master at this most basic process of life had imbued me with an enthusiasm for the true creation of life in its infinite possibilities of as no mere painter ever had
the delicate handling of those products of from which primary are formed the mixing of these into the atoms of elements the chemistry of combining these atoms into the molecules of the substances used in the manufacture of the synthetic blood these steps were sheer artistry yet were made as simple as child thought by the genius of the
once more the commented on the proposed emigration from weaving it into his lecture
there seemed to me to be an undercurrent of double meaning in his motive for repeating it a double meaning that i strove to associate mentally with the that was something else and also something so secret it must not be mentioned
it was as though even the fact that there was fear of that something must be kept secret
our aging sun he said threw off increasingly large amounts of these suns seeds small but dense and active disintegrative particles and i learned that keeping peoples young was an increasingly difficult job for the
i learned that the and were preparing the plans and ships for our migration to a young newborn sun where the force setup of life conditions left a greater margin of for intake of power where went on at a faster pace and where the infection that caused the occasional trouble with detrimental energy robotism or detrimental err in the human did not occur
w hen the lecture in the embryo laboratory was finished we filed back to the classroom and there the flipped the switch that controlled the that supplied the home of many with the course
we had not been dismissed and i could see from the puzzled looks on the faces of the other students that this was not in accordance with the regular schedule
for a long moment the looked at us and especially at me
then he spoke today things have been said and seen and discussed in this class that had no direct bearing on the course you came here to take
you have been the most brash my face grew red and he hastened to add no i do not mean that you have been too forward i meant brash in the sense that you have exposed yourself to a greater danger than that of my wrath
his eyes at the word wrath and i knew that such would never be much of a danger i meant the menace that has caused the fear you have somehow seen in me
perhaps you have sensed this in other places in city among others of the so it must be for you to have been so certain of it as to challenge me
yes there was and is fear in me
and it is a fear that we all try to keep secret because those of us who show fear also show suspicion if not knowledge and either has been equivalent to the signing of a death warrant
there are spying rays on us

at the moment we are screened

that seek out our knowledge and destroy us before we can coordinate it into an effective to the thing that is going on to the thing we fear
what is that thing i breathed aloud so intense was my interest
the drew a deep breath
it has come to me that certain groups of are against the projected migration and the recent disappearance of several men important to our work lends color to the story
of course we all know that the only units able to do anything of the kind would be the key of sub and center
some of these may have accidentally suffered a severe flashback of detrimental ion flow so that their will has become one under detrimental hypnosis
what area has become so corrupt as to allow such a condition to go unchecked i can not understand but that we are all in danger until the thing is checked is most certainly true
therefore since you here have gained an inkling of something wrong it is only your right to be aware of it so that inadvertent words may not cause you great harm
also we must fight this thing and all of us must fight
so you may consider yourselves deputized by the ruling life of to seek out the information that will clear the way for the migration
until that is done we suffer fear not new to me but new to most of you
you may go
looking back at his gigantic form as i left the classroom i saw him musing deeply and the concern on his face told be that things must be even more fearful of consequence than he had made us believe
reason told me too that it must be great indeed must be the evil that can bring fear to the heart of a the super being of all and of the universe
that evening took me to a dance
never had i known that there could be such pleasure and as a part of it all i discovered that my education was to continue through every waking hour whether in scheduled class or not
there was so much to be learned from actual living and it seemed was determined that nothing should be lacking in my education
nor did i object for nothing suited me better than to have her beautiful tail and all showing her friendship and interest
the dance she told me on the way to the hall in a car was very scientifically handled by trained
the stimulation of human attraction between male and female she told me was due to the generation of many kinds of tiny and fecund spores which grow and are released upon stimulus by male and female
the male spores grow in the female and vice versa just as pollen between flowers
this cell pollen and the sensation of its growing presence is love
i could imagine the immense fecundity given this process by the strength of the race whose growth and youth never cease
we arrived at the place where the dance was to be held and i found a great room draped and decorated by paintings that depicted such scenes of love and joy and health as i have never before seen
just as the paintings at the hall of symbols held forth that invitation to join in the elevation of the race so did these paintings show the way to participation in love and joy
the dance had already begun and we joined the throng on the floor
almost instantly i was aware of the influence of stimulating frequencies
i felt the flow of of appropriate my nerve cells responded in a thrilling fashion
the stimulating rays strongly ionized the air of the hall making it extremely to the electric pressure of the body aura so that the dancers were intensely aware of each other
the consequently augmented vital aura of the cell pollen permeated the hall
it was absorbed by my body and by that of lovely snuggled in my arms and by all the young ecstatic bodies of those who danced about us
under the stimulus we wove intricate patterns on the gleaming floor and the odor music of the wove into the sound music many scent accompaniments
these are of the most and nutrient of all the food chemicals feeding the nerves as they are driven into the body by strong sound waves of a frequency
in the enhanced delight of the dance i was oblivious of all but the bundle of vitality to which my pulse and soul were synchronized and my arms held as a treasure beyond value
then as i lost myself in pleasure it happened
the madness of the fear that was upon city struck and for the first time in my life i knew the true meaning of terror screamed and pushing me from her pointed to the edge of the dance floor
there the great shoulders of a horned son of a hunched one big hand clutching in desperate agony at the folds of a the other pointing up and out to indicate the path of the ray that played upon him
even in the face of death his only thought was to tell what he knew of the fear and to point out its direction so that the might answer with a ray of their own
but nothing checked the ray and i realized that contrary to all the usual rules there was no guard ray on duty
no wonder there was fear in slowly the huge youths face turned black his legs buckled he fell and rolled over on his back tongue protruding and eyes staring
he was dead
his friends rushed to him but the deadly ray had not ceased
it played first on one figure and then on another each victim rolling in turn to the floor face black with death
by the elder gods i swore to myself at the realization that no guard ray was going to protect us
it is true our perfect government is not so perfect after all i stood as though oblivious to the fact that death might strike my way too
i could only look and rage within me at the death that played about the recently hall
within me the stimulating rays still caused an elation but it was submerged beneath the surge of wrath that made my blood hot
was tugging at my elbow the canny will to live of the female evident on her face in an expression of anxiety and calculation
together we left the hall taking a route along which her clicking hooves led me
we kept with a group of young who walked without panic or the impulse to run toward the parked
i knew why they feared to attract a to themselves
fingers pressed warningly on my arm and i heard her whisper her voice low casual
an excited tone might have attracted the curiosity of the mad mind behind the black deaths who must even now be surveying the scene of his mad acts of killing in grisly satisfaction
listen to that man just behind us i listened
his voice was also no excited note
in his voice was the cultured note that was evidence of one who has absorbed much of the vast education obtainable in cityalso heard that what lies behind the fear and death here is the mad wish of certain to appropriate the whole fleet of ships prepared for the migration and go to the new sun leaving nothing behind alive with brains enough to build and fly ships in pursuit
thus they would have the new suns clean light entirely for themselves and their future seed
a selfish thing indeed but more mad than selfish
such a view could only be the result of detrimental err
the speaker went on
we the know how fecund life can be but we also know the madness of refusing all of the normal units of fabric the right to existence and growth
no social fabric can be built of dull and lifeless robots which are so with detrimental energy that they refuse the least of the units of the fabric their right to growth and intelligence
therein lies the strength of the social units realization of its own self and its place in the whole
the whole basis of a fuller life is the acquisition by mutual effort the backing on which is woven the social pattern of the fabric itself
i heard another voice answering in agreement yet with a troubled note evident in its tones as if the speaker felt that agreement alone was not enough that simply denouncing a thing that was as evil as this would not be enough
yes this murderous effort is doomed to failure
the intelligent members of the guilty must realize that such murder of the normal life unit is the refusal of their own right to share in the fruits of the social project
they must realize that such men as the youth they killed have a potential value as great as their own
another voice in
then why is it refused recognition if they are intelligent then why do they act so it must occur to them soon or it will be too late
unless they are all mad said the first speaker
the sane unit of such a project will see that the basic unit right is inherent to their own success and realize that destroying those rights will wreck their own plans
the only thing it can he is the explanation a growth some have been charged by coil leaks

i could not help breaking into the conversation
that is right the thing has been explained to me that way as a detrimental hypnosis in which the self recognition of the mind centers confuses its impulses with the detrimental impulses to destroy
such a condition is called or detrimental energy robotism
the thing is simple enough but i can not understand how it could happen here in city where perfection in romantics is so old
such an occurrence is guarded against by many battle by great organic battery brains raised for just that purpose
how could it happen the two looked at me and shook their heads
they knew as little as i how it could be
well it but it did said with feminine logic and taking me by the arm led the way to a
in a moment we were speeding away from the dangerous area
beside me relaxed with a sigh and i felt her trembling with reaction
i put an arm around her
brave girl i whispered
we were soon nearing apartment and looking down at her fresh young face i felt a wave of worry pass through me
i wish we were under that new sun right now on those freshborn planets of life with clean new coordinating mechanisms under we ourselves selected and could therefore trust
i fear that the migration has been too long old suns pressure upon the unseen base of our life is now too great for anything else to happen than what happened tonight
can we help to strive against this immense err in the control minds about us as it must be or must we flee at once before they make impossible our flight thinking of it has a danger of tale bearing but lips were on mine as the slowed before her home an effective to my dangerous words and my mind no longer dwelt on the imagined the embrace of a giant female or the crushing coils of a snake woman about it was too busy recording the ecstatic sensations of the intense vital charge the girl threw into her embrace
my mind gave up its worry in soft contact
the next day i entered the classroom and found it empty
i went to the incubation laboratory and found several other early students standing there in silent consternation the fear welling up almost to in their eyes
the was not present nor were any of his attendants
some of the were dead others because no attendant had turned on the filtered enriched air tanks which kept their nutrient fluid supply aerated
i started toward them but a young son of a stopped me
i turned them on he said in low tones
where is the i asked
no one knows was the answer i got from all
other students came in now among them
she came to my side but remained silent troubled
we waited a short time
then a student called tutor center to inquire
he turned to us with a peculiar look in his eyes
they say he is ill ill the exclaimed question burst from all of us
in this was startling
illness is almost unheard of a rarity existent only on the space frontiers where new varieties of germs were sometimes troublesome
the news brought close to me her tail trembling as shook her slim body
i am afraid she whispered
her fear transmitted itself to me and the thought came into my mind that this room was not safe
the same thought obviously had come to the others because our movement toward the exit was as though by mutual accord
there was obviously some awful connection between the black deaths and the strange
yesterday the had said a guard ray was on while he spoke to us so gravely of the that guard ray been no guard at all had those evil penetrated the guard ray heard his words known the as a menace to their plan the class was time by fear and somehow i knew that the thought in my mind was in the mind of all
we had the same knowledge the had
we were in the same danger
we were marked for disappearance illness or the black death we must flee now or never proof of the thoughts of the others came almost instantly
as we in assumed down the tunnel toward the ways one of the accompanying youths proposed a picnic in the forest to celebrate the unexpected holiday
he said it loudly in a gay voice and the others chorused their delighted approval a delight that paragraph continues and i feigned too
all fell in with the project the unspoken desire to flee the city strong in our breasts our anticipation of being together among the trees which dwellers seldom see strong too
i raced ahead with shouting gaily let me lead you to the
there was meaning in my voice and intent in my mind
i was not forgetting my promise to my friend the
we reached the shaft that led to sub from which we would take another lift to surface
there as we shot upward i whispered the news to the
the terror is loose in city i concluded
escape as soon as you can
if at all possible beg off from another descent and be away
there is great danger for all whom they suspect are aware of them
he retained a straight face but i could see the concern in his eyes and the determination to make good his escape also
as we in apparent ease on the soft sod of the culture forest the traditional empty glass made its appearance in the circle
no one spoke of it but its significant reminder of deaths clutch was a constant thing in my mind
never had fear and death been a part of my thought before but that empty with its sweetly spiraling stem uppermost was no longer just tradition but now had a meaning almost immense
what to do to avoid that mechanical play of detrimental force from the mind of some unknown staring through the of his defective hypnotic mechanism seeking to destroy the best first if they thought we were escaping they would seek us out and snatch us back
i sat and mused
simple yet such mighty minds as the fall before it
we must be clever

i went on thinking of it but again recurred the regret of last night
if only the migration had taken place a few years ago but perhaps it had been so planned and delayed delayed by the black death which had thus far struck so secretly and silently
the plan of the must be near completion or their secrecy would have been maintained
and then as i sat there an idea presented itself
i knew a way to escape and i spoke quickly before my thoughts were clear enough for any unseen listener to read let us all charter a space ship and take a look at mother from above there is no greater thrill than that to cap the day as one we leaped to our feet
i knew then that our thoughts had been very similar i had only been the first to express the next step in spoken words
we will have to take a ship first said a young quickly
come i know the way
accustomed as i had become to life we presented a strange almost fearsome appearing company to my eyes as we made our way toward the ship station
there was young of blood and fingered his eyes huge and his mate a girl of except that some had given the line four arms probably under the stimulus of rays because the family pursuit of making instruments was one where twice the number of fingers could well be used a young fellow of mixed bloods older than the rest of us quiet but and listening fox his girl a thin gray maid of mars fragile and lovely her large eyes lighting devoted friendship wherever they rested two young sisters their horns just sprouting from under their curls their great bodies into womanhood their two escorts of the elders special creation youths of tremendous intelligence their hands their necks and shoulders by far stronger than normal to carry their great heads easily and finally a young male accompanied by his friend who was a distant cousin of my own and whose sprightly colorful femininity hinted that family must be especially noted for their beauty
together we made up a company of twelve of great diversity and yet all of us citizens of citizens apparently on an outing now bound for a gay adventure to end a holidays festivities in the supreme thrill a sightseeing trip into space
we dared not think of our true purpose and i knew that at least the two elder escorts were aware of what had brewed in my mind and would back me up when the time came
we thought only of our coming adventure and tried to feel the delight of it so that even our emotions would register true to any spying that sought us out to check on our motives
the ship we boarded was a small plane containing little but a cabin equipment and a small fuel compartment in the rear
this plane was not a space ship but only a sort of bullet to be shot from the surface of to the large station ship of great weight which circled in its own orbit just as the moon circles the earth forever
to get the ship on its way gravity was neutralized by an upward beam of force traveling at light speed which was turned on gradually until the car just floated in its cradle under the effect of the reverse friction to gravity of the force blast passing through the car
when the weight of the car was thus reduced to less than a pound i turned on the rocket blasts very gradually and traveled up the reverse gravity beam by instrument
in thirty minutes we were circling the huge station ship as though we were in our turn its satellite just as it was a satellite of earth
with vernier rocket blasts about the size of toy pistol the nearly plane approached a landing
above us spread the world we had just left making an imposing sight as we settled into a cradle atop the space station
when we stepped from the ship at the edge of the oval landing area we saw several bustling about their own type of plane a long splinter constructed of a very fragile and substance
although i feared to think upon it the moon was my next destination
one thing that all of us knew was that we never intended to return to earth
the blackened face of that son of the the noblest blood in city as he lay dying on the dance floor rose before me to tell me flight was not only best but the only course for us
in spite of myself my eyes roved over the black dome of space searching for the lights that might indicate a pursuing craft
it seemed almost impossible that we were fooling the mad and their spying rays
in spite of all mental guards my mind seemed intent on shrieking escape escape through every possible loophole in my concentration
i engaged the gnomelike in conversation in an attempt to still further blanket my turbulent mind
caught my eye and wagged her tail in cheerful encouragement seeming to divine what was on my mind
how expressive that beautiful tail of hers was how much it could say and with no dangerous thought waves to betray its meaning to those who must not receive on their sensitive instruments
with that tail no language no was needed but even if pursuit developed i had one trick up my sleeve
i dared not think of it or some watching might advise any pursuers of my plans and a way to them would be devised
it struck me that not all of the might know of recent conditions and developments in city
nothing had been announced on the news
thus while we were escaping others ought to know the truth and certainly not all the were
they would not report what they read in my mind and the who knew would not attach special significance to others who knew and the very fact that it was thought about in an way might cause them to dismiss us as of immediate danger and thus blanket our intent to escape
i thought of the dance of the sudden striking of the black death on the dance floor of my puzzlement as to what it might mean
i thought of the disappearance of our tutor wondered if he too were murdered
any getting a register of my thoughts would certainly ponder the meaning of the unbelievable existence in center of murder murder whose actuality he could not doubt because it would come to him as the and therefore true thought of a such as i was
in time still acting out our enthusiasm for an unexpected holiday we chartered a fast space ship for an hours time
an attendant led us to a cradle on the landing stage and we entered the ship gaily
the rose slowly up the beam under my control and when it was clear of the station ship i sent it hurtling outward
when we were well out of sight of the station ship and picking up speed toward the moon i gave up thinking of our trip as a sightseeing outing which was to proceed only a little way into space and then return but began to think of the moon as our destination meanwhile setting the destination needle on
then i pulled the throttle back to full on
if what we had heard of the black death were true it might well be that no space ships were allowed to leave the vicinity of at all
just the mere fact that we were hurtling straight away might have placed even more suspicion on our purpose if we maintained our original
with the moon now our revealed destination our true purpose was still veiled
i switched on the electrically magnifying scope screen to the rear to look for possible pursuit
the scope had a screen of microscopic which turned the tiniest light ray into an electrical impulse which was greatly augmented by vacuum tubes and the resulting impulse made a much larger cell on a glow strongly giving a vivid image in
far behind us a craft sped along
was it in pursuit i watched it for long minutes but there was no way of telling
it maintained its distance and its course
in a very short time their instruments could check our course and if they were pursuing us they would be unable to correlate it with my mental image of the moon as our destination and they would be after us instantly
if they were merely harmless travelers to there would be no questioning of our own course
i gave them time to check us with instruments then i set the course pointer on mercury a planet almost never visited and watched closely
the strange craft veered
they are on our trail i said
the words broke a silence that had become almost intense
cousin looked shocked
then we cant escape she said
they have a mechanical advantage over us
one of the was eyeing me shrewdly you have a plan he said
it was a plain statement of fact not a question
it was as though he did not ask what was my plan but expected me to put one into operation now that the crucial moment had come
yes i agreed
now is the time to play my one card
i hope that it will be an ace
we have not asked nor even wondered about your plan once we observed that you had one said the other
but now the time for secrecy is at an end
it is unnecessary
if we can not escape our intent to do so will be useless to hide if we can escape our intent will not need to be hidden
true enough
and i will be more than glad to relieve my mind of the strain of withholding what is in it i said
i am but a youth and the task has been hard
but one that you have done well observed the young gravely
i accepted the compliment with a thrill of pride
praise from a was something to which i was not old had many times given me exactly the opposite
it is a matter of mechanics i explained
and the one thing i will be forced to blank out of your mind as i do it
i warn you all not to think on the matter when you see it performed
as to my plan of have an even greater one
i will explain fully in a very short will go to one of the elder stations on a cold planet
the nearest of these is on the very rim of this solar system
a good choice approved the
but one that our curiosity in your mechanical trick to a high pitch
obviously you know that is seventeen and billion miles away
i could almost read their minds
yes
weeks away at the speed of this we have no food
even tail stopped wagging at only momentarily
in her eyes i read that confidence i knew she had in me a confidence that she herself felt was justified
your plan she reminded me
now we know you have a definite one for if you are aware of the fact that we have no food you must also be aware of a way to reach without it
such great faith must be well placed murmured one of the maids
i too can have no fear now that you have a plan
i proceeded now about the thing i had in mind taking care not to think of what i was doing but think rather of the appearance of my hands as they worked of the movements of my knuckles of the muscles that caused those movements of the nerves that carried the message to the muscles

 it was a good thing for me now that i had listened so to space pilots when i was younger some of their adventures were going to stand me in good use
mechanisms on these space ships were adjusted to a foolproof speed so that no citizen could wreck a of people
there was a stiff spring on the throttle just a little stronger than a mans arm which held the fuel flow to a safe maximum
i found the case of the auto pilot locked and the key was naturally not aboard the ship but kept by the attendant back at the satellite ship
but i found a way around that
i took the belts from several of my companions in spite of their puzzled faces and fastened them into one strong line
one end went around the throttle bar and with another i took a turn around a seat arm
a dozen strong arms pulled the belt line taut at my bidding and i took in all the slack at the seat arm
back came the throttle bar
the acceleration of the ship spilled them all in a heap at the rear but i held fast to the line and the bar stayed back
now our safety depended on whether the pursuing crew knew this simple many of the pleasure craft
which our pursuer plainly was were as well powered as the police craft although their restricted them to a much lower speed
if the pursuing crafts pilot did not think of adding other power to the strength of own hand on the throttle bar he would never overtake me
even police craft were set to less than maximum motive power as the tubes burned out too quickly at full blast
i watched the dark speck on the rear screen anxiously and slowly it grew smaller and smaller
when it had vanished the youthful pounded me on the back until my ears rang and my knees buckled
a sly fellow and your whole plan of escape is right
its high time we ran away from the black death
worried and waited for it to strike me long enough
the elder station on the cold planet are the best men you can find in space
been near a sun in centuries and know the meaning of the word evil he turned to the others and continued speaking eagerly
take us in give us entrance cards to any government in space personally i would choose some civilization that warms its cities with its own fires and shuns all suns entirely
had enough worry waiting for rulers to get wise to the danger and move
i want no more of these around me the gray maid spoke her sensitive green eyes shining with admiration her voice the slow singing speech of mars the best thing you did was not to tell us what you had in mind for someone would have read our minds as surely as loves us
we have lived in dread and indecision for many moons
the black death has struck day after day and no official word of it
no one can tell who is dead there is no way to tell if anything is being done about the danger or not for anyone who made the slightest effort to do so disappeared at once just as our loved teacher did
we all know that he was not ill and we also all know that the day he made that announcement to us he had signed his own death he had evidently decided he must as no one else seemed to move
it has been terrible and if you had planned this flight with us we would never have gotten away
we have been very lucky to get this far
now if you will take my advice you will go at once far beyond any influence from mother under another of planets and there we will learn how to live where such things as the black death do not exist
the smile she bestowed on me was magic
it must have been the look on my face that prevented any further remarks by my companions and caused them to look at me in new curiosity
if so my next words fanned the flame of that curiosity
i spoke of a greater plan a few moments ago i said
and i am afraid it does not call for such conclusions as you two have made
i am sorry but neither of you have given me any advice that i like as sound as it may seem
speak on prodded one of the his eyes alight with interest
i checked our course briefly to make sure we were headed for correctly before i answered him
then i made myself comfortable in a seat and faced them
what is it that we have been fleeing i asked
basically an aging sun said the young
the black death is merely a result of detrimental action on certain who have become and even ray
we have fled from them but the real cause of our flight is the sun
do we flee as our comrades i asked softly
or do we flee only that we may be able to make a new plan to take the place of the one that has been interrupted by the there was a wry smile on the face of the
the day has come he said when i have seen a put a to shame of course we do not flee for cowardice but to gain time and life to put up a fight
it is only that we have not thought it out as you have nor has inspiration as yet given us such a plan
then listen to mine i said just as it is with you my first thoughts at realization of the fear that lay in city were those of escape to a place where there was no fear
it is a natural reaction especially if that possibility suddenly presents itself
let us analyze the fear
first the top unit of the force behind the black death must be a man in a very strong position to stall off the whole migration as has obviously been done and to control things so that no news leaks out about the terror that is otherwise so plain for many to see
so high and powerful must this man be that to fight against him on itself must be to invite certain defeat
perhaps even if we were to muster all to the battle we could meet only the same frustration as the migration plan has is it not true that all who are aware of the danger of the suns evil have made utmost effort to bring about the migration true enough said a maid
no has been unaware of the danger and lately even such as you have been brought into the plan
perhaps it is fitting that the salvation of that plan come from the mind of a
then here is the only salvation i can see i said
we must go to the elders of
through them we must contact the mightiest of the and from them get advice and assistance
this thing may well become a space war before we are as i see it it must be so or all the of will be lost i looked at to see if she listened and she wagged her tail
not only was she listening she was thinking in tempo with me
at my glance her voice in doing things to my spine
yes and we ourselves must devote ourselves to the task and go to a place where the growth rate is unlimited by law so that we can become more equal to the job
it will take great power to displace the mad
on we must find some mighty and old and wise to go along and assure us of a hearing otherwise the power will not be given us
we need the very mightiest power the elders of space can give us to save the people of
if you but that tail of yours at them they will give it to us i laughed because i could see in all those around me the same conviction and devotion to my plan that was in her
the youthful company laughed too
of that there can be no doubt they agreed whereupon swished her tail before them and about on her clicking hooves
in that instant the fear was gone from our minds
instead we were filled with gaiety and hope and great determination to do all that lay in our power to end all fear
we circled mercury straightening out on a direct path for constantly accelerating until it was unnecessary to explain why lack of food did not worry me
the young remarked we will be at within hours
already our speed is approaching that of light
air locks
at last we were in the home of the kindly men from nor i leaned back with a sigh of thankfulness feeling that i had saved at least some of the good life seed of ancient from the madness that was all of its races under the aging sun
to save still more would be a effort but as arms drew about my shoulders i knew that such effort was worthwhile
the purpose of life was now
such beauty and tenderness did not live in words or in paintings
only in understanding and caring for the life seed the of future race growth could a man find the true meaning of life
and in the mighty job that lay ahead in aid for the saving of our people from the black death of the mad i knew i would become a man or die
we found the typical welcome that all the great ones accord to visitors
our party was courteously received by the attendants and we were directed to the administrative offices with swift efficiency
for me this first visit to a world people by other than or was one of the most interesting of my life but i did not find it half as exciting as my first glimpse of city had been
the men from nor were of an amazing for no light but of their own making had ever struck their skins
their size as did that of and varied with their age and with the age of the parent
thus a son of a man of a hundred years age would be three times the size of a son of a man of thirty
further the race from nor who are called are a straight race of men
there had been no of races of other forms not because it was forbidden but because their had not made the technique of breeding available to the public and without it all such intercourse is sterile
perhaps they are right although i see much beauty in in my own lovely and completely desirable with her beautiful expressive tail and her dainty clicking hooves certainly their race is beautiful and vital enough to please anyone
all about the city of the it was evidenced by many wholly unfamiliar devices that the science of nor had forged ahead of our own and as i looked about i knew why
here was none of the fear that had pervaded city nor was there any of the to be a detriment to constructive thinking in even the slight degree that evidently has long the of from full scientific advancement
the thought of the fear brought the need for haste once more home to me as we walked through the city toward the administrative buildings
it was better to continue our flight than to remain long even here i knew
so to improve time i kept running over in my mind the desperate plight of center the of the migration to a newborn sun the fear of pursuit that was still with us for i knew that in that administrative building toward which we were headed some watchful elder of nor was most certainly taking thought record of our minds to see if there were harm in us
so when we reached our destination it instantly became evident that we would have little explaining left to do
and at the same time another thing became evident to me that filled me with terror
fear again in the one place where i had thought i would not find it a young lady of the race glided toward me her hand in greeting her voice a soft bell of welcome for all of us
we have read your thoughts and understand what brings you here
follow me now to the princess chief elder for an oral check and forget your fear for soon you will be going to where fear is not
your message spells danger to us as well as to your poor helpless fellows in
it had been the words princess chief elder that had struck a new kind of fear into me
the chief elders had been described to me in city
they are the oldest of the race and are given official power according to the of their achievements to the race
they are of both sexes and have learned all there is to know of the secrets of growth how to manufacture their own essences nutrients and beneficial
and on their ability to improve upon the standard nutrients of the people often depends their success
thus when a simple like myself comes near one of these elders his will becomes their will automatically for it is overcome by the great force of the life within them
one hardly notices this when the elder is of the same sex but when that life force is of the opposite sex the attraction is so great as to be irresistible
so true is this that seldom is a of one sex allowed too near an elder of the opposite sex for never again would the poor free himself of love for the elder
my spirit trembled when i knew the elder to which we were being taken was a woman a woman who for unknown centuries had absorbed all the essences of substances
and too nor was a place where growth science must be far far ahead of our own sunbaked achievements
never would i be able to free myself of the spell that would cast upon me i looked desperately at sweet face
never again would i love her if this thing were true
in eyes i read the same fear and i know then that she surely loved me and i was torn by the approaching loss
however i dimly understood that it must be no man near an elder woman can deny her the truth of love for her
we left the building and presently were ascending a long transparent boarding tube into the side of a space liner that lay like a sleeping monster in the launching cradles
this was one ship that could land directly on a planet but then was small
we passed through a series of reached the inside of the ship
it was a long way into the center of the ship
as we progressed i noted that all the who passed were maidens beautiful white nor maidens with glittering hair that floated about their heads in a cloud so fine was it that it was airborne
soon i became aware of an aura of complementary forces that i knew came from the nor chief elder whom we were undoubtedly now nearing
her force scent grew stronger as we approached a mighty door set across a corridor
in glowing letters of hammered metal above this door was the legend elder princess of van of nor chief of nor on the great door i discovered was an airlock to hold in the ionized and air of the chamber
these chambers the elders seldom leave since all evil is restrained from entering
as we passed through the lock the terrific stimulation of this medium seized us in a mighty ecstasy
we were drawn as by a powerful magnet toward a huge figure which was an intense concentration of all the vitally stimulating qualities that make beauty the thing that it is
within me i could feel the compass of my being swinging toward its new center of attraction
i was no longer myself
i was a part of that mighty being before me
my thought was her thought i was her until she chose to release me
could she release me i could not even wish it nor ever would
within me i knew that and i felt no resentment no joy
all of eighty feet tall she must have been
she over our heads as she arose to greet us a vast cloud of the glittering hair of the nor women floating about her head the sex aura a visible flashing about her form
i yearned toward that vast beauty which was not hidden for in nor it is considered to conceal the body greatly being an offense against art and friendship to take beauty out of life
i was impelled madly toward her until i fell on my knees before her my hands to touch the gleaming flesh of her feet
beside me the other youths from center were in the same condition of ecstatic desire
as our hands touched her flesh a terrific charge of body electric flowed into us
we fell face downward in unbearable pleasure on the floor
she picked us up one by one and placed us on the desk before her
now were our burning eyes
she bent to meet our gaze and the mighty beauty of the eyes of the elder princess of nor flashed a question into our minds
as one man we chorused yes it is true evil has the upper hand in center in city itself it was then that i realized how far ahead of mother and were the and paragraph continues i supposed all other great ones of the dark worlds
for wasted no more time on us but bending toward the banks of instruments before her throne pulled a lever and through all the ship was heard the warning signal of departure
as if they were my own i knew her thoughts was to be evacuated
the were certainly not the our own race had proved to be
she understood the awful danger that could threaten a planets multitudes under the thumb of the madness
at her willed command we all ran to seats that circled the throne
they were mounted on acceleration
the grand hand pressed the bar that lifted the now ship up the force beam flowing out of the cavern
even through the thick walls of the ship we heard the huge scream shut behind us
then we were out in space headed toward nor the vast cold planet where this elder goddess daughter had been born centuries before
i realized that our precipitate departure was sure evidence that our news had meant much more than nothing to
she had enough elder god sense in her to know that flight was imperative
there were misgivings in my breast as i wondered if any elders or had knowledge of mighty presence in
it might make a great difference if they did as the acceleration lessened toward the midpoint of our takeoff freeing us from our seats the voice of the great swept us
you children will remain with me until your future is settled
i will thus be sure that you are fully rewarded for bringing us such vital information
the soft singing voice of the gray maid from mars questioned her and in its notes was gray also
will you

can you

then give us back the love of our dear ones which has cleaved to you there was a powerful pleading in her voice that penetrated even through the ecstasy that held me
infinite tenderness and compassion seemed to flow from the eyes of the great one
there is a way to do that the master voice answered and she bent swiftly toward the mars maid her great eyes flashing a strange thought i could not wholly read a tender into the eyes of the mars maid
that simple magic had made another friend this time a great one indeed
it was a strange passage
most of it seemed more a dream than reality
such things as the tremendous gait we built more than light the great distances we traveled were the realities but i barely noticed them
more real was the unreality of the thin lovely forms of the nor maids moving about their mighty princess the soft fires of their floating hair like flames from the vast fire of crowned by its floating cloud of yellow our own eyes burning like the spotted wings of moths against the screen of her will the sad faces of our own maids beside us gazing first at the fierce white flame of her body and then at our own selves the vaulting of the vast ship walls about us the unfamiliar instruments blinking and whirring
it was a very real dream to mea dream i knew i would never stop dreaming
strange passage

 ever the whisper of the feet of the nor maids on some swift errand the soft rumble of the voice of their living goddess and the answering bright song of her worshipping maidens
yes it was a strange passage and every mile of it brought home a fascinating realization
i had embarked on the most amazing voyage of my whole life
the very thought of what now certainly lay before me was enough to my mind into an apathy of thinking that was hard to overcome yet my mind was so full of excitement that it did strive to think to add to the realization of what the future would hold
a new life was p p at hand opening to wonders that staggered me to think of awed me into reverence
to live to become what this nor princess had become to have the love of people as she had the love of these nor is the real dream
i knew that i must gain the key to the door of a way of living that would lead to the full value of the life
so it was sitting in the of that beauty of we noted so little
how much time passed i will never know
it was as if all body functions ceased as though food and drink were not long as we were in the presence of of nor
but i did know that she was in continual communication with the planet nor over the space
face after face appeared before her murmured briefly and intensely and vanished only to be replaced by others
i knew vaguely that she was calling for a conference on the strength of our information and sensed also that we would attend that conference at her side
the thought on me slowly
here was an honor few ever attain in the first century of their growth
by old mother to see those elders of nor the whole lot of them male and female all at once

that would be more than one could well stand
an overpowering devastating ecstasy

 well it would be an interesting death
i never knew how much time the voyage consumed but it seemed very soon that the great vessel floated down the landing beam into the white and yawning face of a landing area on a station satellite of nor while i and the other youths dreamed on almost oblivious in the quarters of
still in that dazed dream of love we followed among her maidens into the tubes and aboard the special ship awaiting her and shot off to nor looming not far away
we did not pause on dark surface but descended into the depths of a great cave toward the council place somewhere in center nor
i had thought in the past that the were mighty of thought and what i saw now eclipsed anything i had ever heard of the glories of our own races
big and vital as was she was but a little child among the tremendous elders and gods
there are no words to describe what the development of unchecked growth in man brings forth
these ancient who had studied and purified all the of growth and combined them into an endless variety of nutrients which they introduced into their bodies by many in electric flows on sound waves by by direct been growing at a fierce rate for unknown centuries
their inner beings had evolved in various ways so that they were evidently of a more complex atomic and molecular construction than ordinary flesh
there is no way to describe the qualities of thought of inner strength of spirit seen on their faces and in the aura that is always about such beings
we after as she entered the vast reaches of the council cavern and took her throne by the side of her father a mighty bulk of but only a lesser in that gathering
before the council came to the business at hand we were treated to a brief prelude of a reward for the effort of coming to the council
it a prelude to music and dancing a review of the best talent of the planet calculated to bring the minds of the council into harmony on the subject of the welfare and glory of the race
entertainment yes but the amusements of elder gods are nothing to pass over
what it all meant was beyond me i was aware only of the awful beauty and tremendously fecund strength of the and fed by wizard of growth trained to express meaning and emotion of a kind too vast for to grasp
they danced in a vortex of rays which carried their thought and body essence augmented by apparatus to each
the climax was the appearance of the greatest beauty of the of the art of entertainment named wore on her head a device which caused a vast of the thought images of her mind to play about her body in a tremendous of the infinitely developed soul of woman
i had loved never before had i even vaguely what development did to the greatest value of life
the rewards this woman could give a man by the use of her mind alone coupled as it was to that mighty sinuous dancers body expressing all the things that draw men to women brought the of elders to their feet in an applause and a mighty vow to care for the race that produced her
this thought was also projected from the control rays which took root in every heart
it came to me too and i was a now no matter what i had been before then thought flashed out setting the thought cloud areas into with an alarm a command to attention
i was brought out of my to see my own thought record projected in the thought clouds
i saw once again as real as the first time i had seen it the fear on the faces of the of the screens the striking of the black death at the dance the hideous fear on the faces of the dancers sweet face contorted in a scream
a from the brain of each of our group from city followed
it was evidence enough thus gathered together that evil had the upper hand in
my own efforts to conceal my thought as i planned our escape and the trick of the belts on the throttle that had resulted in our success finished the record display
i was mightily surprised to hear applause and a great thunder of voices calling for of
they called for me the stupid artist those vast voices from hundreds of ancient beings some of them three hundred feet in height held me out in her two hands for all to see
and as i became the center of their attention my embarrassment exceeded any emotion of a similar nature i had ever had
if i had known that they would think of an escape from such a condition as so much of a feat it is probable i would never have tried it
i would have been hopeless of success the very inception of the foolhardy thought
i was put down again my face red my thoughts flustered my embarrassment a flood of discomfort in a discomfort that held within it a strange glow of humility that was at the same time a glow of pride
i was proud with a just pride and i felt somehow that it was not my own pride but the pride of whose utter slave i had become
elder of van of nor was proud of her the actual conference of the took place now in thought projections in the area
i saw that any thought no matter how abstract could be projected in these clouds by thought
they used an image language instead of words and their talk was to me but a whirlwind of changing forms faces geometrical figures maps of space and figures on orbits and many other things incomprehensible to me and probably to most of the present
the powerful minds of the functioned too rapidly for us to grasp any but the simplest meaning in the unfolding in the cloud before us
but i did gather that some action was to take place at once to save the and the of from the
now from the mists of the elder gods highest throne of all came a swift ray that lanced down and touched me delicately
an ecstasy of change came over me
what that ray did to me and told me in the next brief instant i can never say in any words
then a voice spoke out of we have seen the great compassion and love for your fellow man that lives in your breast
we admire such greatness in such a tiny and because of the love of man in you we have decided that it must not go without full satisfaction in deed
you came here to gather together an expedition and return to for the rescue of your comrades who are in deadly danger
never could you carry such a gigantic project as this would require to its successful yet you have done it for we of nor have made a solemn vow to rescue the men of on and to destroy the who threaten to spread their evil even into dark space
however because of your great desire we have planned a place for you in this great mission
you shall have your part in it and you shall have another duty which is worthy of your capacity for compassion
we the have seen in your mind a vision of the far a time on when men shall be slaves of the sun around which it circles of a time when they will be but mentally deficient savages living out a life span compressed to an irreducible minimum by
this may be a true vision in part or in we may not succeed entirely in our mission
we may even fail therefore we give to you the task of preparing a message in great duplication to these pitiful men of the that there may be some hope that those among them who have the mental power to fight against their cruel environment may make their lives in some measure complete
this message will be left on and in it in many places for future man to find
the voice ceased
the conference was over
as we passed from the misty of the council cavern turned to us of behind her and said in a serious voice
it is law among that no service to the race goes
now there are certain things i plan for you which i can not give you legally except you swear to serve me always as my loyal followers
is there anything to keep you from that her eyes searched us one by one
the mars maid answered her eyes shining there is only our oath to the state of and the present evil conditions render that oath void
went on i am only a young elder you might do better than to follow fortune in the future is not wholly assured
you might do better you have honored us said the mars maid
you have let us see your mind at work we know there is no evil in you
that your fortune should be our fortune is enough for me
you have said you will give the love of our men back to us and though i understand how you will or can i know you will
one by one we swore loyalty to before all other greater beings
then looked at her nor maids and said with a strange innuendo that made them laugh with delight and anticipation now we must send them to pairs the laughter of the lilies of nor rang merrily
what sort of a school was this i wondered to make them laugh so the tubes took train to the doors of her own cavern palace
huge air locks swung open to admit the whole procession into the under parts of the palace
when we stepped out into the special air of her home that tremendous acceleration of the life processes that i had noted in her chambers in the space liner again seized life became a thing to really fear to lose
but as yet i had no inkling of what lay before me in the mystery of the wisdom that had built that place to house their first borne elder princess daughter of the elder gods of nor
off her wraps which she had worn to the council chamber because of their significance said we will put the children in school and then to our own work
we have much to do to make ready and the time is short
school turned out to be a vast replica on a much scale of our own laboratory school where and i had learned to know each other and the possibilities of life
instead of the nutrient tanks contained six foot and even much larger men and women
taking and me in her hands she placed us in one of the big tanks
the liquids were warm and comforting and we splashed about while others of our group were also being placed in pairs in tanks like our own
then maids swarmed about us placing wires about our arms our wrists our hands and feet fastening breathing cups over our mouths thrusting needles into our veins and attaching them to the ends of thin tubes placing caps of metal with many wires connected to generators and other machines on our heads covering our eyes with strangely wired plates of crystal
i heard the tank cover sealed and more fluid gushed in until we were completely submerged
we floated in suspension within the tanks
then began a strange thing for our minds and mine were conscious of each other through the medium of the interrelated wiring and the plates over our awareness that must have been augmented a thousand times
her breath was my breath her thoughts took place in my head stronger than ever had and the of her was so augmented in my mind as to eclipse all other appeal that my memory had ever recorded
a strange little voice it must have been speaking over a instrument whispered beside me you will never escape now
you are her slave forever
and as i listened i knew that spoke the truth
face laughing before me in the eye plates became larger and larger entered my brain became the of my being
i heard thought a vast river of force flowing in my mind saying where i go there will you go also
the thing that is my desire is growing in you
my roots are your soul
you are my desire and the slave of my desire and i heard my own thought make answer in mind so it shall be always oh maiden of the clicking hooves and swift hands of the beautiful tail of the clean will and strong desire and i knew that what i said was true
the fluids and forces that were pulsing through us made these things grow within our beings so that centuries of loving contact were replaced by minutes of furious growth and we fell asleep strangely within each other our thoughts growing and becoming an part of our being
through every of my body i could feel fecund growth swelling and expanding patterned by thoughts which were mine and yet not mine
in my ears strange sounds beat mysterious meanings which were forces taking root within me
my memory was a vast garden of new thoughts growing as my mind grew and remembering all the principles that came over the wires from the elder gods own thought record
always overhead i could feel the nor maids watching my mind pictures and the growth memory so that everything took its rightful place
and within me i could hear sleeping and growing too and she was very dear
the thing that was me slept as a sleeps in the womb and the seeds of the gods thoughts took root in and me and grew
we were at once children asleep in the womb of the god mother and man and wife wrapped in each others arms
time flowed by like water and we slept but were more awake and alive than ever before and felt the pleasure of each the others body and soul appeal the very inner essence of and to man
life pulsed from each of us into the other constantly
we had more pleasure of each other in the growth school tank than ever i have known of in any pleasure
among the things that became a part of my knowledge was the promise of the future in such tanks as this sometime and i were to build such a tank and and take a long sleep in it and awake as gods full of the strength and the beauty and the pleasure of life and
so it was that and i were married by an actual mingling of the seeds of our being and not by any foolish ceremony blessed by the actual love of now our lady and not by any meaningless words
though we were in the growth tank less than a week we came out inches bigger in every way but the real growth that had taken place was an inner i was vastly heavier and my strength was aware of new limits
mentally too i was vastly more able for when i looked about at the apparatus i knew the inner construction and use of every bit of it and i knew that from then on few things would me other than the work of the very oldest gods
i found that i had not lost my love for but that i loved her now as one loves and is grateful to a leader
my love for was the strongest thing in me
all of us found out now that was not the most foolish of the elders of nor despite her comparative youth but was looked up to everywhere as one whose star was in the
her followers were more numerous than many much more prominent elders
and i spent several days together in our love and in seeing the wonders of civilization
here was a vast series of underground cities all heated and bathed in beneficial energies created
no need for a suns light to live
no danger of from a dangerous sun poisoning the soil and water of the planet to cause slow death by age
then one day called me to her
i speak now of the mission the elders of the council granted to you in the conference chamber
as you remember your part in the coming task is twofold
in one phase of this you will accompany us to act with us in the great war that must be fought
we have developed a plan in which your help as an advance and secret agent is necessary
you will be told more about that later when we have embarked
now however your other mission begins here on nor
it is the mission of love for your fellow men
no matter how successful we are in rescuing the men of it can not be that we will rescue all of them
many must not be rescued there is nothing we could do for them poisoned as they are to the point of death
nor must we allow any of this poison to escape to the dark worlds where it can infect others
too the influence is dangerous and madness must not spread over the universe
thus it has been given to you to on imperishable plates of our eternal metal a message to future man which will be placed on and in so that those who have the intelligence to find and read it may benefit by the truths of growth and defense against a death by age
after the passing of science from men will begin to die at the same age and their sons will all be the same size at the same age
this will be caused by of in the water of which will stop all growth in mankind at almost the very beginning of their development
they will scarcely get beyond childhood before they will begin to die
these plates you will will contain a message that is a key and a path to the door that will open life value to these future men whose fate we know and pity but can not prevent
we can only teach them what we know that will enable them to get the most out of their life on
the will not be able to read and thus will die as they should
those whose minds are powerful enough to escape complete will read and profit
you can tell them how to attain this life growth by freeing their food and water intake of all the poisons that will be found in it in the natural state
the age poisons can be removed by centrifuge and by still their air can be made a nutrient by proper treatment and freed of all its detrimental ions by field of electric
the on which the basic integration of life feeds can be concentrated just as it was in your body in the growth school tank in energy flows which greatly increase the rate of growth and the solidity and weight of the flesh
tell future man to do these things and their reward will be great
you have seen what the reward of such effort can bein thousands of years of on a planet under a detrimental sun
we can not save those men yet unborn
we can only leave for them the heritage that is rightfully theirs the heritage of our knowledge
and you in your infinite love and pity for your fellow men shall perform this task with all the energy that your love makes possible i left the presence of mighty at the understanding of the elders and gods of nor
no wonder that their race is so great
to me the humble artist of sub had been given a great mission one that thrilled me to my depths
i hurried to to tell her all about it
the wonder of it i exclaimed having repeated what had told me in my unskilled artists hands of culture man of been placed the hope of future man to me is given the honor to preserve for men yet unborn the knowledge of their heritage of life held me to her and her eyes were shining
yes i understand she said
there is more i went on
the set out soon to rescue many thousands of and and their offspring from the threat of death by a dying suns and from the black death of the but i am to be the of untold numbers of future men down through the history of until the very planet is dead think of it

kissed me tenderly
go and busy yourself with the beginning of the message
you have but little time and i think you should begin by putting down the story of thus give body to the message to future man
perhaps he will not even remember nor city nor all the other vast cities of center
perhaps he will not even remember that there ever was such a being as an or a or a
it will be your duty to tell him that too my loved one
for how can he believe and hope if he has no knowledge of the truth of life most certainly must i tell them of you i exclaimed
never in all time was there such a woman and kissing her again i hurried off to the laboratories to gather the materials necessary to begin scribing my imperishable plates of with the message of hope to unborn
for many days i worked putting down the truths and the knowledge to overcome the poison of age to the fullest possible extent as it is now done in city and all and the means to full life growth
i told the story of our flight from and much of the history of
i told of the and the who live throughout all dark space who are ever for new suns
i told of the who do not believe in living near any sun old or new
i brought my message up to barely in time
for when i had finished came to me
ship leaves for in a few hours she said
you must be ready
at that moment it hit were my last hours with my loved until i returned from the war in if ever i returned
now for the first time since reaching nor i knew sorrow
but saw what was in my mind and her words brought joy back to me
i am to go along as operator of one of the on our own ship she announced happily
i should have known that my loyal would never consent to remaining behind while i went into danger your life is my life she was whispering as she snuggled in my arms
where you go there also will i go
your souls nearness is my desire
it had been but a short month since our arrival on nor
many had been the preparations most of them unknown to me
only now as i went to the launching cradles did i see the full extent of those preparations
i found a fleet of mighty space vessels lifting from the frozen face of nor leaving to gather at a rendezvous in space
own vast vessel was not the least among the fleet nor i and the last aboard
on her we watched countless other ships lifting on reverse gravity beams with what seemed to be almost utter until they reached a point in space where they could take up normal flight
ships these were wonderful in their engineering and armament
we watched also many mostly nor and nor embark on our own ship
herself was already aboard together with several other elders of minor stature
they brought with them vast quantities of material of use
observing it i understood that their purpose was not wholly to save the people of my race from their sad plight but to nip in the bud the growing power of evil forces so near their own stead in space
that they were wholly confident of their ability to do this i knew but i knew also of the mighty armaments and endless of the armies
i had seen their tremendous vessels maneuvering around on the and the news
i hoped the were not overconfident
but as we proceeded into space toward at greater speed
i found that i did not really know the
i had underestimated them
they understood concept and i came to realize that concept had become a frozen thing on by comparison
the used the truth for it was the right conceptual attack
evil has no concept it is a mad robot to detrimental force
when evil has power and men must obey or die then only is it to be feared
but sometimes men fight for evil unknowingly
as we passed an space station a ship would land and presently take off again followed by all the ships of the station
they had just told them the truth
the had an ancient reputation that forbade any doubt of their words
it was as simple and as powerful as that
this went on so often that as we neared the fleet with us was nearly as large as our own
the truth can be a mighty friend and these space warriors knew the and trusted them
so impressed was i by the ships of this vast battle fleet that i was tempted to go to my quarters and describe them as part of my message to future man but i abandoned the idea
i reasoned that if my message were a one when it was found its would have little use for or need of such technical information as the construction of space weapons
perhaps when they learned again to fight the aging power of the sun and the evil her force can bring to life they could again learn such other things as they would need by searching space for friendly peoples
there was an would put down the information necessary to direct such a search
it would be a simple the great ones would never be found near or under the rays of a sun as old as this one will be by then
aging suns would always be a space horror to be shunned by all men
only the action of the on paragraph continues had kept our own so long under its rays
only on or near dark worlds and new suns would the great ones be found
it was while i stood at side watching still more ships join us that a thought came to me
how can the so quickly trust the ships of the as to allow a number of them near their own fleet silly chided her tail at my question they trust them
it is not a question of trust
they just place a very large female elder aboard each ship as it joins our fleet and there is no further question of trust or obedience
supposedly she goes aboard to advise the commander as to our plans and to interpret our ways to him but you know the real reason of course i interrupted her with a grin
i should certainly understand from my own recent experience with warriors are all male
those commanders and their men would be unable to do anything else but obey with complete loyalty
they could not do otherwise for they could not find the will or wish to do it
not even the commanders of space ships are elders by any means
under the spell of that vast they would be helpless to her will in their ecstatic love for her
there were maneuvers as we neared but i saw little of them
most of the time i was busy with my plates further knowledge or them so that they might be deposited in in many places
another job i had which took up much of my attention was the task of making from the heads of men in vessels nearby in an attempt to learn what had happened in since our flight
they knew little for the had evidently been as uncommunicative of true troubles as before
some whispers they had picked up but nothing of great value
i kept on but it was of little use
they knew just enough to make them ready to join us but no more
there was nothing that would help us in the coming battle
all we knew was that we were to war upon an enemy who was undeniably powerful but whose identity we would have no way of he struck first and that first blow might be a terrible one

noting some agitation in the ship i was watching i focused on the commanders quarters just in time to hear the last of a general message from surface and since we hold the population under our war rays and since the safety of that very population we know to be your objective let me warn you that the very first sign of an attack on your part will be the signal for a general slaughter of the people on our part
they are only in our way anyway
you may kill us in time but you will never attain your objective the horrible import of the message stung me into inactivity for a moment then i recovered and with haste swung my ray to hear reaction to this message
what would she reply or had she a reply to this development death for the very people we had come to save rested in her hands

then came voice and it held a world of in it a note of defeat that opened my eyes wide in disbelief
return to nor was what she said return to nor abandon our mission no it could not be
there must be a ruse in mind
was not the kind to give up even though the odds seemed great
then what voice in my mind said a single word come
i switched off my thought recorder ray and bounded down the corridor toward the great doors of hammered metal a wild joy in my heart that at last she had need of me and that certainly this was a ruse
even before i reached the great doors i knew one thing ship was not retreating toward nor as the others seemed to be
under cover of the swarm of retreating ships our own vessel had slipped into the moons shadow as we passed her and had come to a halt hanging there invisibly in the moons earth
once i arrived before that vast flame of beauty i sank to my knees but she reached out a great hand and raised me to my feet
from her desk she took a tiny box and showed me its one tiny stud a switch
take this and put it in your clothes
it looks like a pocket reading machine and it will not be noticed with suspicion
in the locks an ship and pilot is waiting for you
he has been directed to take you to surface
once there you will mask your thoughts in any way you please for i know your ability in that respect
then go to your old home in sub
there turn on your and wait beside it until you hear three clicks from it repeated at uneven intervals
then take out this box and press the metal stud full in
it will tell you what to do next
that is all
i bowed low kissed her radiant flesh and ran from her quarters
the ship was waiting for me the pilot ready and silent
he pointed out my old students outfit which was already aboard and indicated that i was to wear it
i my uniform and in a moment was once more student of center
when i had completed my transformation i found that the ship was already down the regular passenger lane from moon to
the pilot an spoke a few words of explanation and lapsed into silence
i am a taxi driver and a passenger
mind luck it was all so simple
i could hardly believe it would work
but it did
the ship settled on the public field
i my way into the tubes and soon was roaring along toward my student returning from an outing
i switched on the seat but apparently nothing was happening
it recited the most inane a taxi motor failure had plunged two fares and the driver into the sea and they had escaped with a ducking a had caught his tail in a subway door but would live our adored chief elder was having a birthday may he have many more

i switched the off
anything could to nothing out of the way would even be whispered
of the vast nor fleet that had been so lately above not the slightest hint
great was the control of the in not easy would be the task of the invaders reaching sub i made my way to my own home threw my hat at the old place on the hat rack embraced my mother and kissed the tears from her dear face slapped foster dad on the back and answered his grunted where in the whirling world of have you been wandering with just sewing a wild
ill tell you about it at dinner and bounded up the stairs to my old room where i switched on the and lay upon my bed carefully masking my thoughts by thinking what tale i would make up to explain my outing to dad
three sharp clicks from the startled me
i had not expected the signal so soon
must have been watching
i leaped erect drew the box from my pocket and pressed the switch
a voice came from the box
put this box on your head and put your hat on tightly to keep the box in place
do not take your hat off for any reason from then on
go outside and walk around the block
soon you will notice a strange thing after which you will get more directions
i did as directed promising to return soon when i dashed past my astonished mother and father
i stopped only long enough to retrieve my hat
outside a strange came over me
it was hard to move
the lights of sub flooded the ways but i ignored them and walked slowly around the block
i noticed the girl at the food tablet stand lolling fast asleep over her open cash drawer
how very careless of her to sleep so
but then i found the service at the stand also deep in slumber and several of his customers sprawled in slumber on the seats with the doors open the hood up
the voice in my hat explained the mystery
by now everyone in sub but yourself and certain others is asleep
so will you be if you remove your hat and the box which gives off stimulating
go at once to the administration center and switch off the auto watch and general attack alarms
bind the chief elder and anyone else who seems able to frustrate a landing
then seems safe put a communication beam on our position and guide us in the administration building in sub is a great tower which reaches not only to the roof of the cavern that houses sub but through that roof and on up to surface where it looms as the building on the surface also
great ways connected the surface building with the sub building
i activated a at the curb stand dialed the administration centers number and drove the by hand directly into the great hall and up to the doors of the council chamber
as i arrived i was surprised to see four of my comrades from ship racing into the hall behind me from at the curb
i nudged the great doors with the bumper
they held
turning the thing i drove across the hall and came back at full speed crashing into the great valves and at last they gave
i plunged into the hall brakes squealing
it all began when my sister and i were in a downtown st coffee shop
we had been shopping and had stopped off to get a coke and refresh ourselves
while in the coffee shop we were approached in a very way by two gentlemen dressed in grey suits who managed to interrupt into our private conversation
as they spoke to us we found that they were from a huge orbiting the planet earth and that their names were and
they told us that we had been very closely watched by the space people for the last eight years and that our progress had been noted off and on from the time of our birth
and i were both inclined to think that someone was playing a silly joke on us and we laughed when they told us this but they were not laughing and were serious and stern
we were strangely shocked however when they told us of a few incidents in our childhood that no one could have possibly known except the family
they told us that we had been selected as contacts by the people of space to serve as channels through which they could give certain information to earth and that we had been carefully watched as i stated before
they told us of the reasons why the space people were coming to earth and that they were here to guide earth along the lines of brotherhood and science
we were very much amazed at their words and we noted particularly the kindness and warmth that shone in their eyes
with a single glance from them we seemed to sense the vast wisdom and brotherhood which they must have lived among
after talking with us for a little over two hours they left and told us they would contact us again but it was not until a week later that we were impelled to again return to the same coffee shop
when we entered the door we again saw one of the space brothers and he gave us instructions at that time for building a device whereby we could contact the space people
his instructions were explicit and precise for he warned us that unless we placed every piece of the device in the proper place we would not be able to contact them with it
we were not allowed to take the drawn diagram of the device with us but we had to remember it as it was explained to us
when we obtained the proper pieces for the device we constructed it when we returned home and were happy to find the results were satisfactory
we were amazed when we tuned in on the mother craft and spoke with the same person we had earlier seen
we were also allowed to speak with the commander of the craft who at that time was known as
in the following six months we spoke many times with the space people through the device and received much information about their homes sciences and craft
in of i was alone in downtown st on business when i was again contacted by the space people and at their request went with them by automobile into where we drove to a heavily wooded area
there i was told was where they landed when they had business or contacts to make in st
settled back behind an old barn was a circular craft that i judged to be approximately nine feet in height and about feet in diameter
it had a domed top but no
the sliding door was open and there was a uniformed operator sitting at the controls
i was nervous although i knew no harm would come for me and i was visibly shaking but only smiled as though to reassure me
the flight to the mother craft took approximately minutes and i was told the magnetism of the small craft would not affect my watch since it would be balanced by the magnetism of my own body
however while in the mother craft the magnetism of it caused my watch for stop and it was in a small machine before i left
inside the mother craft we entered the huge receiving room for the smaller craft
there were many huge machines in this room and there were also many other uniformed men standing around obviously working upon the machines or moving them about
they glanced at us when we entered but then returned to their work as before
the hall that we entered was softly lit and was curved both at the ceiling and
we entered the first room to the right which appeared to be a room for relaxing
there were divans and chairs with white that had a thread or design of a golden hue woven in it
the room was meticulous and vast and as i stood observing the beauty of it three uniformed men approached us
their uniforms were of a color with a slight metallic look and i learned the type boots they wore were actually attached to the uniforms and were not a separate piece of apparel
the uniforms were soft to the touch and the texture of velvet
i was then introduced to three men and learned that one was the commander of all craft operation upon earth
spoke with a very heavy accent and was much darker than any of the others
his skin had a high bronze tint to it as compared with the lighter of the others
from this room i was shown the control section where i was told our calls were received when we operated our device
here they placed a call through to our telephone in st by adjusting a series of dials and i was allowed to speak with and tell her that i was with the brothers
i was also shown a scope similar to a television screen the only difference being this was at a slight elevation on the control counter instead of standing up at eye level or in a box type cabinet which our television sets consist of
this scope could obviously reflect any particular building or house that the space people desired to observe and when i looked at the scope when requested me to do so i could see the inside areas of my home and could see my sister mother and the children moving about
it was as though the entire roof had been removed and only the walls remained of the house
when i asked them how this was done they explained that the first set of that left the roof were erased and the of the furniture and people inside were received on the scope and therefore it appeared as though the instruments in the control section were actually looking through the building
from this section we entered another much larger control section and i watched other uniformed men going about their work with much deftness and swiftness
i was told then that we were going to dine and when we entered the dining area it appeared as a vast empty room
however tables and chairs rose from the floor section and i dined with them after humbly and respectfully listening to a prayer said in the universal tongue
the food consisted of three different types and a drink similar to apricot nectar was enjoyed
there was little conversation during the meal and when all had almost finished told me i could witness a dance performed by two of the space brothers
this dance was most unusual and fast during which the two men passed a small object from one to the other sometimes throwing it in the air and catching if before it fell upon the floor
i expressed my thanks to for allowing me to see this and when we left the dining area we moved down the hall to what obviously was an entertainment room where the brothers spent many relaxing hours
many men were in the room some sitting at tables and others playing a game similar to our
i was asked if i would like to try the game and after watching i understood simply how it was done
a round colored disc about four inches in diameter was placed on the floor in a particular square and by mind power alone the disc was to move across the floor to another particular square
this section of the floor was electrically charged and receptive to the thought waves leaving a persons mind
took a blue disc that was handed to him and placed it on the floor causing it to move a considerable distance
then i was handed a red disc and asked to try
i was doubtful if it would work for me and the only thing i could think of was to silently command the disc to go
i was amazed when the disc moved slowly up the floor but quite some distance from that of
when i glanced at my watch and noticed it had stopped it brought attention and he said for this time he felt i should not be held up longer from my other activities and that a second trip would be longer
it was then that he took my watch and placed it in a small machine in the first control section and then set it for me obtaining the proper time from a scope that contained many symbols and crossed lines on it
then with and i returned to the craft receiving room and entered again a smaller craft with them
i do not know exactly what series of air locks the craft enter and leave the mother craft but there was a large dark section upon the floor in the receiving room and as we entered the smaller craft to leave pointed it out and told me that was area where the craft left
the trip back was quick and short and as we drove back to st i recounted in my mind all the things i had seen
being alone i wanted to be able to tell anyone else as much as i could however we decided that we would not then tell everyone else of our experiences until we had enough information to relay to the public
last year at bucks convention we were called upon to speak but we were neither prepared nor expecting that we would be called upon for a speech
i did however say a few words and since that time we have delivered several lectures to various groups
a few weeks later we were contacted by the brothers and were told that the council had requested us to speak of the powerful effects of the a and h bombs and also the future of those responsible for their evil
when we were told these requests we asked for information to give people and the following is what they gave us
it was prepared by one of the brothers known as
i will go directly into his message and then would like to take up a subject that many people have questioned us about such subjects as evil flying saucers and evil space people also strange phenomena that seem to defy natural law will be spoken of
now i would like to give you message scientists are creating around planet earth the most deadly condition to material man than ever
the of the a and h bombs are placing the residue particles of radioactivity into all the materials of earth
each human being upon earth now carries a certain degree of radioactivity in their bones and systems
why should it be significant to hear of this when you can not see the radioactivity nor hear it as it does much destructive work in the advanced laboratories of mars we have proved the of such uncontrolled energy
radioactivity drops upon the grass buildings and people after being carried by the air currents around an explosion
this energy is in minute particles that have the effect of deterioration to the molecules of all material things
this radioactivity settles around an object or body and the outer area of the surface or skin
what does radioactivity look like you may wonder
as an explanation many of you have seen small dust along the streets or in a dusty area that swirl around and around in circles that then seem to disappear
radioactivity has the same effect and looks very similar as it settles around a body
the small particles are caught up in a swirling motion that causes them to be driven down into the surface of the body cells
this energy once inside the body the balance of the normal cell and causes it to become either agitated into more activity as it tries to cast back out of the system or else the radioactivity attacks cells that are already weakened by illness and immediately sets up a destruction of them
when this new activity occurs in a normal cell a powerful microscope would reveal the structure of the cell is creating a counter offensive action that is clockwise as compared to the motion of the radioactivity
when this occurs there is eventually a breaking down of the cells motion for as the of the a and h bombs continue the action of the radioactivity is strengthened by this and overpowers the clockwise motion of the body cells that are attempting to throw off the radioactivity
thus the body cells are forced to become activated in the same manner
this creates a drawing together or construction of the cells and creates abnormal conditions and illnesses
as the radioactivity increases the rate of motion increases around each body living on earth
this changes the cell formation and in the next generation this inherent condition is accentuated by the accumulated mass of more radioactivity
in the second and third generations these changes are visible as definite of the body and this in turn if not controlled will lead to a generation of
what does radioactivity sound like i will try to explain
many people are receptive to certain high sounds that are derived from the atomic and are the elemental changes in the atmospheres of earth
these high pitched sounds are very serious for they can almost the very soul consciousness and cause changes there
the consciousness of man is being affected every day by these that these have created and unless these are altered or until the of this nature are stopped the mind of man will be changed in drastic measures
some of these notes can cause a perfectly healthy person to develop a fatal illness some can affect the mental processes terribly other of these if not altered within the consciousness of the individual can cause one to commit acts that otherwise would not be done
but most serious indeed are the changes in the structures of the atmospheres of earth
here the greatest battle of all is arising
the earth wants to separate with this activity but the of the higher evolved here upon earth and in space are preventing this until earth can adjust
how can you stop this from happening the answer is simply stop the unnecessary tests of these bombs
for those who maintain it is necessary to show the military strength we can only say what strength is there to be shown that the people vegetation and animals of a perfectly beautiful and future otherwise
is it truly possible that the of such destructive weapons can replace sane sound actions of better living it is necessary now for the space people living upon earth to take protective measures or otherwise suffer the same effects from radio activity as the citizens
it is not possible for us to give people enough of the without the cooperation of the governments and such cooperation is at present unattainable
the continuance of these tests are affecting all responsible for them and if one accepts as an answer it would be definitely seen why no one here or responsible for these tests would want to relive again in bodies of the future generations
if be unacceptable to the average person then the knowledge that these tests are their children and their children should be sufficient reason for stopping them
our warning to earth is cease your tests and save your future
what the space people are trying to make clear in this message and many others similar to this is that earth is now in a most perilous situation and faces of humanity
in the two years we have contacted the brothers they have been concerned and talked most frequently about the of the a and h bomb
speaking of this destruction the questions i mentioned earlier come to my mind and that is concerning the evil flying saucers and evil space people
first we must consider the evidence presented
there have been saucers that were reported as having a negative effect upon people by burning them or causing nausea
and in some instances there have been cases reported where people have been assaulted by beings that have emerged from some saucers and actually attacked them
the descriptions of these beings have been generally of a small type of people who were unusually crafty or mischievous and who actually grasp people and attempted to drag them into their craft
where do these beings come from and why are they entering this system no doubt most of you will agree there is a tremendous battle going on between the good and the bad which concerns all thoughts actions and influences
from thousands of years ago to the present age this battle between right and wrong has been waged against civilization and has balanced first in favor of the good and righteous and then turning and swaying in favor of the wicked or evil
this strange course of events has been necessary for certain conditions to prevail upon earth so that beneficial results would come about
the devastating plague that swept in the dark ages was indeed a terrible thing and was judged to be just that by the people but this negative condition actually paved the way for more sanitary conditions
all evil will give way to the good and all wrong has a right
the space people that have negative qualities about them are coming from farther space systems although i do not wish to imply that all space craft from farther systems is evil
many of the craft from farther systems are very good and are also trying to help earth however it is only those certain evil systems that we should consider when i say those from a farther system than our own
it is these negative beings who are here for the purpose of actually taking people from earth to them with their ideas so they in turn will cause confusion and disturbances upon the planet
the true purpose behind this is to prevent harmony and peace for they are in alliance with those beings living in earth who themselves will be forced to leave earth when peace and brotherhood is completed
the gains that these negative people obtain from their alliance with those other in earth is not known by us but it must be quite profitable for them to engage so actively against the space brothers who are trying to help earth
the space brothers who are trying to help earth have to contend with these craft and beings from other less desirable systems and also have to contend with the disbelieving masses of people who either do not know of the need for harmony and peace or those who do not want to listen to their urgent requests
the job of the space brothers is not easy for it is necessary to prepare the people of earth to accept their existence and also to guide them in proper understanding so that peace and coexistence will be possible
many people seem to feel that the negative beings are only from planet earth and consists only of those fallen angels who were cast out of heaven by a supreme command from the most high
many can quote the proper passages of the and prove that there are fallen angels living here on earth who cause the necessary confusion and evil which we here must live among
there are those of superior powers whom we would call fallen angels living in earth but it is not wholly from them that the evil or bad flying saucers come
as you look up into the sky at night you see multitudes of stars planets and suns moving on in beautiful orbits
however if you could move out through space and watch the barbarous conditions that exist upon some of these stars you would be shocked
there are some systems advanced in scientific accomplishments to the degree of mastery over space but those systems have advanced in science alone and have little spiritual advancement
they come here to earth and to other planets in farther systems to form alliance with those who will provide them the necessary fulfillment of their evil desires and wishes
planet earth is now visited by such craft whose occupants live and profit from the unrest and disharmony present
who can truly say what percent of our actions are these beings with necessary materials and profit
what these profits are can not be said by us for only each one of us in our own understanding can know in truth what their actions consist of that could be used as a fuel by the negative ones
these can present very good arguments and can deceive the in many ways
their goal is to conquer and own without any concern how they do it
they may use one form of attraction one time and another the next
now how you probably think do we know about this
i can only say that many times more than we have recorded or remembered we have been interrupted in our attempts to contact the brothers by means of our device and then encounter the transmission of a negative craft
in many instances these beings have mocked our efforts and have the brothers and us
other times they have lied and said they were the section of mars and they had a message for us from the council and that we were to say or else we were to stop speaking altogether
patience is a good way to win with their persistence for they can not persist too long without getting angry and revealing themselves
once we were interrupted by them and told flatly who they were and what they wanted us to do
they asked us to prepare a book for them and expose the whole untruth connected with the story of the fallen angels
this book was to be delivered by one of their very advanced minds and to be created in manuscript form by us and offered for publication
please notice that i said this book was to be done in this manner at their request
we refused to do as asked by them and burned the first few sections of their story when it was delivered to us
from that time up to the present we have been interrupted only occasionally and then their attitudes have not been quite as demanding
we refuse to have anything to do with this type of beings and wish to serve only those of goodness and light
the subject of negative beings can be connected directly with much unusual phenomena that seems to be completely contrary to natural law
however nothing can defy the absolute laws that god created but many of these laws are simply not known nor understood by millions of people
the percentages of people who can manipulate these laws is very few
as said before many beings of a negative nature do live in earth and there are some of these who have the power to do unusual things
many times strange phenomena have been noted to take place such as objects moving freely in the air articles appearing and disappearing solid objects passing through walls door
the number of unusual happenings are
many of these happenings are due to the mischievous minds of negative beings who merely change the molecular polarity of the structure of an object and cause it to pass through the air as though defying gravity
truly such an object is moving freely through space but only due to the natural law of gravity
if an object such as a glass contains the positive polarity of mass then the earth below it is of a negative polarity
merely by changing the positive polarity of the glass to a negative polarity it will cause the glass to push away from the earth which is also of a negative polarity
the law of a magnet can be applied to this simple demonstration for like polarities repel and unlike polarities attract
two negative polarities will push away from each other whereas two polarities of different natures will cling to each other
thus gravity or more simply said polarity controls such unusual demonstrations
it does however take a very great will power to command such objects to move
nothing can be done outside of natural law
power and nonsense must still obey the laws of god for nothing can be outside of his laws
an important thing however is that not all unusual happenings are the result of negative beings but much of it is unknowingly set into motion by the minds of earth people who happen to set into motion the law of polarity and gravity
i would like at this time to dispense with the subject of negative things and like to direct your thoughts to something of a more affirmative nature
i would like to give you a little of the prophecy for earth that the brothers gave us
however at no time do the space people or and i want you to think that these prophecies are definitely what will happen to earth
the brothers told us that these things would happen only if earth follows the path of advancement that she had been doing before the of so many bombs
these could alter these conditions very much for as the brothers said these are altering the atmospheres and materials for earth
it is from mans past actions and advancement that these prophecies are derived and it is from this that the future is formed
thus prophecy can change and years from now these same prophecies could be wrong but only if people continue with the a and h bomb and if a series of serious battles and conflicts result upon earth
as for the prophecies themselves the space people tell us that earth will have an axis change and that this will cause to become warmer and certain parts of to become colder
this axis change should come about slowly and be a gradual thing and will be if nature is left alone however there are certain people who wish to bring about this change too quickly
as for the manner of clothes people will be wearing upon earth in the future we will see that the men will wear clothes that have a tighter fit whereas the women will wear and longer dresses
the homes will change with the circular home being preferred
there will be a screened dome top to the homes which will open to let in the air
lighting will be from the walls and a circular rim around the ceiling
this lighting will be automatic and adjust itself to the proper brightness
all power for the kitchen laundry heating and lighting will be provided by small individual units in each home that is inexpensive to operate
the countryside will be beautiful for all wires telephone poles and power stations will disappear along with the billboards and other unsightly scenes
the entire mind of man will enlarge in spiritual growth for books shows and entertainments will be revised to teach truth
television will be the greatest channel for truth to reach the minds of the people
as the mind of man changes to higher thoughts so too will much of the material requirements change
and it will come to pass when the dietary habits of man will also change
no longer will slaughter houses be seen for the eating of meat will diminish
it will not entirely disappear but the vast slaughter of animals will cease
earth will cease to have epidemics of disease and therefore newer systems of laboratories will appear
illness itself will be an individual thing and will be corrected quickly and safely in the laboratories
what more can we ask for for this sound like earth could be a beautiful place there is time does not permit me to enlarge on all the prophecies for earth
among the many things to happen earth will also have space flight and will enjoy the companionship of the space people
when earth has risen to this height of advancement space flight will become a common thing and people will then perhaps go out and serve other less fortunate planets just as the space people are serving earth now
there are only a few more things i would like to mention and they are concerning a question which has been asked of us
a few months ago and i announced that we were publicly withdrawing from actively speaking
but since that time an erroneous idea has sprung up that perhaps we had been by the three men in black
we would like to clarify this for we have not been visited by anyone who threatened us and we were temporarily withdrawing from the field for personal reasons
these reasons were due to certain changes we were going to make and one was due to the fact that i was going to leave for
however different plans have been formed and i am not going to leave for therefore we will be available at times for lectures and speeches
when and i made our preparations to go to a convention we felt it would be interesting to get as much direct information as we could from the space brothers so when we contacted them we asked if there were any definite statements they had to give us
we received a lot of information from the section on mars and presented it in her earlier comments above but we also contacted the planet and received much interesting information from a called
i would like to read his message for you which we received just a few days before we came down here so without any further comment at this time i will quote the message from of often the revised facts of history come to our attention for the credibility of the human mind is filled with much misrepresentations
as our sciences developed on we were able to devise machines capable of picking up the past actions of history and by a series of transformers create the scenes and sounds of history
many scenes that have been completed on planet earth have been viewed and it is with understanding that we realize the means of recording for were inadequate
barriers of language and habits prevent the from knowing what ancient man meant by his words and phrases which he left as a record of his deeds and actions
languages that have long since ceased being spoken or learned create much of the present mans difficulty in comprehending what his ancestors meant by certain symbols and figures
the present stage of man can not possibly know what was in the thoughts of the ancient man who left as a record chipped symbols and signs upon rock and marble
the dead languages of the past create the insurmountable barrier for it was thus the purpose and plan of the creator to prevent the understanding of certain tribes
when the decree was given to have the tribes split and the languages differ upon earth it was for the purpose of veiling the darkness from the untrained mind of the evolving souls living on earth
thus the sealing up of ignorance and the fallen angels began
as history proceeded the decrees of those possessing the wisdom of darkness grew until they recorded much false history that glorified their deeds
the sons and daughters of man had learned the wisdom of entering heaven but used the illumination they gained and instead of living according to the proper laws they built and obtained material creations to satisfy their bodies
thus the spiritual advancement of man was prevented from properly developing and the decree of and chaotic thought filled the earth
much time passed before this was completed for it was from that the messengers came to start these changes
changes came and flooded the earth and the separation of people began
through these many years the civilization came arid passed leaving its imprint with the only means of communication known then but those of different language found they could not comprehend what the ultimate motive for certain symbols was and as the vast civilization of the fell into obscurity so too did the true meaning of their records
history came also and then left along with the rulers and people but none of this history is known today in its true sense
the language barriers are definite and profoundly confusing to the minds of man who tries to surmount them
earth man was thus protected from himself by this of language for the wisdom of some historical periods and people would have been destructive
those people who came to earth being sent by the creator in his wisdom served to prolong the advancement of man and his material creations for it was known that earth man could create anything then that his imagination would reveal
earth man had reached an evolutionary cycle where he responded to the intellectual flash of creation that was born from his mind
he could see mental images of vast material creations inspired by the elevation of his thoughts and in disobedience to his spiritual growth he sought to satisfy this and create similar effects
knowing the effect this would have upon the development of his mind the messengers of came to prevent the of man
the true creator was no longer exemplified in mans mind for it became filled with the material wonders devised in his imagination
the centuries of advancement that had before earth knew the trend of mans feet placed her people in a position to see the evil that earth was committing
those wicked people who during the rise of own civilizations had been cast down to earth were creating of slavery of
this time in history was during the period and the separation of minds was decreed to take place
those from came and gave warning to the faithful of earth who unlike the other followed the laws of the most high
the story of a man called in your holy book was one of the faithful who survived this cleansing of earth
those unfaithful of earth who followed the fallen angels were deprived of their powers to control by the division of the universal tongue
no longer could one language be understood by another for the different ones of faith who were saved created various dialects and interpretations at the guidance of the messengers
as a means of preserving their might and power the wrote upon stone tablets and inlaid their writings in marble thinking men in the future would look upon his recordings and wonder at their power
now their magnificent temples and homes lay beneath the ocean in obscurity lost forever to the minds of man
the tongues of the earth are many and varied for not even two people of the same tongue use exactly the same phrases
it is possible for those of the same tongue to understand each others ideas and words but when one interprets the language of another into their language some of the true meaning is lost
this is the diversion of the tribes of man as decreed by the creator
in the age of the the evils of earth were by the evil ones who fled from the exploded planet called and who created the same evil on earth as they had created on their planet
false grew and multiplied on earth at their direction and the fallen angels of lead astray many of inhabitants
seeing this the wise ones of came to earth in their craft
called these craft and a wheel inside a wheel another name given to the craft of by has been a cloud
the years of saw a growth of intelligent comprehension in man and it was through this growth that mans eyes became open to the evils around him
he no longer lived in a world of innocence and obedience but the people began to follow the evil influences that the fallen ones of heaven had brought with them
earth was then polluted and as a new cycle of change in the heavens began the wise ones of came to earth to warn all to repent but many did not follow their guidance
being wholly instructed by the most high council the who came to earth told the faithful to leave for certain areas and thus the tells of only the one story of a man called who with his family built a means of sustaining the change which was to come to earth
the wicked and evil ones died in the axis change and that occurred while the faithful were saved by proper warning according to the order of the most high
again now we watch earth follow the path of
terrible releasing of energy in bombs is making your earth a place of
plants and animals are being by it and soon even the water will become undrinkable due to the radioactivity of these bomb releases
our help can only come after a certain length of time has elapsed from the one to the next
we can offer our warnings and guide those who are faithful to certain areas but we can not ourselves move to stop the tests of the bombs
brings upon himself unnecessary tribulation
the question of another major war is asked many times by earth people and we say that there must not be another war
the truth in your holy book will come to pass for we see again the evil works earth does and the most high council can rule at any time upon the necessary actions
we repeat we can not intervene in your bomb tests for the will of must be fulfilled so too must the law and if such evil actions of man do not change we will lift the chosen people to watch from afar the rest of
let those who have ears to hear let them hear
signed of
i have a few comments to make concerning this message from of for i was very much interested in knowing of the rise of earlier civilizations particularly the
many people have asked us of this phase in history and so it was natural that we would prefer to obtain the space brothers opinion
so many really important facts are contained in words that i would like to draw your attention to a few in particular
at the first of his message he said

the human mind is filled with much misrepresentation
then he went on to say how false history is accredited to this misrepresentation and he explained why this came about
we all know that many of the facts in our history books are based only on a few records and that these could have been hurriedly and written or transcribed
the plain truth that any of the ancient languages can not be completely understood today is due to the fact that the human mind is divided in its wisdom and that certain knowledge then does not prevail today
therefore the present mind can not possibly understand all the phrases and written symbols that the ancients tried to reveal in their records
our explorers and archaeologists are now finding and strange records and symbols that they can not
a language of symbols was the only way to record the universal tongue
the people of ancient spoke the universal tongue and as we recall in the message of he said that due to evil acts the people and tribes of were split and i quote his words
 it was thus the purpose and plan of the creator to prevent the understanding of certain tribes
we learned that the fallen angels were the beings who lived on the planet that once was in an orbit between mars and and that these evil beings fell to earth after refusing to accept the word of the most high council
we can understand why these beings were considered as angels and why they are considered as falling from heaven to earth
at the time of the beings upon the planet were extremely advanced and possessed space flight and wisdom that earth man does not yet even know
they were thus advanced far beyond the modern men of earth and were indeed of rare wisdom
their fall occurred when they disobeyed the most high and continued with devastating experiments that caused their planet to be exploded
thus cast out by the most high and the other angels they descended to earth where they were forced to rebuild and start a new
they had lost a vast and beauteous planet and thus fell to the early civilizations that earth possessed at that time
they continued their evil on and when the angels in heaven saw this they were commanded by the most high to cause this to cease by scattering the people and dividing the language so the evil ideas of the fallen ones would not be understood
when the messengers from arrived to start the work of the most high tells us that

the sealing up of ignorance and fallen angels began
since the space people of did instruct and guide the faithful people of earth to sacred places where they would be safe when certain changes took place we know that they will again do this at the proper time
our scientists know that there are cycles of activity that earth passes through and also said in his message that
 as a new cycle of change in the heavens began the wise ones of came to earth to warn all to repent
the people of knew of the inevitable axis change that was to bring a flood and to earth
the faithful were warned and only those who were full of obedience to the most high received the warnings and instructions
thus earth was cleansed and the evil ones with their records and language sank with and other continents while the faithful were saved
we find the space people are now prepared to again warn those who are faithful and to show them sacred ground to go to also to lift them from the face of earth itself and protect them from the radioactivity and evil of those who do not follow the laws of the most high
our space brother has said

let those who have ears to hear let them hear
has told us that the evil of earth will continue until the planets and oceans are radioactive unless puts a stop to this evil
the space people can not intervene nor cause all the a and h bombs to become inactive for they too are held in a certain status until the time comes when the most high issues a decree of action for earth
no doubt they have the wisdom and means of making all the storage of bombs inactive but they will not or can not interfere unless the order is given by the most high
the brothers have told us before that the evil ones of were experimenting with energy releases that our scientists are playing with today in the a and h bomb experiments and that due to this they brought about the axis change more quickly than the natural change would have been
he has told us the of earth could be brought about too quickly for an axis change is coming and if left it will be natural and slow but if the explosion of bombs continues it could bring about this axis change too quickly and cause
many times the enthusiast asks us why the space people just come down and take over earth would be better off
but has answered that question and until earth is again ready for the natural axis change they will only issue warnings and perhaps take the faithful up to the far heavens where they will wait the final cleansing of surface
the problem of flying saucers has become very deeply interwoven with the fate of earth and none who investigates the phenomena can come out of it without sensing the complexity of the solution
no one can give a definite account of all the space peoples purposes but we can share the information we do get and piece together the intricate puzzle of what they are why they come to earth and how earth is being benefited by them
to the faithful who keep the laws of the most high we can only phrase the words that so often come to our minds
 rejoice and be exceedingly glad for great is your reward in heaven

 beginning a series of revelations concerning what is going forward in the activities of those not at this time encased in mortal flesh and those who are or will be their associates on the
thy friends in the unseen be possessed of bodies more amenable to transposition from one phase of manifestation to another as water may manifest as steam as snow as ice and so on depending on atmospheric conditions natural or artificial
this greatly enhance their ability to aid mortals at this time
pardon the diversion be ye interested in concrete facts deduced from acute sensitivity to present conditions and their inevitable consequences
as hath been said the precise moment of divine intervention depend absolutely upon mans reaction to tests imposed not by thy heavenly father or his obedient emissaries but by the of the enemy
as ye do at times forget the warfare rage upon the astral planes simultaneously with its progress on the
the mere fact that so many thousands have been killed not conclude the matter in any wise
they still live thus our problem is to segregate them not as to earthly categories but in accord with our innate purposes and desires
naturally this greatly complicate the task of those whose responsibility it be to resolve the whole matter into its basic constituents
with regard to thine own country which be destined to act as a springboard from which to extend real aid to other lands the present distressing exhibition of preposterous antagonism to inherently just and legally sanctioned procedures to rid the administrative branches of the government of utterly subversive and traitorous incumbents can not be tolerated
as plots of the enemy are exposed to view it be for the people to choose whether to cast their lot with the forces or the
there be no middle ground

to remain neutral be the most crime of all
ye do deplore the lapse of time yet of what consequence be the amount of time consumed compared with the of criminals posing as of the human race presently many millions of souls will be following a of ever progressive evolution or doomed to tread the downward path of misery and degradation
is it not worth the price of a few months of desperate conflict darkness and light vicious hatred and superhuman courage to make certain every mortal now living is in his or her rightful place not in accord with some arbitrary law or human decision but according to the unerring knowledge and wisdom of him who see and judge the secrets and hidden motives of mans hearts i say it will be settled not by any natural advantage of superior numbers or the use of weapons devised by scientists who have or think they have contacted and harnessed the secret powers of universal energy
i say not so it will be brought to an abrupt and incontrovertible conclusion by an act of god comparable to none heretofore known to mortals
this planet be not caught in a net of inextricable difficulties but be emerging from its superimposed domination by leading to its destruction
it be placing its trust in the only power able to deliver it from its impending fate
i say to thee in all sacred solemnity of pronouncement this thy country shall be saved as by a miracle i say not it will be a peaceful deliverance but through the loyalty of millions who place their faith in thy master the of god this land will be cleansed from the now it
it shall be the center from which shall issue those injunctions and powerful energies which shall lead the world into an intense burning desire to know and to do the will of the lord god of all creation as revealed by their coming king who shall reign over this world without from those who now harass and seek to destroy his faithful servants
before any appreciable gain can be made by earthly representatives of thy masters coming kingdom there must come the downfall of vast numbers of bombastic of their own inflated belief in their own importance and influence over the people
assent gained through fear or force to nothingness when assailed by cold logic or intense loyalty to higher concepts a long and arduous warfare hath been waged against the powers of darkness impinging upon all inhabitants from invisible where long reigned supreme over his invisible to mortals assigning them to tasks of fiendish ingenuity to and human beings into abject slavery to his demands
by reason of the unremitting diligence of those to whom was relegated the apprehension and elimination of countless millions of and controlled entities sworn to obey the of their say as a result of this uninterrupted campaign on the astral planes it now be possible to transfer this battle to the physical plane and repeat the process where mortals may more effectively join in the conflict and observe greater tangible results
as it rage on the physical plane there be three types of weapons to be employed
first the actual material armaments necessary for defense purposes
second the mental agility to recognize and combat propaganda
third the spiritual awareness and moral stamina to move steadily forward in defiance of all enemy resistance to establish and maintain a rigorous regime of honest government in every phase of human affairs
ye may say the present deplorable condition of earthly affairs hath always existed and always will
i say nay through mans willful disobedience it hath reached a point where his own most determined efforts to remove the accumulated incubus of overwhelming pressure from subversive forces be futile
divine intervention operating through chosen emissaries endowed with power and authority to abolish the system in force when and his held sway hath prevailed upon invisible planes adjoining the earth and the roving hordes of diabolical of mortals be either removed or under control
now cometh the final stage in this stupendous project
not without physical discomfort and suffering may the victory be won
mortals must prove their mettle
ye may look upon this time of tribulation as a bitter and unwarranted on thy right to lead a life of honor and dignity
even so yet it afford thee a glorious opportunity to show worthy to participate in the responsibilities as well as the privileges of the golden age
privileges forever denied those now responsible for retarding its inauguration
no matter how previous be the suffering of many mortals in this final phase in the transformation of thy world all who will stand firm in their defense of the right on whatever battlefield they fight will soon realize that they have rendered a priceless service to their master and his conquering legions from outer space now able to traverse the hitherto impenetrable density of envelope and bring succor and strength to the forces in mortal flesh
a change cometh swiftly over the face of the earth and the peoples residing thereon
hour by hour the forces of evil themselves disclose their dire purposes
close upon the heels of these disclosures come the rapidly maturing decisions of the enlightened ones now dwelling in bodies to reverse the of false leaders and substitute their own true concepts of constructive action to insure the survival of desperately followers of one sent to teach men the way of life i salute you from a few further words of explanation regarding our presence and purpose
at the request of your heavenly father we come to assist your unseen guardians who are greatly perturbed over the state of your planet
we come ten million strong with a full complement of appliances and all necessary forces of an nature to use in any manner deemed expedient to block the designs of destructive forces or render their weapons
we realize certain portions of earthly terrain are marked for destruction
in of this program we withhold interference when so instructed by the hierarchy in uninterrupted touch with the father of us all
when certain prearranged signals are received we send thousands of to places where dangerous conditions exist
perhaps you will more readily comprehend our mission of merciful protection when i tell you countless instances of planned sabotage have gone awry owing to the vigilance and prompt action of our men
destruction for sake is not our practice
a condition may be most distressing and call forth our earnest desire to render assistance yet we are bound by the most sacred of vows to intervene only at the times and places indicated by our master or his accredited lieutenants
once given implicit instructions regarding a particular situation we are then free to work out the minutiae of operations according to our best wisdom and skill
but there is never a moment when we may not confer with our should we feel any doubt over some proposed step to be taken
our means of thought communication and visual observation of any person or place on the entire globe is beyond your present comprehension
it makes possible the fulfilling of a promise many times repeated that all who put their trust in god will be divinely protected under all circumstances
your heavenly father uses his dedicated servants to carry out his will choosing the ones best fitted to act in the various roles demanded in any crisis
our appearance in physical form or the of the ships we use occur only on instructions from our headquarters far above your bases in your stratosphere
they follow a predetermined schedule not as your clocks and calendars but in conformity with carefully computed sequences of events depending largely on mortal reactions to each step in the program
many factors enter into the decisions made such as planetary influences of a magnetic type astral conditions the activity of forces concealed within the earth body constantly changing rates in different sections of the globe owing to the peoples awakening to their perils and desperate attempts to extricate themselves
this latter consideration is perhaps the most potent point in releasing our forces in their behalf
they must themselves instigate the attempt to gain their freedom before we can go to their rescue
of course we fully sympathize with your interest in the mechanical construction and motive power used to achieve the feats of apparent which mark our arrival in your material world
even though we may for some specific purpose invite you for a ride it will be impossible for you to ferret out our secret of propulsion since you have rejected opportunities afforded you to become acquainted with laws governing these higher forms of energy
such knowledge has been for illicit purposes of destruction in the past
not until your world has dispensed with all need for destructive weapons and all desire to misuse the finer forces of this universe will you be permitted to experiment with energies holding magic possibilities for those qualified to employ them as intended by the creator to whom they owe their existence
we come now as but look forward to a more joyous mission when we will mingle freely with you and gladly initiate you into many delights and privileges we possess
may we count on your cooperation in bringing that happy time very near we hope so my love and my blessings i am my message concerns a number of erroneous claims being made by those who crave personal publicity
any one who may attempt to invest us with powers of divination and announce themselves the recipients of information pertaining to the private affairs of individuals unless they apply specifically to serious national or international matters are guilty of
only insofar as they affect our plans which must of necessity depend to a considerable extent on the understanding and cooperation of dwellers on your planet will we pay any attention to your own purely personal problems by prying into the future for answers to your queries
our interest lies in two directions providing the facilities unknown to your inhabitants to prevent a wanton waste of life through the reckless employment of powerful forces for destructive purposes

forces intended for constructive and creative purposes only and with our better comprehension of the principles involved both in producing and directing such intensive energies to transmit at the appointed time to those proven trustworthy the knowledge of a practical nature which we possess in regard to these forces
at present anything we might add to the sum total of earthly achievement along scientific lines would naturally be directed to warlike operations
we must first assist in the abolition of existing agencies bent on world domination by force a planet populated by slaves in the power of a mere handful of tyrannical may i inquire what is the polite synonym for bullies rulers would not even interest us having held numerous consultations with the honorable gentlemen responsible for the founding of this country our indignation has been aroused by the manner in which their noble visions of freedom industry and progress have lost the luster of their original inspiration and deteriorated into a dingy counterfeit of the original heroic model held before the eyes of the people
at that time much assistance of an amazing type was given at crucial moments
inspiration and the courage and determination to follow these magnificent ideals called forth overwhelming response from watchers in unseen realms
had they not been carrying forward gods plan depending on his guidance and his help no such country as would now exist i confine my remarks to this land for the obvious reason that it is here that a stand must be taken to rescue this precious and priceless ideal from extinction should this country succumb to the pressures now being brought to bear to it in a worldwide flood of where might freedom find a lodging place the combined forces of space men assigned to canvass the entire global situation and submit a workable plan for the rescue of those being rapidly drawn into a tightening net of infamy are united in what we believe to be the only means of handling this grave problem
naturally we do not propose to confine our efforts to this country by any means
there are others in far greater need of immediate aid being in many places suffering hideous injustice and cruelty
before going further i wish to make it crystal clear that we work at all times under the direct supervision of your future ruler the
we ask you to do is to lend to our reality and our entirely impersonal desire to be of service the sooner these two facts are accepted by people generally the more quickly and easily shall we be able to achieve our goal and the fewer lives will be lost in the process
we are admonished to save every soul who will gladly adapt to the glorious transformation scheduled for the new age some may be removed from your planet to help for a time from planes invisible as many thousands are now doing
i am referring to great many arrivals on the astral planes and a great many others dating back to your beloved the immortal and other men of their caliber
we are submitting our plans to the highest court of heaven for approval and we look forward with confidence to your cooperation all honor to all those who through divinely inspired intuition have grasped the true meaning of our mission

who have not attributed our various manifestations to any base or selfish motives on our part
any attempt to acquire anything we find of value on the planet would be but the act of robbery and utterly inexcusable since your inhabitants as a whole possess at this time a supply pitifully inadequate to provide your population with the barest necessities for physical existence
we plan to add to your resources

not subtract it is not my purpose to call your attention to the causes for this ghastly reversal of all universal creative laws designed to prevent any such dilemma
what very few of even your most advanced thinkers and philosophers appear to fully realize is the fact that innumerable purely material blessings naturally follow in the wake of a strict observance of these universal laws
even your own beloved master the did not formulate these laws during his earthly tenure in a physical body
they had existed from the beginning of creation
they were a part of the creative process they still are of the very essence of all creative process refuse to follow them and you invite destruction as is in all we see of misery want and degradation on your planet today
the contrast between conditions prevailing on our own planets and the chaotic disorder everywhere apparent as we observe life as now lived on the planet is painful in the extreme to contemplate
on this account we do the more earnestly commend the heroic attempts by many enlightened mortals to the blunders as well as the purposely subversive activities of vast multitudes operating in direct opposition to the most obvious dictates of their own good judgment did they but apply their mental machinery however rusty it has become to the discovery of the basic causes of your present difficulties
your planet was given a rare opportunity to learn the true and dependable laws leading to progress along all lines of achievement

physical mental and spiritual

when the one known to you as was sent in human embodiment not only to teach but to demonstrate in full sight of earth dwellers the beauty the efficacy and the supreme paragraph continues wisdom of compliance with those powerful creative laws enunciated by the creator of all things this advent of the occurred at what seems to us a very short time ago and many of us watched with fascinated eyes and the most intense desire and hope to see this saviour of mankind accepted and acclaimed ruler of the planet by unanimous consent alas the failure of all but a mere handful of people to catch even a fleeting glimpse of the sublime spiritual message he brought which would have freed them from all bondage to material things

their complete blindness

filled our hearts with despair of any possible chance for to be saved from total destruction
i say we who watched from our posts of observation in space lost all hope of ever seeing your planet rescued from the fate it had brought upon itself
and so our interest waned
except for an occasional visit of compassionate scrutiny we consigned your planet to oblivion as far as we personally were concerned
not so your he had made a sacred promise to those who believed and trusted him implicitly
to them he said he would return in power and great glory and this dark orb would be illumined in spite of all efforts of the dark ones to prevent it from happening
we come now in full confidence that this promise is to be kept
we have been summoned to assist in the fulfilling of this promise
knowing from long experience the manifold joys and satisfactions which will be yours when you are released from all those who hold you captive to their evil wills we come with an excess of enthusiasm to lend our support to this crusade
yet we hold ourselves subject at all times to the supervision of our supreme commander
may we all band together in a divinely blessed fellowship and lend our utmost effort to serve well and faithfully until the glorious victory is won and the planet is at last a shining orb in the of the heavens
my love a h t a r note

at the present time there need be no special effort made to communicate with us except at our special request
we ourselves will choose the time place and person we desire to contact
however it will be of immense assistance if you will maintain a feeling of friendly interest and confidence in us and in your mind hold a thought of welcome
our forces find such an atmosphere well adapted to their work as they need these lighted landing fields where they may pause for a moment or two and adapt themselves to the conditions and they must encounter in fulfilling their various assignments
we know each one who is in sympathy with our mission and we would like you to know what a help it is to have these luminous avenues through which to reach the darker areas where much of our work must be carried on
we are deeply grateful for your understanding and your welcome by reason of the fast approaching climax in the antipathy two totally opposed basic life principles it become necessary to provide more than human wisdom strength and skill to overcome the heavy onslaught of misguided or purposely destructive forces
whether this assistance cometh in visible aircraft manned by powerful beings endowed with authority to use forces unknown to mortals or whether the necessary aid be given in ways mysterious and intangible of a men and women fulfilling the missions which brought them to earth at this time shall be given all they need to guarantee their success in carrying out their destined roles
none may compute the wondrous patience and wherewith thy heavenly father hath borne with the of human beings none may even faintly surmise his disappointment at their refusal to accept his overtures of forgiveness and mercy all which cometh to pass of a destructive nature be the result of free choice of the of which to oblivion as far as their residence on this planet be concerned
these can not exist in the new world now being a failure to bring about the establishing of this kingdom of heaven on earth can not be even remotely considered thy master said my kingdom is not of this world
yea but was it not also writ behold i make all things new a new heaven and a new earth wherein shall dwell righteousness this be his promise it be now in process of fulfillment think ye the creator whom the most ignorant concede hath power to intelligently construct the globe ye now inhabit be not able to reconstruct it to conform with a program designed to give a human race the proper environment wherein to utilize newly apprehended forces requiring new conditions for their manifestation
ere the concluding of terrestrial occur ye may expect entirely unrelated sporadic exhibitions by nature releasing long repressed of force sufficient to disrupt a mountain flood a desert sink a country or raise a continent
not in a haphazard or irrational manner will these startling take place
they will follow a detailed plan of procedure whereby those areas best suited to the development of new age projects will be spared or changed to render them fit for greater service to future inhabitants
any on future events must be received according to the knowledge and faith of the reader
a statement may be utter nonsense to thee today yet a month hence appear in quite a different light
let tolerance tincture thy criticism of which to verge on the fantastic
if ye are to be advised of miracles to be achieved during the coming months then must ye admit to thy minds new concepts of natures part in this metamorphosis
a of cleverly concocted substitutes for natures originally perfect provision of foods containing all elements for mans sustenance have flooded thy markets
when correctly compounded by sincere scientists we do not condemn their rightful use
yet hath it deprived nature of a responsibility she will again assume when changing conditions renew the impoverished soil upon which she hath been forced to depend for essential ingredients to and preserving elements into the matchless array of she produce
be not fearful lest the earth be denuded of its fields of golden grain its wealth of trees its vineyards of luscious grapes its of greenest producing all the vegetables one could desire
these and countless other provisions for the temporal needs of all gods little children of the earth shall thrive in the freshly ground which shall respond to natures alchemy
i have spoken so be it greetings from your friends of station share would that i might personally greet each one of you openly avowed friends and express our appreciation of their kindly acceptance of the presence of those of us who come from outer space to aid the dwellers on the planet however since these friends now number so great a multitude and since time is of the essence of our present mission we space men must confine our contacts to those occasions when something may be achieved which will in some way forward our objectives
but i wish to make it clear to you that every new friend we acquire makes our mission a little easier and more effective
it is not our purpose as you have been advised to down upon you as it were and intrude on your affairs in a thoroughly discourteous manner
only in cases of unwarranted abuse of your newly discovered destructive powers will we feel justified in exercising our superior forces to their action seeing it would jeopardize not only your own planet but many dwelling beyond the range of your vision
other than this our assistance will be supplementary
when through the dismissal of vagrant entities not entitled to the hospitality of your planet we are able to mingle freely with you and give you our willing aid in beautifying and rendering your entire globe more tenable by progressive mortals

we can then express in practical and visible ways our respect and admiration for those willing and eager to lend a hand in the transformation which is surely coming to the planet our sincere interest sympathy and love to our friends and those who soon will become our friends there are a few suggestions i would like to make in part to answer many inquiries by those serious in their wish to be of service in establishing the incoming kingdom of heaven on earth and therefore desirous of giving us assistance in our initial efforts to awaken your people to the present peril
while the cleansing process is unavoidable as you well know before a more perfect system can be evolved there are many ways by which the and of such a clearance of offensive debris can be lessened
whereas in certain sections of the globe nothing but a complete sweeping away of every vestige of ancient and their residue will serve the purpose

there are countless instances where a determined effort by individuals groups and organizations to raise their standards in conformity with well known principles of new age living would the necessity for such drastic measures
consider for a moment if you will the reasons for this type of disastrous occurrences
your own history furnishes any number of examples of corruption which led to the downfall of nations or their burial in the ocean depths
has virtuous and humane conduct ever been known to wreck a civilization we are nearing the season when the people of this nation observe a day of thanksgiving
it would appear to be an appropriate time to consider the blessings for which there is reason to be thankful
they consist of a vast array of material possessions which add to your comfort and pleasures in varying degrees
no country in the world has more abundant cause for gratitude to the giver of all good gifts and yet observing the ascending from the mass mind of humanity we find a great preponderance of dissatisfaction even the prayers of the people true gratitude where may it be found you rise up in protest saying how can we give thanks for all the terrible things which are being brought to light

the dishonesty deceit and disloyalty to all which is right and just tell us that why ask so inane a question no one is asking you to say you are thankful for things of that sort but have you thought to thank your heavenly father that they are being brought to light to thank him you are being shown so clearly the evils which must be abolished do you recall learning the multiplication table what has that to do with world conditions i will tell you it has never been denied that five and five make ten
or that five times ten equals fifty these are facts accepted in every country under the sun
on other planets also
you start with one then you build up by addition or multiplication to a hundred a thousand a million and on up
my suggestion is that you start with one

yourself four of our space men will join you in thanking god for your freedom to think and act honorably truthfully justly
other mortals will join you

and with each one there comes the added force from our side

no doubt you and many others have done this not realizing quite how much it meant in the conflict now going on
we have traversed the length and breadth of this and other lands
we have found multitudes of fine upright people
we have taken account of every one of them
we have watched them at home in business at work at play in fortune in misfortune in peaceful times when disaster strikes at all times they are calm resourceful lending courage and strength to the weak and fearful we know thousands upon thousands of such men women and children
we thank god for them paragraph continues were your whole world peopled with persons like them what a thanksgiving day there would be some think of us as destroyers just sit down quietly for a few moments and think of all the things that make you anxious afraid unhappy these are the things we have come to destroy they have thrown everything out of balance off their proper orbit yes i mean physical things the weather the ocean tides the air you breathe the food you eat the very earth on which you walk they have affected all human relationships business government commerce society in general
they are the intangibles which permeate all existence and either destroy or create according to their character
you know their names quite well this coming thanksgiving day we from out of space join you in praising a heavenly father and his beloved son for every true every beautiful creation of his which has not been distorted and rendered vicious by mans misuse
we join you in thanking him that where you are caught in a trap and are not able to put into practice those good impulses and purposes you feel so strongly he is sending mighty forces to your rescue we join you in thanking him that when this sad and season of cleansing is over we may confidently anticipate a joyous time of rebuilding remodeling recreating all things on this earth in perfect harmony and accord with the design and infinitely wise specifications of the master architect of the universe to this glorious and sublime end we pledge our hearts our minds and every power and skill we possess till our sacred mission is completed we thank god our mutual success is assured and we shall see our beloved master the of god crowned king of kings unto him be honor praise and glory now and and his associates from and neighboring planets in loving cooperation with all friends on the planet
a simple word of greeting to all my friends whom i reach through this contact point i join with you in honoring one who almost two ago as you reckon time humbled himself and entered an earthly existence as an ordinary mortal
needless to comment that i had known him previous to this incarnation and had held him in deepest reverence and
how it was possible for any man woman or child to become acquainted with him and fail to give him the devotion of their hearts is a mystery too deep for me to fathom
and so today it is with joy in my own heart that i behold the ever array of those who truly worship him whatever their own particular form of religious observance may be
our forces on will join you with one accord as you endeavor to give expression to the honor due him
may you be granted a new and glorified vision of his majestic grandeur and absolute simplicity of speech and bearing and

oh that you might know the depth of his compassion for the children of the planet to you who love him i can only say did you but know him as i do you would love him more

much more while in a sense each morning marks the beginning of a new day

yet as this last year has sounded the death of an era disastrous to the welfare and happiness of mankind in many ways so the new year just dawning promises an epoch of unparalleled enlightenment and opportunity for mankind to his losses suffered through ignorance or willful and deliberate substitution of mans base desires and destructive will for the divine will and perfect plan of god his creator wearily have the days dragged by while plots and counter plots complicated and multiplied mans problems
we have watched with a horror impossible to repress mans ineffectual attempts to extricate himself from the treacherous of deceptive agreements accepted in apparent good faith only to be ruthlessly trampled under foot when their evil purpose has been achieved
why do we say the tide has now turned because all mankind

enslaved or still capable of recovering their lost heritage of freedom

begin to see for themselves the enormity of their folly in laws to promote their personal progress and consequent possession of all they most earnestly need and desire when will man cease his ridiculous attempts to obstruct the orderly processes of progressive development as set in motion at the commencement of his sojourn on the planet the answer is absurdly simple when he acknowledges to himself that his puny brain and unruly impulses constitute no reliable guide to the acquisition of those tangible and intangible assets without which he can not hope to escape a most terrifying fate might we whom you have named space men share with you the actual facts we have been able to discover by experiment and experience in taking precisely the opposite course of action to that followed by the majority of earth dwellers not but what there have been numerous rash attempts made by incautious believers in divine intelligence wisdom and creative ingenuity to align their lives with this supreme

but to what avail mankind in general would have none of them their fate is all too well known to you shall we share that fate no it is our avowed intention to acquaint you with the results obtained through the consistent and persistent use in a constructive way of the very forces you have used to destroy everything good and beautiful

and now insanely plan to employ to commit suicide on a global scale our homes are built to provide comforts quite beyond your dreams of luxury unattainable their care is a delight for there is no drudgery entertaining guests is robbed of all its problems save the pleasure of devising fresh plans for their enjoyment
i might add they enter into all such plans with zest all our educational facilities are entirely free and so varied are the branches of study and practical application that no student has ever failed to find precisely the type of instruction best suited to his particular bent and ability
prisons reform schools for the insane yes even hospitals are unknown
they would be unoccupied
have these and innumerable other wonders come about through some sort of magic by no means we have worked them out where did we get our instructions from the source which is available to you
i will tell you more should you care to know
ere we proceed with other aspects of new age progress we will spend a little time considering the necessary changes to be made in the habits of a majority of mortals so that they may make the best possible use of new forces released for their benefit
we will the physical body of man to a plant which draw to itself and absorb into its growing organism the precise elements vital to its expanding life principle
if it fail to contact what it in its quest for it soon and die
as of the time of this writing atmospheric envelope be with many elements inimical to the health and development of any human body particularly one delicately attuned to high frequencies
such an one must be constantly against these constituents of the very air they must breathe to sustain life
not alone the air but the seldom recognized subversive thought streams flood the mental atmosphere and drown out the more sensitive of hope and faith
to counteract these and other dangerous to mans wholesome life both physical and spiritual certain purifying processes be constantly employed by the invisible guardians of the planet else would ye perish
ye have observed what ye call an electric storm with its display of lightning and have noted the ensuing of the atmosphere making it a pleasure to draw in deep draughts of purified air
this be but one of countless contrived to lessen the dangers lurking in the ether about thee
other threats to thy health of body and mind for they be woven together like the and warp of a fabric be not so easily apprehended
but this we would indelibly impress upon thy minds a perfect provision hath been made for thine every need under any and circumstances
even in this transition period when ye do encounter many unaccustomed difficulties ye have but to ask for divine assistance to do the will of the heavenly father and often in strange and unexpected ways help will come
refuse to accept the ultimatum of discouragement and defeat urged upon thee by evil forces rampant at this time
pin thy faith to the redemptive forces sent of thy heavenly father to rescue thee from thy perilous position
as an airplane utilize the fuel provided to furnish the power it must have that it may far above the sordid environment of a material world so do thou avail of the means provided for thy flight into the pure atmosphere of divine replenishment
once thou hast contacted these currents of cosmic energy penetrating with ever increasing potency the finer life force all about thee no heavy clogging earth can hold thee in to disease of body mind or spirit
until the day of the great illumination there will unavoidably be a struggle to attain and maintain at all times content and perfect with this divine source of life and love triumphant yet herein lie thy freedom from the fretting exigencies arising from incessant friction the fast receding customs and systems of a decadent and age and that glorious new age of unexplored marvels along every line of constructive and progressive effort
entirely new and fascinating possibilities beckon the dauntless explorer qualified to be the recipient of astounding new inspirations and powers ready and waiting to be bestowed upon him after the necessary cleansing of thy planet be concluded permitting the full influx of marvelous dynamics hitherto by the most imaginative of scientists
greetings from outer space a further word of information for those eager to hear of a state of development not yet reached by your most and fearless explorers into the vast universe of inexhaustible possibilities along every line of progressive evolution
we would make it clear at the outset that we are not seeking to convert you to any formula of religious concept other than the simplest precepts laid down by the divine master the of god
many of these same principles were enunciated by inspired men saints and seers sent of god down through the ages
when the people of refused to accept their teachings and put them into practice they left your earth and transferred their efforts to more receptive minds and hearts on other planes and planets
whether you choose to accept my statement or not it is a fact that there are no closed doors between those who temporarily reside on any plane or planet unless through sheer stupidity ignorance or absurd and unfounded fear you yourselves close and lock the door
quite true the open doorway must always be guarded by strong forces to prevent the entrance of unwelcome visitors
as you know these guards are provided on request
but to return to the more practical aspects of progressed living conditions as enjoyed by the citizens of and similarly enlightened planets as the entire environment and the atmosphere itself has become saturated with thoughts and emotional conducive to clear mental concepts and high ideals you can easily understand that our problems of behavior are practically nonexistent or at least reduced to a minimum
no one on any level of mortal existence and we are mortals in a very real sense enjoys being looked down upon by his fellows
even a criminal aspires to be a sort of
thus it is that having established certain codes of honor in our everyday living and finding it a definitely enjoyable way of life it seldom occurs to the youth of our planet to look for their pleasure in unprofitable pursuits
actually they are too busy seeking to excel in their own chosen profession or avocation frequent tests are held

you would perhaps call them fairs

where many exhibits are on display and trophies awarded for unusual skill originality and dexterity gas demonstrated mechanically artistically mentally or along any line of constructive effort to reach a high and ever higher goal of perfection with suitable recognition of each evidence of progress made often works wonders with those inclined to lag behind
we keep a personal televised record of the progress of every student enrolled in our schools
thus they compete with their own past achievements as well as with others in approximately the same category
with what you term the younger generation reared in this manner you will readily comprehend the way in which they are enabled to apply the principles and utilize the essential properties contained in the magnetic orbit which our home planet
an absurd theory exists in the minds of some earth people we have observed that the type of existence we have attained must be slightly insipid and monotonous
nothing could be farther from the truth our lives are fairly teeming with interest and activities you have a trifling example of my meaning in the constant improvements made in your automobiles and household appliances
even their method of propulsion is constantly subject to revision
then why doubt or wonder that on a planet where war has long since been abolished and all destructive practices are unknown we have evolved a system of which fosters individual initiative contributing to an overall plan whereby each community forms a perfectly coordinating unit in an ever progressing planet of magnificent achievement and beauty
our knowledge our skill our equipment and power to use it all are at your service as you prove yourselves willing to learn and abide by cosmic laws which we obey
in the name of our beloved we bless you and give you our love my word this day pertains to a subject of major importance namely the mission of what ye have erroneously called flying saucers and their occupants
our desire is to have them recognized as speedily as possible as direct emissaries from more advanced planets coming at the of an hierarchy governing this entire universe therefore responsible for the continued existence of the more worthy specimens of the human race living on the planet
the earth by reason of gross stupidity and ignorance of their superior powers men have cast a pall of doubt and distrust about this entire controversy over the reality and purpose of these men from outer space
since they be not subject to the whims of any who would capture and condemn them to torture in a vain attempt to force them to their secret source of power they can not and will not be balked in their mission
will reveal further details of their mission to mankind at his discretion
i have spoken amen so be it greetings from and his flying legions before writing a short resume of what we have to accomplish within a very short time i wish to make doubly sure that everyone reading my statements shall thoroughly understand and accept my sworn that we space men have gain personally by this tedious and difficult task to which we have dedicated ourselves for as long as it may take to bring it to a successful conclusion
our only reward will be the satisfaction anyone feels in achieving a goal
perhaps i should add the supreme pleasure of knowing we have played honorably our role in the forthcoming illumination of this entire globe that your master may assume his over a world completely renovated and restored to its original beauty and even more than that as men comprehend their privileges in the new regime we shall assist in bringing into operation
is it not to your advantage to accept our aid to augment and amplify our efforts some very fine brilliant men are doing this very thing this gives us the incentive we need to continue our attempts to gain the confidence and cooperation of all persons of intelligence and integrity
the method i am employing at the moment may merely arouse your curiosity
but we feel it will take the widest possible variety of manifestations to converge and provide proof sufficiently convincing to permit us to carry out our plans without devastating interference
devastating not to us but to the very ones we are sent to rescue
much as we would like to tell you otherwise truth compels us to warn you the situation is serious be logical be courageous above all obey one of natures most insistent law of we are here to help give us a hand wont you a definite change has come over the minds and hearts of many people in this and to a lesser extent other countries
where heretofore they viewed the appearance of ourselves in our space ships in the light of a curious phenomenon to be regarded with suspicion or shrugged off as irrelevant to current affairs they are now seriously weighing our possible involvement in any coming conflict
i am taking this means to advise you that most assuredly we shall intervene to protect this or any country on the planet which places its trust in god and his son who is his personal representative on this globe
we have been asked to explain the type of cooperation we ask of you
the following suggestions may furnish a clue to our needs
others will occur to you as you ponder upon the situation in your locality
acquire as much information as possible from all reliable sources refusing to give to any doubts cast upon our sincerity and our ability to carry out orders we receive from our
without being insistent pass on such information through every channel open to you
it is imperative that the public be alerted to our presence and its purpose
we might remark that treating it as news rather than placing it in a religious category would avoid disapproval in some quarters
use the telephone private correspondence and casual conversations with friends or even strangers to promote a wholesome interest in the subject

leaving the impression that to deny our existence or doubt our friendly purpose is out of date
encourage the forming of space clubs or small groups to meet at stated intervals for discussion of the latest news available
stress the fact that our first urgent objective must be the removal of the causes necessitating illegitimate use of newly apprehended forces capable of completely disintegrating this planet and doing irreparable damage to all forms of living substance in close proximity thereto
we know the extremity reached in the downward course of under no other circumstances would we have been entreated to undertake our present mission or empowered to intervene and prevent the extermination of the inhabitants of
as the opportunity occurs let your friends know we do not come as adventurers seeking excitement nor as scientists in quest of fresh knowledge what could we learn in your laboratories with their pass equipment or what satisfaction find in the of senseless clashes in mental or physical arenas of action perhaps it would be well to again emphasize the fact that your thoughts and desires as well as your acts create either a very real barrier or point of contact according as you reject our way of life based on the true principles or with our concept of constructive and progressive living
we have passed through a long and tedious process of reappraisal and reevaluation of all life has to offer in the final analysis since first we were favored with wise and patient teachers from outer space
what they did for us ages ago we now offer to do for you it is against every in our code of honor to attempt to force you to accept our services in the capacity of teachers
yet this i can promise in all sincerity should our offer of genuine practical assistance be welcome and the necessary preliminary steps be taken we can and will joyfully pass on to you the knowledge we possess
not only will we do this but we will loan you many of our most expert and experienced teachers in every branch of art and industry to initiate you into the secrets we have tried out and proven one hundred percent effective in creating a world of incredible beauty and endless delight
until you have attained some reasonable concept of such a planet and such a life i fear it would be unwise to extend to you an invitation to visit us in my home on we will continue our description of life on as a fitting prelude to our well earned privilege of serving in our present capacity

not technically designated as teachers but more in the role of elder brothers guiding encouraging and commending any forward step as our comrades of earth fall into line with our steady march toward our goal

the acceptance of our beloved as ruler of planet earth until he mounts his rightful throne of power and glory and is accepted by mankind in a true spirit of loyalty and devotion we are bound by our sacred word of honor to serve in any way which will speed that denouement
let us then proceed to our task of enlightening our friends on as to some aspects of our accustomed mode of home life which has afforded us a maximum of physical delight my scribe questions that term but we do enjoy the sensory pleasures which you fear lost as you make the transition into what you have named the fourth dimension
true it takes a little preparation to enter into this higher environment and participate to the fullest extent in the rare privileges which are ours
however i assure you without our joy in the satisfying of every desire since we have learned the secret of desiring only what is for our highest good goes so far beyond anything you have experienced in your present that we are at a loss to know how to employ phrases strong enough to make it real to you when you hear the full complete harmony of a celestial orchestra or the tones of a melody sung by one you regard as angelic

when a fragrance of unforgettable sweetness is to you from you know not where

when a mental vision is reflected from some beauty spot perhaps on itself 
when there through your entire being ecstasy which sets your heart with love for every creature for every growing thing from tiniest blossom to towering monarch of the forest for every mortal who the great creator

when you enjoy the full flavor of a contribution to your daily direct from natures matchless storehouse of by mans tampering processes

have you not had a tantalizing of the sensory pleasures which many earth people imagine they must forego upon leaving their earth home which has yielded them all too scanty a portion of genuine pleasure yet it is an undeniable fact that we retain in amplified intensified form suited to our more sensitized capacity for enjoyment all you have found truly in your material existence as you call it
we hear and are especially susceptible to aromas

though we have none offensive to our sensitive nostrils
we have clarity of vision extending to realms hidden from your eyes no matter how expert your may be our sense of touch is delicately adjusted to objects cast in a more mold than those you encounter and more easily shattered
in fact they may be altered or even obliterated by the power of thought alone which might be considered a desirable achievement in the case of bits of furnishings i have observed especially in what you name your please i have the greatest possible respect and admiration for anyone who makes the best of their possessions however crude

but i was thinking of what you often refer to as trash kept about for no good reason
i heartily concur in c ns advice to your possessions
i have not touched upon the more spiritual aspects of our lives which to us are precious beyond all else
paragraph continues our lives abound in an appreciation of blessings accruing from a free expression of our highest aspirations
we shall try to take you further into our confidence and our plans for your happiness when next we chat with you
until then my love and my gratitude for your assurances of your confidence and affection received by mail and via thank you and god bless you unto each of thee i address these words of earthly usage that they may be read and understood by thy conscious thinking processes limited by previous thought patterns strongly etched on thy brain which be the physical instrument wherewith thou dost interpret my thoughts in conformity with thy willingness to accept divine truth in its purity of concept
at this culminating period of intense effort on the part of all light forces to enter every smallest opening in mortal minds and hearts with the illuminating power of it be given me the once manifesting in mortal form to give every human being some glimpse of my glorified being until the mass of mankind be brought to a point where they yearn exceedingly to know me or the spirit of truth which motivates my every word and act of what avail would be my manifestation in garb of flesh would it not be accredited by the majority of mankind to some absurd theoretical fantasies invented by minds closed to inspired revelation of truth lo ye do contradict thine own selves one moment you pray for a visible demonstration of the reality of one sent into flesh nigh two thousand years that thus thy faith may be justified
the next moment ye and at anyone who tells thee of beings not from highest heaven but from advanced planets more easily to immature minds sent of the father to lead mankind to a partial understanding of the spiritual laws by which man may progress
my words of truth and life have been discarded by the multitudes as impractical have been distorted have been mouthed in vain repetitions until they have lost their power to reach souls have been relegated to the realm of childish fondness for pleasing tales oft cast aside as they grow to maturity
think these be fitting preparations for my manifestation in mortal guise oh my little children of earth list not to those who of vast stores of knowledge to be acquired through years of arduous study of ponderous tomes designed to confuse thy minds and divert thee from the simple direct leading to true companionship with thy master in thy daily thinking and living one truth lived each hour of every day in conscious with thy master and thy heavenly father bring me closer to thee than endless hours of reasoning about this or that theory concerning life and its purpose
to see me with thy physical eyes would be to thee a boon beyond price and this shall not be denied thee

yet will ye hasten the time of its occurring if ye will but behold me in my spirit manifestation walking by thy side wherever duty thee revealing unto thee through our close understanding in what wise ye may best fulfill the tasks allotted to thee ere ye embarked upon thy present earth span
many now reading my written words be here as ambassadors from far flung vistas of outer space having volunteered to endure the irritations of existence that they might in some wise aid in turning minds toward a mode of living
unto these ones i say lo i shall give unto thee in a way ye be not expecting a true vision of thy master and his boundless love for thee thou choose to see me clothed in radiance of glory so dazzling you could not approach me in thine earthly or may i come unto thee in seamless robe of perfect understanding of thine own earthly circumstances and problems choose thee the latter i pray thee and in due season thy faithful service performed in my name and by my power shall lead thee to the hour appointed by our heavenly father when thou see thy master lo this shall be thine own morning of joyous recognition of thine ever present friend and counselor thy prince of peace sends an greeting what could a mere space man add to our masters message which would not detract from the beautiful simplicity of his words we who come as messengers and from the powers of darkness now your planet beseech you to heed the note of warning concealed in this message and step up all your own to a level where you can bear the radiance streaming from the glorified cross which is the symbol of our risen lord forever freed from the limitations of earth life
it was said of old when he shall appear we shall be like him for we shall see him as he is i wish to assure you this is literally true as we have proven for as we visualized the divine purity of his life and teachings as we made our lives conform with that inspired vision we reached a point in our understanding where we were able to see him not only with our spiritual eyes but with the sensitized lenses of our physical eyes until now i can tell you in all truthfulness we enjoy the almost inconceivable privilege of entertaining him on many occasions when he visits some of you may question this saying the spirit is indwelling in each of us this we gladly concede is true and this spirit in many guises on all planes and planets
the spirit of kindness of compassion of mercy of joy of beauty of love in all its multitudinous forms

all of these are reflections of the spirit which our master so magnificently presented for our during his sojourn on the earth
each mortal seeking to follow in his footsteps acts as a magnet to draw to earth those qualified to assist in restoring that perfection of both material and spiritual beauty it originally possessed in the mind of the creator it is our great privilege to aid in this restoration under the direction of our master and yours the a glorious to you in which we shall share with all the hosts of heaven rejoicing at your response to the call

come up higher were it possible for thee to see with thy physical eyes or to retain in thy physical brain the memory of scenes at this moment taking place on astral planes in close proximity to the earth plane then would ye be relieved of much of thy burden of anxiety concerning the outcome of violent clashes now occurring within sight and sound of thine eyes and ears as of thy conscious knowledge
soon thy mind will release to thee faint of changes even now in preparation on the earth
yea of a truth they come into manifestation first upon the astral planes before in earthly form through strange diversities of circumstance
those most strenuously opposing their advent do frequently act quite unwittingly as their strongest proponents
seeing the frightful ravages wrought by devotees of diabolical dogmas many turn away and apply themselves to plans for their eradication
in this effort they will receive superhuman assistance
following the demolition of destructive agencies animate and inanimate ye will concede the obvious need for a well implemented program devised to fire the imagination and arouse the aspirations of every member of the human family in accord with their own individual ability to contribute to the overall plan every faculty possessed by mortals may be fitted into the mosaic of new age activities
in this way those formerly suffering frustration and defeat will feel a new surge of confidence in their competence to follow their clearly indicated aptitude for certain types of service in research invention mechanical skill or whatever their talent may be to a successful conclusion
to this end hath it been ordained that many doors to knowledge hitherto barred to mortals will be opened to those who through trials oft accounted unjust and rightly so have nevertheless proven themselves to be worthy to receive the boon they long have sought
to them will be given the keys to mysteries long veiled from mortal eyes awaiting the propitious time for their revealing
devious methods will be employed for the transmission of what be to many startling new facts regarding invisible forces extremely powerful and yet how wisely impossible to contact or even apprehend from an intellectual standpoint save by one elevated to a high level of spiritual awareness of the inviolable sanctity of any knowledge touching on energies emanating from divinity itself not in any and haphazard fashion will the aids to the acquisition of such knowledge be provided
many factors will enter into the bestowal of such gifts chief of which will be the character of the one in quest of any particular type of information and his purpose
these qualifications may best be ascertained by a survey of his objectives and achievements in past
such an inspection would necessarily be done by a very advanced mentor or specialist appointed for the task
the person whose past record be subjected to such scrutiny be not consulted or conscious of the procedure
we might the comment that many highly evolved men and women now on earth have undergone such an investigation and have been approved for admittance to the of awaiting only the moment of the worlds emancipation from the domination of destructive forces to begin their work with their students
this active partnership between one in close touch with the material world and one in direct contact with knowledge will be one of the major marvels of the new age
the person privileged to enjoy such a partnership may not be conscious of such assistance but may attribute the sudden flashes of inspiration to intuition but will surely recognize it as coming from a source higher than their own mind
however it may be said in passing that in almost every instance there will eventually evolve so close a companionship that it will be possible for the two coworkers to visit back and forth from the fourth to the third dimension at will much to their mutual advantage and enjoyment amen so be it a friendly message from another link has been forged between those residing upon your planet and the galaxy of shining as you see them which compose the glittering you see above you
actually of course it completely the globe whereon dwell those looking at nighttime from their particular section of the earth
oh that all peoples could but realize how the by these illumined stars no matter how far distant they may be as of earthly computation provides the ultimate evidence that this dark planet may in time reach a similar stage of evolution unless man himself decrees otherwise could this fact be brought home to them then would they accept a kindly word of counsel from the inhabitants of these and other progressed spheres and greatly profit by their proven knowledge of the action of universal cosmic laws when correctly employed in a constructive manner
much has been written of late concerning certain visible contacts made by space men or with inhabitants of the earth residing in different areas of the planet
their conversation is often alluded to as being carried on by thought transference or through the use of telepathy
this brings to light a possibility given little consideration by those in quest of further information regarding any who have observed flying unidentified objects at incredible rates of speed
so have their minds become with thoughts of invasion by enemy forces seen or unseen that they reject the idea of a peaceful invasion or by friendly neighbors wishing to courteously welcome them into the cooperative fraternity of constellations of celestial bodies peopled by those enjoying a type of intensely interesting existence impossible of attainment save by those who live in accord with cosmic law
it is our desire to attract your attention and invite your confidence through visible manifestations of various kinds
however do not for one moment conclude that this is our chief objective
god forbid our revered and beloved
the did many mighty works when he lived as a man among mortals yet his real mission was to teach men the meaning of life both here and hereafter
and so we rejoice that our vital mission to is being recognized by many who meet and talk with us during the hours when their physical bodies are wrapped in slumber
the ideas the truths disclosed in these nocturnal conferences are stored in their
minds and our new friends later work them into the patterns of their daily lives
as a matter of fact it is of far more practical assistance in hastening the planets delayed illumination to change the into the right channels than it is for us to transmit knowledge of a scientific nature
science perverted to destructive purposes acts as a deadly menace science directed into channels of dynamic activity which will lift the human race to a new a higher type of existence in accord with its destiny will bring into reality that golden age now dawning on the consciousness of all awakened souls
our newly consummated contact with such souls is of profound significance to us and promises to play a major role in the emancipation of from the domination of utterly subversive forces whether visible or invisible we pledge you our support in each and every constructive effort in every field of endeavor looking toward the illumination of your spirits minds

yes and the very earth on which your feet tread may our mission to be blessed with a speedy success by the father of us all and his beloved son the speaking for a mighty army of space men now in active service
although the scientific discoveries and inventions of the new age will cause endless amazement and discussion over the new methods introduced a much more important phase will radically change all of mans relations with his
we speak of the lectures if ye would so name them which will be given in all parts of the world upon any subject pertinent to that particular section and the inhabitants thereof
these demonstrations of practical ways in which newly apprehended forces may be utilized to laborious tasks and increase the comfort and happiness of the common people will be arranged by the leaders appointed
these special leaders will not be chosen by the people since their duties will not be of a judiciary character
they will be persons of high intelligence and spiritual enlightenment yet withal keenly aware of the vital necessity for bringing these attributes into play in a realistic way during the reconstruction period of the worlds regeneration
these leaders will make all arrangements for the addresses but they will not be the speakers
one of the very surprising incidents of the new era will be the introduction of teachers from the now invisible realms
these visiting instructors will be experts chosen for their intimate knowledge and experience along the various lines in which their audiences desire to excel
they will be garbed in accord with the customs of those who come to learn of them
they will speak their language
it will not be some foreigner intruding to instruct in the use of strange new implements and stranger modes of dress and behavior
it will be like one of their very own people pointing out to them better ways of managing their own affairs that they may minimize and finally abolish evils long existent
little by little through their own efforts in response to suggestions given their entire mode of living will be elevated to a higher standard than they have ever known
i speak not of deliberately retrogressive nations
they will no longer the earth
those of whom i speak are inherently honest and honorable members of the human race who have been repressed and retarded not of their own volition but through forced to men more powerful and aggressive but far less amenable to higher instruction and consequent progress
they will soon emerge from the apathy induced by domination to the point of slavery and their minds once awakened will eagerly accept and put into actual practice the principles explained and new methods applicable to their daily tasks
by utilizing moving pictures taken on other planets demonstrating these improved techniques within the compass of their understanding then patiently answering questions regarding the use of unfamiliar implements they will readily respond and cooperate
we use these downtrodden people to illustrate this system of teaching
by speakers from high planes and other planets to give detailed instructions on a multitude of different topics fully illustrated desired changes in customs and general behavior of the populace will be quickly achieved
the very novelty of such an experience will lend interest and there will be a certain prestige attached to adopting the advice of these from hitherto unknown sections of the universe
even the simplest of counsel will acquire fresh significance when given by so distinguished a of speakers this plan will augment and greatly simplify the work of those mortals who will be called upon to conduct classes for the enlightenment of willing but ignorant aspirants wishing to qualify for new age living
none will be asked to sit in any dark and poorly ventilated room to meet these guests from realms long regarded as invisible
nay they will appear among ye as well attired as and ye will so welcome them with unaffected this be a most pleasant occurrence to contemplate and it shall surely come to pass it is plainly depicted on the screen of amen so be it a most gratifying change is now taking place in the general attitude of the people of the earth
no longer do great masses of the inhabitants of this and other countries regard our as threatening their safety of body and property but adopt a more sane and cooperative course of action showing willingness to give us the benefits of a doubt as to our intentions
we can not but feel somewhat amused at times over the pride exhibited by those who have succeeded in registering and whistling sounds on their poorly constructed receiving instruments were they familiar with the forces we employ in sending these signals which are not in most instances intended to be translated into the language of any particular country we could soon devise a method of communication satisfactory to everyone concerned
i speak of a mechanism
as the matter now stands it is we who must acquaint ourselves with the curious combinations of sounds transmitting to your minds the ideas to be conveyed
these vary so completely in different sections of the globe as to present quite a problem to our men
were you conversant with the art of thought transference as we know and practice it our friendly intercourse would lose much of its present difficulty and become a pleasing possibility
our use of this type of conversation has been developed over uncounted ages of constant practice
when we employ your method of using appropriate words to convey our meaning it is to us as tedious as if you had to spell aloud or write each word you wished to speak which you would find quite tiresome

the latter often necessary in talking with the deaf
thus not intending any disrespect we must perforce regard earth dwellers somewhat in the light of deaf people who must be reached through the medium of sight
we ourselves have to a great extent dispensed with sound so many noises to which you are accustomed therefore do not seem annoying are to our sensitized ears almost as you would express it
you marvel that our space ships operate that we appear and disappear without the least sound or at most a sound caused by contact with your dense atmosphere
can you not understand we must learn to do what we have in mind using the crude elements at your disposal since you have little or no knowledge of the existence of forces we find so perfectly suited to our purposes we fully realize how impossible it is for you to duplicate our accustomed modes of procedure in all the practical details of our ordinary daily lives with your present limited laboratory of essences suited only to the present atmospheric conditions surrounding your planet
and so my friends we are forced to acquaint ourselves with your irksome limitations and adapt ourselves to your rather trying conditions and in many other ways that we may be able to render the assistance asked of us in the present transition of your darkened planet into an orb of shining splendor that this transition must take place simultaneously on the material the mental and the soul levels irrespective of purely religious concepts poses many seemingly insurmountable difficulties
that which can not because of its very nature or will not by reason of mans free choice be transmuted into a higher rate of vibration

must through natural laws similar to the familiar law of gravitation sink to a level it from that portion of the earth and its inhabitants capable of rising to a finer type of existence compatible with the vastly accelerated or quickened since it is more alive condition in which you will soon find yourselves if you are able to visualize such a marvelously joyously revised edition of your present doleful life in toto

then i greet you as future residents of the new world in a new age on the of about three in the afternoon the bishop of and m de being present was brought from his prison to the church of
in his parish to be present at the
all the possessed were there likewise
and as the accused and his partisans declared that the possessions were mere he was ordered to be himself the and the stole was presented to him
he could not refuse and therefore taking the stole and the ritual he received the pastoral benediction and after the creator had been sung commenced the in the usual form
but where he should haughtily have given commands to the demon instead of saying i command he said vos that is i am constrained by you
the bishop sharply reprimanded him and as he had said that some of the possessed understood he was allowed to in
at the same time the demon cried out by the mouth of sister eh speak or any language you like i will answer
at these words he became confused and could not say anything more
to behave thus or to acknowledge the truth of the accusation is one and the same thing but other circumstances strengthened this certainty
any man whose own writing testifies against him is lost
now this is what experienced
the devils in several instances confessed four he had entered into
this word pact is somewhat equivocal
it may mean either the document by which a man gives himself to the devil or the physical symbols whose application will produce some particular effects in consequence of the pact
here is an example of each case
pact or magical characters whereby he gave himself to was as lord and master i you as my god and promise to serve you all my life
i every other god and all other saints the apostolic and church its sacraments with all prayers that may be said for me and i promise to do all the evil i can
i the holy oil and the water of baptism together with all the merits of and his saints and should i fail to serve and adore you and do homage to you thrice daily i abandon to you my life as your due
these characters were recognised as being in own hand
now here is a specimen of the other kind of pact or magical charm
it was composed of the flesh of a heart extracted in an assembly of magicians held at in of the ashes of a holy that had been burnt and of something else which the least decency forbids me to name
a most convincing proof of guilt is that one of the devils declared he had marked him in two parts of his body
his eyes were bandaged and he was examined by eight doctors who reported they had found two marks in each place that they had inserted a needle to the depth of an inch without the criminal having felt it and that no blood had been drawn
now this is a roost decisive test
for however deeply a needle be buried in such marks no pain is caused and no blood can be extracted when they are magical signs
but if the devils overcome by the at times gave evidence against the criminal at others they seemed to conspire to him still more under the semblance of an apparent justification
thus several of the possessed spoke in his favour and some even went so far as to confess that they had calumniated him
indeed the mother superior herself one day when m de was in the convent stripped herself to her shift and with a rope round her neck and a candle in her hand stood for two hours in the middle of the yard although it was raining heavily and when the door of the room in which m de was seated was opened she threw herself on her knees before him declaring she of the crime she had committed in accusing who was innocent
she then withdrew and fastened the rope to a tree in the garden attempting to hang herself but was prevented by the other nuns
when the devil played these kind of tricks they forced him to by calling on him to take present in the as witness of the truth of his statement which he never dared to do
what criminals could ever be condemned if such were not deemed sufficient the certainty of the possessions the depositions of two priests who accused him of sacrilege those of the nuns declaring that they saw him day and night for four months though the gates of the convent were kept locked the two women who bore witness that he offered to make one of them princess of the magicians the evidence of sixty other witnesses his own embarrassment and confusion on so many occasions the disappearance of his three brothers who had fled and were never seen again his pact and the magic characters that were afterwards burnt with him all these placed his guilt beyond doubt
the trial being completed and the magician duly convicted there only remained to sentence the evil
the commissioners assembled at the convent and it was noticed that there was not the slightest difference of opinion among all the fourteen judges though they had never seen or known one another
they were all agreed as to the penalty to be inflicted and having pronounced their sentence they were filled with joy and their conscience was perfectly at rest
it was as if god whose honour was so interested in this affair had intended to give them this consolation
no one among the or indeed among all honest men failed to applaud the sentence on
it was as follows we have declared and declare the said and convicted of the crimes of magic and possession occurring through his act in the persons of certain nuns of this town of and other women together with other crimes resulting therefrom
for reparation whereof we have condemned and do condemn the said to make honorable a rope round his neck holding in his hand a burning torch of the weight of two pounds before the principal gate of saint du march and before that of saint of the said town and there on his knees to ask pardon of god the king and justice and that done to be led to the public square of to be there tied to a stake which for that purpose shall be erected in the said square and his body to be there burnt with the and magical inscriptions now in custody of the court together with the manuscript book written by him against the of priests and his ashes to be scattered to the wind
we have declared all his property forfeited and confiscated to the crown less a sum of livres which shall be expended in the purchase of a copper plate on which shall be engraved the present sentence and the same shall be placed in a prominent position in the said church of st there to be preserved for ever
and before this present sentence shall be carried out we order that the said shall be put to the question ordinary and extraordinary to discover his accomplicespronounced at on the said and executed the of august
in execution of this sentence he was taken to the court of justice of
his sentence having been read to him he earnestly begged m de and the other commissioners to mitigate the of their sentence
m de replied that the only means of inducing the judges to moderate the penalties was to declare at once his accomplices and by some act of repentance for his past crimes to implore divine mercy
the only answer he gave was that he had no accomplices which was false for there is no magician but must be accompanied by others
for the last forty days the commissioner had placed at his side two monks to convert him
but all was in vain
nothing could touch this hardened sinner
it is true however that the conversion of a magician is so rare an occurrence that it must be placed in the rank of miracles
i am not astonished says one who was present at his nor at his refusing to acknowledge himself guilty of magic both under torture and at his execution for it is known that magicians promise the devil never to confess this crime and he in return their heart so that they go to their death stupid and altogether to their misfortunes
before being put to the torture the prisoner was addressed by father a man of great faith chosen by the bishop of to exorcise the instruments of torture as is always done in the case of magicians in order to induce him to repent
every one shed tears except the prisoner
m de also spoke to him together with the lieutenant of but notwithstanding their efforts they made no impression
this determined m de to try the effects of torture
the boots were applied and the judge repeated his questions as to his accomplices
he always replied that he was no magician though he had committed greater crimes than that
questioned as to what crimes he replied crimes of human and added that were he guilty of magic he would be less ashamed of that than of his other crimes
this speech was ridiculous especially in the mouth of a priest who must know better than a layman that of all crimes the greatest is that of sorcery
torture drew from him nothing but cries or rather sighs from the depth of his bosom unaccompanied by tears though the had him according to the ritual to weep if he were innocent but if guilty to remain
though he was very thirsty he several times refused to drink holy water when presented to him
at length pressed to drink he took a few drops with glaring eyes and a horrible look on his face
never in the greatest agony of torture did he mention the name of or of the holy virgin save when repeating words he was ordered to speak and then only in so cold a manner and with such constraint that he horrified the assistants
he never cast his eyes on the image of nor on that of the virgin which were opposite to him and they were offered to ban in vain whereupon the judges remonstrated with him
they were still more when they tried to make him say the prayer which every good addresses to his guardian angel especially in great extremities and he said he did not know it
such was his conduct under torture in such a crisis every feeling of religion would be awakened in an ordinary man
his legs were then washed and placed near the fire to restore circulation he then began to talk to the guards joking and laughing and would have gone on had they allowed him
he spoke neither of receiving the sacrament of nor of imploring gods pardon
they had given him for a confessor father who asked him if he did not wish to confess
he replied that he had done so the previous after which he sat down and dined with the same appetite as usual drank three or four glasses of wine and spoke of all kinds of things except of god
instead of listening to what was said to him for the good of his soul he made speeches he had prepared beforehand as if he were preaching
they consisted in complaints as to the pain in his legs and of a feeling of about his head in asking for something to drink or to eat and in begging that he might not be burnt alive
when he was carried to the courthouse where the holy fathers began to prepare him for death he pushed back with his hand a crucifix which was presented to him and muttered between his teeth some words which were not heard
his guards witnessing this action were and told the monk not to offer him the crucifix again since he rejected it
he recommended himself to no ones prayers neither before nor during the execution of the as he passed through the streets turning his head on one side and the other to see the people it was noticed that he said twice with an appearance of vanity pray god for me and that those to whom he spoke were among whom was an
the monk who was with him him to say in me
turned his back on him and said with contempt in me
having reached the place of execution the fathers redoubled their charitable solicitude and pressed him most earnestly to be converted to god at that moment offered him the crucifix and placed it over his mouth and on his chest he never deigned to look at it and once or twice even turned away he shook his head when holy water was offered him
he seemed eager to end his days and in haste to have the fire lighted either because he expected not to feel it or because he feared he might be weak enough to name his accomplices or perhaps as is believed in fear lest pain should extract from him a renunciation of his master
for the devil to whom magicians give themselves body and soul so thoroughly masters their mind that they fear him only and expect and hope for nothing save from him
therefore did protest placing his hand on his heart that he would say no more than he had already said
at last seeing them set fire to the he feared they did not intend to keep their promise to him but wished to burn him alive and uttered loud executioner then advanced as is always done to him but the flames suddenly sprang up with such violence that the rope caught fire and he fell alive among the burning
just before this a strange event happened
in the midst of this mass of people notwithstanding the noise of so many voices and the efforts of the who shook their in the air to frighten them a flight of pigeons flew round and round the stake
partisans impudent to the end said that these innocent birds came in default of men as witnesses of his innocence others thought very differently and said that it was a troop of demons who came as sometimes happens on the death of great magicians to assist at that of whose certainly deserved to be honoured in this manner
his friends however called this hardness of heart constancy and had his ashes collected as if they were they who did not believe in such things for the looked upon him as one of themselves especially when they noticed that he never called on the virgin nor looked on the crucifix
thus did he close his criminal career by a death which horrified not only but even the more of the party
but the end of the magician was not the end of the effects of his sorcery and the possessions far from ceasing as had been hoped continued for a time
god permitted that a great number of those who had been connected with the affair should be more or less vexed by demons
the civil lieutenant was seized with such his mind gave way and he never recovered
the the surgeon who had sounded the marks which the devil had impressed on the magician priest suffering from extraordinary troubles was of course said by the p friends of to be the victim of remorse
here are the particulars of the death of this surgeon one night as he was returning about ten from visiting a sick man walking with a friend and accompanied by a man carrying a lantern he cried all of a sudden like a man from a dream ah there is what do you want at the same time he was seized with trembling
the two men took him back to his home while he continued to talk to whom he thought he had before his eyes
he was put to bed filled with the same illusion and shaking in every limb
he only lived a few days during which his state never changed
he died believing the magician was still before him and making efforts to keep him at arms length
father the worthy monk who had assisted the possessed in their sufferings was himself attacked some time after the death of the priest
feeling the first symptoms he determined to go to dame des whose chapel served by the priests of the oratory is held in great veneration in and its neighbourhood
m de who was going into the country gave him a seat in his carriage
he had heard speak of his state and knew that he was tormented by the devil but he nevertheless joked about the matter when all of a sudden rolling along a perfectly level road the carriage turned over with the wheels in the air without any one being in any way hurt
the next day they continued their voyage to when the carriage again turned over in the same way in the middle of the rue du de which is perfectly smooth and leads to the chapel of
this holy monk afterwards experienced the greatest from the demons who at times deprived him of sight and at times of memory they produced in him violent fits of nausea dulled his intelligence and worried him in numerous ways
at length after being tried by so many evils god called him to him
five years later died of the same disease father
he was a holy monk a celebrated preacher gifted with a judicious mind great piety and a profound humility
a laborious much feared by the devils he had preferred that painful duty generally little sought for to the fame of preaching and had devoted himself to the service of the possessed of
the demons irritated at his constancy determined to possess his body
but god never allowed him to be entirely possessed
nevertheless his cruel enemies succeeded in attacking his senses to a certain extent
they cast him to the ground they cursed and swore out of his mouth they caused him to put out his tongue and hiss like a serpent they filled his mind with darkness seemed to crush out his heart and overwhelmed him with a thousand other
on the day of they attacked bins more violently than ever was to have preached but was too ill to attempt it
but his confessor ordered the devil to leave him at liberty and commanded the father to ascend the pulpit
he did so and preached more eloquently than if he had prepared his sermon for weeks
this was his last sermon
he performed mass for two or three days more and then took to his bed to rise no more
the demons caused him pains the violence of which none knew but he they shrieked and howled out of his mouth but he remained clear headed
the following morning the monks saw that god had given rein to the powers of hell and had determined to abandon to them the life of the monk and he himself begged that extreme unction should be administered to him when they should see that he was passing away
about twelve a demon who was being declared that father was at his last gasp
they hastened to see if it were true be was dying so the sacrament was administered to him
he died and received the crown he had gained by with hell so courageously sustained
the opinion of his attracted an enormous crowd to his funeral
a pronounced his funeral and a worthy epitaph was engraved on his tomb
another matter that should be mentioned is that when extreme unction was administered to him the devils driven away by the sacrament were forced to leave him
but they did not go far for they entered the body of another excellent monk who was present and whom they possessed
they vexed him at first by violent and horrible and at the moment of death they cried horribly he is dead as if they would say it is all over no more hope of this soul at the same time casting themselves on the other monk they worked him so horribly that in spite of the many that held him he kept kicking in the most violent manner towards the deceased
he had to be carried away
father a had succeeded father he too had his trials
the demons used to threaten him out of the mouth of the mother superior who was under his care
once in the presence of the bishop of the demon took up his position on the face of the nun suddenly he disappeared and attacked the father made him grow pale sat on his chest and stopped his voice but soon obeying the order of another he returned to the nun spoke through her mouth and showed himself extremely hideous and horrible on her face and the father returning to the fight continued his duties as if he had never been attacked
in one afternoon he was thus attacked and released seven or eight times but these assaults were followed by others still more violent so that in his he seemed to be struck with violent interior blows borne to earth and violently shaken by his adversary he remained in this state sometimes half an hour sometimes an hour
the other applied the holy sacrament to the places where he felt the demons sometimes to his chest sometimes to his head
when the devil left him he reappeared on the face of the mother where the monk with holy vengeance pursued him and constrained him to adore the holy sacrament
once the devil threw him out of a window on to the rock where stands the convent of the and broke one of his thighs
after having sustained during many years with perfect patience and resignation these terrible trials he was freed from them and at length died in the of sanctity
as to the mother superior towards the end of the year something happened to her of a most extraordinary nature
lord came to accompanied by two other
he brought the a letter from the archbishop of tours ordering them to his lordship as much as possible
the superior in the midst of a stretched out her left arm and the name of appeared on it written in capital letters
the report of this event was signed by the
lord hastened to his heresy embraced the ecclesiastical career and under another name settled in where he lived many years
he is mentioned in the memoirs of de
at the beginning of on twelfth night father resolved to compel the last demon that remained in the mother superior to adore
he had the lady tied to a bench
the drove the demon into a fury and instead of obeying he a multitude of and blasphemies against the three persons of the holy against and against his holy mother so that one would he horrified to read them
the father knew that he was about to come out and had the lady unbound
after and horrible father pressed him more and more with the holy sacrament in his hand and ordered him in to write the name of on the hand
raising her left arm into the air the fiend redoubled his cries and howls and in a last issued from the lady leaving on her hand the holy name maria in letters so perfectly formed that no human hand could imitate them
the lady felt herself free and full of joy and a was sung in honour of the event
such is the true story of the possession of the nuns of and of the condemnation of so different from the false accounts hitherto published
even those who do not blush to deny the truth of possessions need only notice that the human race has always believed and still believes that there are intelligent creatures in existence other than man and almost similar to those whom the have always represented as gods of evil or genii like the demons believed in by and the belief in possession having in it no longer anything repugnant will seem at once to them not only possible but probable
to believe that was condemned and executed we must blindly believe hundreds of things which revolt common sense
one of the writers for example after having said in a thousand different ways that the possession of the nuns of was a mere and horrible farce confesses that it is impossible to conceive human beings and especially women driving a priest to a horrible death by such a series of feigned possessions
