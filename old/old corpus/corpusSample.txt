II.
The conditionally arising apparent "world" is a context of opposites, "differences",
separateness, change, diminishment, timed cessation, untimely ending, timeless death--and
always repetitions.
The conditionally arising apparent "universe" will (apparently) expand indefinitely, into a
gray eventless state--but, coincidently, "it" inherently (and paradoxically) always coincides with
the seed and characteristic of merely repetition (or of perpetual re-"emergence", same as was,
and same as same, and same as merely seeming seems).
The conditionally arising apparent "individual" (or embodied "self", or psycho-physical
"entity") is inherently not-separate from the conditionally arising apparent "world"--and,
therefore, the conditionally ari63sing apparent "individual" (or psycho-physically embodied "point of
view") is a context exactly in the mode of the conditionally arising apparent "world".
Coincidently, the conditionally arising apparent "individual" (or psycho-physical "selfentity", or psycho-physically embodied "point of view"), like the conditionally arising46apparent
"universe", inevitably changes toward and into death, while, also, paradoxically, "it" always
repeats "itself" (and, thus, perpetually re-"emerges", as "it" was, and same, and seeming as "it"
seems, and seeming same as merely seeming seems to seem).
The Tacit and Direct (or Always Prior) Self-Realization of The Inherently egoless
Transcendental Spiritual (and Self-Evidently Divine) Self-Nature, Self-Condition, and Self-State
of Reality (Itself) Is The Intrinsic Transcending—and, at Perfect last, The Absolute (and
Transcendental Spiritual) Outshining—of the conditionally (or psycho-physically) arising
apparent "self-entity" and the totality of conditionally arising apparent "world" and "universe".

The only-by-Me Revealed and Given Seventh Way (or Inherently Perfect Reality-Way) of
Adidam Is The Way of Perfect Outshining.


This is what I heard:

At one time the Buddha was in the Amra Gardens in the city of Vaishali, accompanied by a multitude of leading monks numbering eight thousand. There were also thirty-two thousand bodhisattvas, all known to the assembly, persons who had carried out all the basic practices of great wisdom. Sustained by the might and supernatural powers of the Buddhas, they accepted and upheld the correct Law in order to guard the citadel of the Dharma. They knew how to roar the lion's roar, and their fame resounded in the ten directions. Without waiting to be asked, they befriended others and brought them comfort. They ensured the continuance and prosperity of the Three Treasures, making certain that these never expired. They conquered and subdued the ill will of the devils and curbed the non-Buddhist doctrines.

All were spotless and pure, having long ago rid themselves of snares and obstructions; their minds constantly resided in a state of unhindered emancipation. Their mindfulness, meditation, retention of the teachings, and eloquence never faltered, and of almsgiving, keeping of the precepts, forbearance, assiduousness, meditation, wisdom, and the power to employ expedient means, there was not one they were deficient in.

They had learned to accept the fact that there is nothing to be grasped at, no view of phenomena to be entertained. They knew how to respond compliantly to others and to turn the unregressing wheel of the Law. Expert in comprehending the characteristics of phenomena, able to understand the capacities of living beings, they towered over the others of the great assembly and had learned to be fearful of nothing.

With their merits and wisdom they disciplined their minds; they adorned their bodies with auspicious signs, ranking foremost in aspect and form, but rejected all worldly embellishments. In fame and renown they soared higher than Mount Sumeru; their profound faith was diamondlike in its firmness. The jewels of their Dharma shone everywhere, raining down sweet dew, and among the assembly the sound of their words was the most subtle and wonderful of all.

They had plumbed the depths of dependent origination and cut off all erroneous views, no longer entertaining the concepts either of being or nonbeing. In expounding the Law they were fearless as roaring lions, and their disquisitions on it rolled forth like thunder. There was no measuring them, for they had passed beyond measure. In seeking out the jewels of the Dharma, they were like practiced pilots at sea. They had mastered all the profound and subtle meanings of the doctrines and were expert in perceiving the past and future existences of living beings and the workings of their minds.

They came close to equaling the freely exercised wisdom of the Buddha, the unparalleled one, his ten powers, his fearlessness, and his eighteen unshared properties. Though they had firmly closed the gate to all manner of evil existences, yet they allowed themselves to be born in the five lower realms, manifesting themselves there so that they might act as great physician kings, adroitly healing the ills of others, doling out whatever medicine suited the ailment, and insuring that the patient took it as prescribed.

Countless benefits-all these they had acquired; countless Buddha lands- all these they had made marvelously pure. No one saw or listened to them without profiting thereby, and no action of theirs was ever performed in vain. Such was the manner in which all merits adhered to them.

The names of the bodhisattvas were Bodhisattva Viewing Equality, Bodhisattva Viewing Inequality, Bodhisattva Viewing Equality and Inequality, Bodhisattva Meditation Freedom King, Bodhisattva Dharma Freedom King, Bodhisattva Dharma Forms, Bodhisattva Shining Forms, Bodhisattva Shining Adornment, Bodhisattva Great Adornment, Bodhisattva Jeweled Accumulation, Bodhisattva Accumulation of Eloquence, Bodhisattva Jeweled Hand, Bodhisattva Jeweled Seal Hand, Bodhisattva Constantly Raised Hand, Bodhisattva Constantly Extended Hand, Bodhisattva Constantly Commiserating, Bodhisattva Joyful Capacity, Bodhisattva Joyful King, Bodhisattva Eloquent Sound, Bodhisattva Storehouse of Emptiness, Bodhisattva Holder of the Jeweled Torch, Bodhisattva Jeweled Valor, Bodhisattva Jeweled View, Bodhisattva of Indra's Net, Bodhisattva Bright Net, Bodhisattva Unconditioned View, Bodhisattva Wisdom Accumulation, Bodhisattva Jeweled Supremacy, Bodhisattva Heavenly King, Bodhisattva Devil Defeating, Bodhisattva Lightning Virtue, Bodhisattva Freedom King, Bodhisattva Merit Forms and Adornments, Bodhisattva Lion's Roar, Bodhisattva Thunder Sound, Bodhisattva Mountain Form Smiting Sound, Bodhisattva Rutting Elephant, Bodhisattva White Rutting Elephant, Bodhisattva Constant Exertion, Bodhisattva Never Resting, Bodhisattva Wonderful Birth, Bodhisattva Flower Adornment, Bodhisattva Perceiver of the World's Sounds, Bodhisattva Gainer of Great Authority, Bodhisattva of Brahma's Net, Bodhisattva Jeweled Staff, Bodhisattva Unsurpassed, Bodhisattva Adorned Land, Bodhisattva Golden Locks, Bodhisattva Gemmed Locks, Bodhisattva Maitreya, and Bodhisattva Dharma Prince Manjushri. There were thirty-two thousand bodhisattvas such as these

There were also ten thousand Brahma kings, Shikhin and others, who had come from the other four continent worlds to visit the place where the Buddha was and listen to the Dharma. There were also twelve thousand Indras who had come from the other four continent worlds to take a seat in the gathering. In addition, there were other heavenly beings of great authority and power, as well as dragons, spirits, yakshas, gandharvas, asuras, garudas, kimnaras, mahoragas, and others, all come to take a seat in the assembly. Also arrived to take seats in the assembly were the various monks, nuns, laymen, and laywomen.

At that time the Buddha, reverently surrounded by this multitude of countless hundreds and thousands of beings, expounded the Law for them. He was like Mount Sumeru, king of mountains, rising up out of the great sea. Resting at ease in his lion's seat clustered with jewels, he shed his radiance over all the great throng gathered there.

At that time a man named Jeweled Accumulation, son of a wealthy man of the city of Vaishali, along with five hundred other sons of wealthy men, had come to the place where the Buddha was, all of them bearing parasols adorned with the seven treasures. Bowing their heads in obeisance before the feet of the Buddha, they joined in offering their parasols as alms to the Buddha.

The Buddha with his supernatural powers then caused all the jeweled parasols to come together and form one single parasol that spread over the entire thousand-millionfold world. All the vast features of that world were visible there in its midst. All the Mount Sumerus of the thousand-millionfold world, Snow Mountains, Muchilinda Mountains, Mahamuchilinda Mountains, Fragrant Mountains, Jeweled Mountains, Gold Mountains, Black Mountains, Iron Encircling Mountains, Great Iron Encircling Mountains, the huge seas, the rivers and watercourses, brooks and streams, fountains and springs, as well as the suns, moons, stars, constellations, heavenly palaces, dragon palaces, and the palaces of the venerable spirits-all these were to be seen within the jeweled parasol. And the Buddhas of the ten directions, the Buddhas as they preached the Law-these too were visible within the jeweled parasol.

At that time all the members of the great assembly, witnessing this manifestation of the Buddha's supernatural powers, sighed in admiration at what they had never seen before. Pressing their palms together, they made obeisance to the Buddha, gazing up in reverence at the face of the Honored One and never taking their eyes from it.

Then the rich man's son, Jeweled Accumulation, in the presence of the Buddha recited these verses of praise:

Eyes pure and broad like the blue lotus;
mind pure, steeped in meditations;
for pure deeds long accumulated, boundless in fame,
your quietude guides the assembly-thus we bow our heads.

We have seen the great sage work miraculous transformations,
showing us all the countless lands in ten directions,
the Buddhas expounding the Law therein-
every one of these we have seen and heard.

The Dharma King's Dharma powers surpass all other beings,
constantly he bestows Dharma riches on them all.
Skillfully he distinguishes the characteristics of phenomena,
never faltering in his grasp of the one great Truth.

You have learned to treat all phenomena with freedom,
so we bow our heads to this Dharma King.
You define things as neither existing nor not existing;
causes and conditions bring about their birth.

No "I," no doer, no recipient,
yet good and bad karma never cease to function.
Beneath the Buddha tree, you used your might to overpower the devil;
gaining the sweet dew of nirvana, you won your way to enlightenment.

Already free of thought, perception, and volition,
you refuted all the non-Buddhist doctrines.
Three times you turned the wheel of the Law in the thousand-millionfold world,
the wheel that from the first has always been pure.

Heavenly and human beings gained the way-this was proof of it;
the Three Treasures thereupon appeared in the world.
This wonderful Law brought rescue to the many beings;
embracing it, they never regress but dwell in constant quietude.

Great physician king, healer of old age, sickness and death,
we pay homage to the boundless virtue of your Dharma sea;
unmoved by acclamation or abuse, like Mount Sumeru,
you pity in equal measure the good and the not good.

In mind and action impartial, like the empty sky-
who can hark to this jewel of humankind, not give respectful assent?
Now we offer these little parasols to the World-Honored One,
and in them is revealed to us the three thousand worlds.

Palaces where gods, dragons, and spirits reside,
kimnaras, yakshas, and all those other beings,
everything that exists in the world we see-
the ten-powered one in pity manifests these transformations.

The assembly, seeing this rare sight, all praise the Buddha;
now we bow our heads to the venerable one of the threefold world.
Great sage, Dharma King, refuge of the multitude-
viewing the Buddha with purified mind, none who do not rejoice!

Each sees the World-Honored One standing right before him-
such are the Buddha's transcendental powers, his unshared properties.
The Buddha preaches the Law with a single voice,
but each living being understands it according to his kind.

All believe the World-Honored One speaks the same words to all-
such are his transcendental powers, his unshared properties.
The Buddha preaches the Law with a single voice,
but each living being understands it in his own way.

All undertake the Buddha's practices and gain profit thereby-
such are his transcendental powers, his unshared properties.
The Buddha preaches the Law with a single voice,
but to some it brings fear, to others delight and joy

Some are moved to leave the world, some are freed of doubt-
such are his transcendental powers, his unshared properties.
Before the great diligence of the ten-powered one we bow our heads;
we bow our heads to the fearlessness he has attained.

We bow heads before the one who dwells in unshared properties,
bow heads before the great leader of all beings.
You can cut the thongs that bind the multitude-we bow heads to that;
you crossed to the other shore-we bow heads to that.

We bow heads to one who can save all those in this world,
bow heads to one who long ago left the path of birth and death.
You know the marks of all beings in their comings and goings,
you have gained apt liberation from all phenomena.

Free of worldly attachments, like the lotus blossom,
constantly you move within the realm of emptiness and quiet;
you have mastered the marks of all phenomena, no blocks or hindrances;
like the sky, you lean on nothing-we bow our heads!
When the rich man's son, Jeweled Accumulation, had finished reciting these verses, he addressed the Buddha, saying, "World-Honored One, these five hundred sons of rich men have all set their minds on anuttara-samyak-sambodhi. They wish to hear how one can purify the Buddha lands.1 We beg the World-Honored One to explain the practices carried out by bodhisattvas in purifying the lands."

1 To "purify the Buddha lands" here means to work diligently to lead the beings of various realms or Buddha lands to enlightenment, which is one of the chief aims of the bodhisattva's activities.

The Buddha said, "Excellent, Jeweled Accumulation! For the sake of the bodhisattvas you do right to ask the Thus Come One about the practices for purifying the lands. Listen well, listen well, and mull it over in your thoughts! I will now explain to you."

Jeweled Accumulation and the other five hundred sons of rich men then made ready to listen to the teachings addressed to them.

The Buddha said, "Jeweled Accumulation, the various kinds of living beings are in themselves the Buddha lands of the bodhisattvas. Why so? Because it is by converting various beings to the teachings that the bodhisattvas acquire their Buddha lands. It is by persuading various beings and overcoming their objections that the bodhisattvas acquire their Buddha lands. It is by inducing the various living beings to enter into the Buddha wisdom in such-and-such a land that they acquire their Buddha lands. It is by inducing the various living beings to develop the capacity for bodhisattva practices in such-and-such a land that they acquire their Buddha lands.

"Why is this? Because the bodhisattva's acquisition of a pure land is wholly due to his having brought benefit to living beings. Suppose a man proposes to build a mansion on a plot of open land. He may do so as he wishes without hindrance. But if he tries to build it in the empty air, he will never be successful. It is the same with the bodhisattvas. It is because they wish to help others to achieve success that they take their vow to acquire Buddha lands. Their vow to acquire Buddha lands in not founded on emptiness.

"Jeweled Accumulation, you should understand that an upright mind is the pure land of the bodhisattva.2 When the bodhisattva attains Buddhahood, then beings who are free of flattery will be born in his country.

2 The term chih-hsin, "upright mind,"may also be translated "straightforward mind" or "direct mind. "In the paragraphs that follow, the term "pure land" is being used to mean a state of mind or course of action that allows a bodhisattva to create a Buddha land that is pure in nature by leading others to enlightenment. The quality or action in the bodhisattva produces a similar state in the beings who are born in his land; for example, because he himself is honest and upright in mind, they are free from flattery or deviousness.

"A deeply searching mind is the pure land of the bodhisattva. When he attains Buddhahood, beings who are endowed with blessings will be born in his country.

"A mind that aspires to bodhi or enlightenment is the pure land of the bodhisattva. When he attains Buddhahood, beings dedicated to the Great Vehicle will be born in his country

"Almsgiving is the pure land of the bodhisattva. When he attains Buddhahood, beings who are capable of casting away everything will be born in his country.

"Keeping of the precepts is the pure land of the bodhisattva. When he attains Buddhahood, beings who fulfill their vow to carry out the ten good actions will be born in his country.

"Forbearance. is the pure land of the bodhisattva. When he attains Buddhahood, beings who are adorned with the thirty-two features will be born in his country.

"Assiduousness is the pure land of the bodhisattva. When he attains Buddhahood, beings who strive diligently to acquire all manner of blessings will be born in his country

"Meditation is the pure land of the bodhisattva. When he attains Buddhahood, beings who can regulate their minds and keep them from disorder will be born in his country.

"Wisdom is the pure land of the bodhisattva. When he attains Buddhahood, beings who are correct and certain in understanding will be born in his country.

"A mind devoted to the four immeasurable qualities is the pure land of the bodhisattva. When he attains Buddhahood, beings perfect in the exercise of pity, compassion, joy, and indifference will be born in his country.

"The four methods of winning people are the pure land of the bodhisattva. When he attains Buddhahood, beings who are regulated by the emancipations will be born in his country.

"Expedient means are the pure land of the bodhisattva. When he attains Buddhahood, beings who can employ all manner of expedient means with complete freedom will be born in his country.

"The thirty-seven elements of the Way are the pure land of the bodhisattva. When he attains Buddhahood, beings will be born in his country who are proficient in the four states of mindfulness, the four types of correct effort, the four bases of supernatural power, the five roots of goodness, the five powers, the seven factors of enlightenment, and the eightfold holy path.

"A mind intent on transferring merit to others is the pure land of the bodhisattva. When he attains Buddhahood, he will acquire a country endowed with all manner of blessings.

"Teaching others to avoid the eight difficulties is the pure land of the bodhisattva. When he attains Buddhahood, his country will be free of the three evils and the eight difficulties.

"Observing the precepts himself but not taxing others with their shortcomings is the pure land of the bodhisattva. When he attains Buddhahood, no one in his country will be called a violater of prohibitions.

"The ten good actions are the pure land of the bodhisattva. When he attains Buddhahood, beings will be born in his country who suffer no untimely death, possess great wealth, are pure in action, sincere and truthful in word, ever mild in speech, never alienated from kin or associates, skillful in solving disputes, invariably speaking profitable words, never envious, never irate, and correct in understanding.3

3 Each of the ten merits listed here results from the observance of one of the ten good actions.

"Therefore, Jeweled Accumulation, because the bodhisattva has an upright mind, he is impelled to action. Because he is impelled to action, he gains a deeply searching mind. Because he has a deeply searching mind, his will is well controlled. Because his will is well controlled, he acts in accord with the teachings. Because he acts in accord with the teachings, he can transfer merit to others. Because he transfers merit to others, he knows how to employ expedient means. Because he knows how to employ expedient means, he can lead others to enlightenment. Because he leads others to enlightenment, his Buddha land is pure. Because his Buddha land is pure, his preaching of the Law is pure. Because his preaching of the Law is pure, his wisdom is pure. Because his wisdom is pure, his mind is pure. And because his mind is pure, all the blessings he enjoys will be pure.

"Therefore, Jeweled Accumulation, if the bodhisattva wishes to acquire a pure land, he must purify his mind. When the mind is pure, the Buddha land will be pure."

At that time Shariputra, moved by the Buddha's supernatural powers, thought to himself: "If the mind of the bodhisattva is pure, then his Buddha land will be pure. Now when our World-Honored One first determined to become a bodhisattva, surely his intentions were pure. Why then is this Buddha land so filled with impurities?" 4

4 Shariputra, one of the Buddha's ten major disciples, customarily appears in the Vimalakirti Sutra~us an expresser of doubts or expounder of erroneous views associated with Hinayana teachings. But as indicated here, the Buddha at times deliberately implants such doubts in Shariputra's mind as a means of furthering the exposition of the doctrine.

The Buddha, knowing his thoughts, said to him, "What do you think? Are the sun and moon impure? Is that why the blind man fails to see them?"

Shariputra replied, "No, World-Honored One. That is the fault of the blind man. The sun and moon are not to blame." "Shariputra, it is the failings of living beings that prevent them from seeing the marvelous purity of the land of the Buddha, the Thus Come One. The Thus Come One is not to blame. Shariputra, this land of mine is pure, but you fail to see it."

At that time one of the Brahma kings with his conchshaped tuft of hair said to Shariputra, "You must not think that this Buddha land is impure. Why do I say this? Because to my eyes, Shakyamuni's Buddha land is as pure and spotless as the palace of the heavenly being Great Freedom."

Shariputra said, "When I look at this land, I see it full of knolls and hollows, thorny underbrush, sand and gravel, dirt, rocks, many mountains, filth and defilement."

The Brahma king said, "It is just that your mind has highs and lows and does not rest on Buddha wisdom. Therefore you see this land as impure. Shariputra, the bodhisattva treats all things and beings, each one of them, with perfect equality. His deeply searching mind is pure, and because it rests on Buddha wisdom, it can see the purity of this Buddha land."

The Buddha then pressed his toe against the earth, and immediately the thousand-millionfold world was adorned with hundreds and thousands of rare jewels, till it resembled Jeweled Adornment Buddha's Jeweled Adornment Land of Immeasurible Blessings. All the members of the great assembly sighed in wonder at what they had never seen before, and all saw that hey themselves were seated on jeweled lotuses. 5

5 That is, they perceived that they themselves were possessed of the Buddha nature.

The Buddha said to Shariputra, "Now do you see the marwelous purity of this Buddha land?"

Shariputra replied, "Indeed I do, World-Honored One. Somehing I have never seen before, and never even heard of-now all he marvelous purity of the Buddha land is visible before me!"

The Buddha said to Shariputra, "My Buddha land has always been pure like this. But because I wish to save those persons who are lowly and inferior, I make it seem an impure land full of defilements, that is all. It is like the case of heavenly beings. All ate their food from the same precious vessel, but the food looks different for each one, depending upon the merits and virtues hat each possesses. It is the same in this case, Shariputra. If a person's mind is pure, then he will see the wonderful blessings that adorn this land."

When the Buddha in this way revealed the marvelous purity of the land, the five hundred sons of rich men who accompanied Jeweled Accumulation all were able to grasp the truth of birthlessness, and eighty-four thousand persons all set their minds on attaining anuttara-samyak-sambodhi. The Buddha then released the supernatural power that he had exercised with his toe and the world returned to its former appearance.

Thirty-two thousand heavenly and human beings who wished to pursue the path of the voice-hearer, understanding that all things are impermanent in nature, cast off the dust, removed themselves from defilement, and attained the pure Dharma eye; and eight thousand monks, ceasing to accept the phenomenal world, put an end to all outflows and gained emancipation of mind.

Chapter 2
EXPEDIENT MEANS
At that time in the great city of Vaishali there was a rich man named Vimalakirti. Already in the past he had offered alms to immeasurable numbers of Buddhas, had deeply planted the roots of goodness, and had grasped the truth of birthlessness. Unhindered in his eloquence, able to disport himself with transcendental powers, he commanded full retention of the teachings and had attained the state of fearlessness. He had overcome the torments and ill will of the devil and entered deeply into the doctrine of the Law, proficient in the paramita of wisdom and a master in the employing of expedient means. He had successfully fulfilled his great vow and could clearly discern how the minds of others were tending. Moreover, he could distinguish whether their capacities were keen or obtuse. His mind was cleansed and purified through long practice of the Buddha Way, firm in its grasp of the Great Vehicle, and all his actions were well thought out and planned. He maintained the dignity and authority of a Buddha, and his mind was vast as the sea. All the Buddhas sighed with admiration, and he commanded the respect of the disciplies, of Indra, Brahma, and the Four Heavenly Kings.

Desiring to save others, he employed the excellent expedient of residing in Vaishali. His immeasurable riches he used to relieve the poor, his faultless observation of the precepts served as a reproach to those who would violate prohibitions. Through his restraint and forbearance he warned others against rage and anger, and his great assiduousness discouraged all thought of sloth and indolence. Concentrating his single mind in quiet meditation, he suppressed disordered thoughts; through firm and unwavering wisdom he overcame all that was not wise. l

1 This paragraph describes Vimalakirti's practice of the six paramitas, for which see glossary.

Though dressed in the white robes of a layman, he observed all the rules of pure conduct laid down for monks, and though he lived at home, he felt no attachment to the threefold world. One could see he had a wife and children, yet he was at all times chaste in action; obviously he had kin and household attendants, yet he always delighted in withdrawing from them. Although he wore jewels and finery, his real adornment was the auspicious marks; although he ate and drank like others, what he truly savored was the joy of meditation.

If he visited the gambling parlors, it was solely to bring enlightenment to those there; if he listened to the doctrines of other religions, he did not allow them to impinge on the true faith. Though well versed in secular writings, his constant delight was in the Buddhist Law. Respected by everyone, he was looked on as foremost among those deserving of alms; embracing and upholding the correct Dharma, he gave guidance to old and young. In a spirit of trust and harmony he conducted all kinds of business enterprises, but though he reaped worldly profits, he took no delight in these.

He frequented the busy crossroads in order to bring benefit to others, entered the government offices and courts of law so as to aid and rescue all those he could. He visited the places of debate in order to guide others to the Great Vehicle, visited the schools and study halls to further the instruction of the pupils. He entered houses of ill fame to teach the folly of fleshly desire, entered wine shops in order to encourage those with a will to quit them.

If he was among rich men, they honored him as foremost among them because he preached the superior Law for them. If he was among lay believers, they honored him as foremost because he freed them from greed and attachment. Among Kshatriyas he was most highly honored because he taught them forbearance. Among Brahmans he was most highly honored because he rid them of their self-conceit. The great ministers honored him as foremost because he taught the correct Law. The princes honored him as foremost because he showed them how to be loyal and filial. Within the women's quarters he was most honored because he converted and brought refinement to the women of the harem.

The common people honored him as first among them because he helped them to gain wealth and power. The Brahma deities honored him as first among them because he revealed the superiority of wisdom. The Indras honored him as first among them because he demonstrated the truth of impermanence. The Four Heavenly Kings, guardians of the world, honored him as foremost because he guarded all living beings.

In this way the rich man Vimalakirti employed immeasurable numbers of expedient means in order to bring benefit to others. Using these expedient means, he made it appear that his body had fallen prey to illness. Because of his illness, the king of the country, the great ministers, rich men, lay believers, and Brahmans, as well as the princes and lesser officials, numbering countless thousands, all went to see him and inquire about his illness.

Vimalakirti then used this bodily illness to expound the Law to them in broad terms: "Good people, this body is impermanent, without durability, without strength, without firmness, a thing that decays in a moment, not to be relied on. It suffers, it is tormented, a meeting place of manifold ills.

"Good people, no person of enlightened wisdom could depend on a thing like this body This body is like a cluster of foam, nothing you can grasp or handle. This body is like a bubble that cannot continue for long. This body is like a flame born of longing and desire. This body is like the plantain that has no firmness in its trunk. This body is like a phantom, the product of error and confusion. This body is like a dream, compounded of false and empty visions. This body is like a shadow, appearing through karma causes. This body is like an echo, tied to causes and conditions. This body is like a drifting cloud, changing and vanishing in an instant. This body is like lightning, barely lasting from moment to moment.

"This body is like earth that has no subjective being. This body is like fire, devoid of ego. This body is like wind that has no set life span. This body is like water, devoid of individuality.

"This body has no reality but makes these four elements its lodging. This body is void, removed from self and self's possessions. This body is without understanding, like plants or trees, tiles or pebbles. This body is without positive action, blown about by the wind. This body is impure, crammed with defilement and evil. This body is empty and unreal; though for a time you may bathe and cleanse, clothe and feed it, in the end it must crumble and fade. This body is plague-ridden, beset by a hundred and one ills and anxieties. This body is like the abandoned well on the hillside, old age pressing in on it. This body has no fixity, but is destined for certain death. This body is like poisonous snakes, vengeful bandits, or an empty village, a mere coming together of components, realms, and sense-fields.

"Good people, a thing like, this is irksome and hateful, and therefore you should seek the Buddha body. Why? Because the Buddha body is the Dharma body. It is born from immeasurable merits and wisdom. It is born from precepts, meditation, wisdom, emancipation, and the insight of emancipation. It is born from pity, compassion, joy, and indifference. It is born of the various paramitas such as almsgiving, keeping of the precepts, forbearance and gentleness, assiduousness in religious practice, meditation, emancipation and samadhi, wide knowledge and wisdom. It is born of expedient means, born of the six transcendental powers, born of the three understandings, born of the thirty-seven elements of the Way, born of concentration and insight, born of the ten powers, the four kinds of fearlessness, and the eighteen unshared properties. It is born of the cutting off of all things not good and the gathering in of all good things, born of the truth, born of the avoidance of indulgence and laxity. The body of the Thus Come One is born of immeasurable numbers of pure and spotless things such as these.

"Good people, if you wish to gain the Buddha body and do away with the ills that afflict all living beings, then you must set your minds on attaining anuttara-samyak-sambodhi."

In this manner the rich man Vimalakirti used the occasion to preach the Law to those who came to inquire about his illness. As a result, numberless thousands of persons were all moved to set their minds on the attainment of anuttara-samyak-sambodhi.

Chapter 3
THE DISCIPLES
At that time the rich man Vimalakirti thought to himself: "I am lying here sick in bed. Why does the World-Honored One in his great compassion fail to show some concern for me?"

The Buddha, aware of this thought, said to Shariputra, "You must go visit Vimalakirti and inquire about his illness."

But Shariputra replied to the Buddha in these words: "World-Honored One, I am not competent to visit him and inquire about his illness. Why? Because I recall one occasion in the past when I was sitting in quiet meditation under a tree in the forest.

"At that time Vimalakirti approached and said to me, 'Ah, Shariputra, you should not assume that this sort of sitting is true quiet sitting! Quiet sitting means that in this threefold world you manifest neither body nor will. This is quiet sitting. Not rising out of your samadhi of complete cessation and yet showing yourself in the ceremonies of daily life-this is quiet sitting. Not abandoning the principles of the Way and yet showing yourself in the activities of a common mortal-this is quiet sitting. Your mind not fixed on internal things and yet not engaged with externals either-this is quiet sitting. Unmoved by sundry theories, but practicing the thirty-seven elements of the Way-this is quiet sitting. Entering nirvana without having put an end to earthly desires-this is quiet sitting. If you can do this kind of sitting, you will merit the Buddha's seal of approval.'

"At that time, World-Honored One, when I heard him speak these words, I remained silent, for I had no way to reply to them. That is why I am not competent to visit him and inquire about his illness."

The Buddha then said to Maudgalyayana, "You must go visit Vimalakirti and inquire about his illness."

But Maudgalyayana replied to the Buddha: "World-Honored One, I am not competent to visit him and inquire about his illness. Why? Because I recall how in the past I entered the great city of Vaishali and in its streets and lanes expounded the Dharma for the lay believers.

"At that time Vimalakirti approached and said to me, 'Ah, Maudgalyayana, when you expound the Dharma for the white-robed lay believers, you should not expound it the way you are doing! Expounding the Dharma should be done in accordance with the Dharma [reality] itself.

"'The Dharma knows nothing of living beings, because it is removed from the defilement of such concepts as "living beings." The Dharma knows nothing of "I," because it is removed from the defilement of such concepts as "I." It knows nothing of a life span, because it knows nothing of birth and death. It knows nothing of individuality, because it is cut off from considerations of past or future lives. The Dharma is forever still and serene, because it has wiped out all characteristics. The Dharma is without characteristics, because it is without anything that can be perceived. The Dharma is without names or appellations, because it is cut off from all language. The Dharma is without any expounding, because it is removed from broad or minute contemplation by the mind. The Dharma is without forms or characteristics, because it is as though vacant and empty. The Dharma is not the subject of frivolous theories, because in the end it is empty. The Dharma is without the concept of "mine," because it is removed from all such concepts of personal possession. The Dharma is without distinctions, because it is apart from all types of consciousness. The Dharma has nothing it can compare to, because there is no entity that can be set beside it.

"'The Dharma is not affected by causes, because it does not exist in a conditioned realm. The Dharma is identical with the Dharma-nature, because it enters into all phenomena [dharmas]. The Dharma conforms with what is truly so, because there is nothing else to conform to. The Dharma abides in the locus of reality, being unaffected by anything on the periphery. The Dharma is without motion or wavering, never depending on the six sense objects. The Dharma is without coming or going, since it never abides anywhere to begin with.

"'The Dharma accords with emptiness, follows what is formless, responds to what is actionless. The Dharma is separate from beautiful or ugly. The Dharma knows no increase or diminution, the Dharma knows no birth or extinction, the Dharma knows no destination. The Dharma transcends eyes, ears, nose, tongue, body, and mind. The Dharma knows no high or low. The Dharma constantly abides without moving. The Dharma is separate from all meditational practices.

"'Ah, Maudgalyayana, since the characteristics of the Dharma are such as these, how can one expound it? Expounding the Dharma means no expounding, no demonstrating, and listening to the Dharma means no listening, no grasping. It is like a conjurer of phantoms expounding the Dharma for phantom persons. It is with this understanding that you should expound the Dharma.

"'You should take into account that some living beings are keen in capacity while others are dull, cultivate the kind of skilled insight that is free from all impediment, with a mind steeped in great compassion praise the Great Vehicle, and remember the debt of gratitude you owe the Buddha, never allowing the Three Treasures to come to an end. When you have done all this, then you may expound the Dharma.'

"When Vimalakirti expounded the Dharma in this way, eight hundred lay believers set their minds on the attainment of anuttara-samyak-sambodhi. I possess no such eloquence as this. Therefore I say that I am not competent to visit him and inquire about his illness."

The Buddha then said to Mahakashyapa, "You must go visit Vimalakirti and inquire about his illness."

But Mahakashyapa replied to the Buddha: "World-Honored One, I am not competent to visit him and inquire about his illness. Why? Because I recall how in the past I was begging for alms in a poor village.

"At that time Vimalakirti approached and said to me, 'Ah, Mahakashyapa, you have a mind marked by compassion and pity, but you do not know how to apply it to all alike. Instead you shun the rich and mighty and beg alms among the poor.

"'Mahakashyapa, you must abide by the principle of equanimity and in that spirit go about begging for food. Because in the end there is no such thing as eating, in that spirit one goes about begging for food. Because one wishes to destroy dependence on things characterized by a mere combination of elements, in that spirit one accepts these balls of foodstuff. Because in the end there is no receiving, in that spirit one receives this food.

"'When you enter a village, think of it as an empty village. The forms you see there should appear as they would to a blind man, the sounds you hear should be mere echoes. The aromas you inhale should be so much thin air, the flavors you taste should be undifferentiated.

"'Accept all sensations in accordance with the enlightenment of wisdom, and understand that all phenomena are no more than phantom forms. They have no intrinsic nature, nor do they take on any other nature. l

1 Or, according to another interpretation: "Intrinsically they have never been on fire, and hence will never burn out. "The character jan can mean either "so," or "thus," or "to burn."

"'Mahakashyapa, if, without casting aside the eight errors, you can enter into the eight emancipations; if, while possessing the marks of error, you can enter the correct Law; if with one meal you can feed all beings, offering alms to the Buddhas and the sages and worthy persons, then after that you may eat your food.

"'One who eats in this manner neither possesses earthly desires nor is separated from earthly desires, neither enters into a meditative state of mind nor arises out of such a state, neither dwells in this world nor dwells in nirvana.

"'One who gives alms in this manner derives neither great fortune nor little fortune, neither profit nor loss. This is the correct way to enter the Buddha way without relying on the path of the voice-hearer.

"'Mahakashyapa, if you can eat your food in this manner, then you will not be eating in vain the food that others give you.' "At that time, World-Honored One, when I heard him speak these words, I gained what I had never had before, and I was inspired with a profound respect for all the bodhisattvas. And I thought to myself, 'If this householder possesses such eloquence and wisdom that he can speak like this, then who could listen to him without being moved to set his mind on the attainment of anuttara-samyak-sambodhi?' From that time on I ceased to urge others to follow the path of the voice-hearer or the pratyekabuddha. That is why I say I am not competent to visit him and inquire about his illness."

The Buddha then said to Subhuti, "You must go visit Vimalakirti and inquire about his illness."

But Subhuti replied to the Buddha: "World-Honored One, I am not competent to visit him and ask about his illness. Why? Because I recall how in the past I went to his house to beg alms.

"At that time Vimalakirti took my begging bowl, filled it with things, to eat, and said, 'Ah, Subhuti, if one can look on all foods as equal, that person can look on all things as equal, and if one looks on all things as equal, one will look on all foods as equal. If one begs alms in this manner, then one is worthy to receive food.

"'Subhuti, if you can not cut yourself off from lewdness, anger, and stupidity and yet not be a part of these; if you can refrain from destroying the idea of a self and yet see all things as of a single nature; if without wiping out stupidity and attachment you can find your way to understanding and freedom from attachment; if you can seem to be a perpetrator of the five cardinal sins and yet gain emancipation; if you can be neither unbound nor bound, neither one who has perceived the four noble truths nor one who has not perceived them, neither one who obtains the fruits of religious practice nor one who does not obtain them, neither a common mortal nor one who has removed himself from the ways of the common mortal, neither a sage nor not a sage-if in this manner you can master all phenomenal things and yet remove yourself from the ways that mark them, then you will be worthy to receive food.

"'Subhuti, if without seeing the Buddha or listening to his Law you are willing to take those six heretical teachers, Purana Kashyapa, Maskarin Goshaliputra, Samjayin Vairatiputra, Ajita Keshakambala, Kakuda Katyayana, and Nirgrantha Jnatiputra, as your teachers, leave the household life because of them, and follow them in falling into the same errors they fall into, then you will be worthy to receive food.

"'Subhuti, if you can subscribe to erroneous views and thus never reach the "other shore" of enlightenment; if you can remain among the eight difficulties and never escape from difficulty, and can make common cause with earthly desires and remove yourself from a state of purity; if when you attain the samadhi of nondisputation you allow all living beings to attain the same degree of concentration; if those who give you alms are not destined to gain good fortune thereby, and those who make offerings to you fall into the three evil paths of existence; if you are willing to join hands with the host of devils and make the defilements your companion; if you can be no different from all these devils and these dusts and defilements; if you can bear hatred toward all living beings, slander the Buddhas, vilify the Law, not be counted among the assembly of monks, and in the end never attain nirvana-if you can do all this, then you will be worthy to receive food.'

"At that time, World-Honored One, when I heard these words, I was dumbfounded, not knowing what sort of words they were or how to answer them. I put down my alms bowl, intending to leave the house, but Vimalakirti said to me, 'Ah, Subhuti, pick up your alms bowl and do not be afraid. Why do I say this? If some phantom person conjured up by the Thus Come One were to reprimand you as I have just done, you would not be afraid, would you?'

"'No,' I replied.

"Vimalakirti said, 'All things in the phenomenal world are just such phantoms and conjured beings. So you have no cause to feel afraid. Why? Because all words and pronouncements too are no different from these other phantom forms. When a person is wise, he does not cling to words and hence is not afraid of them. Why? Because words are something apart from self-nature-words do not really exist. And this is emancipation. All things of the phenomenal world bear this mark of emancipation.'

"When Vimalakirti expounded the Law in this manner, two hundred heavenly beings gained the purity of the Dharma eye. Therefore I say I am not competent to visit him and ask about his illness."

The Buddha then said to Purna Maitrayaniputra, "You must go visit Vimalakirti and ask about his illness."

But Purna said to the Buddha, "World-Honored One, I am not competent to visit him and ask about his illness. Why? Because I recall how once, under a tree in the great forest, I was expounding the Law to some monks who had just begun their study of the Way.

"At that time Vimalakirti approached and said to me, 'Ah, Purna, you should first enter into meditation and observe a person's mind before expounding the Law to that person. One does not put rotten food in a precious vessel. You must determine what thoughts are in the minds of these monks. Do not treat precious lapis lazuli as though it were mere glass!

"'You seem unable to understand the basic capacities of living beings. You must not try to rouse their aspirations by preaching the doctrines of the Lesser Vehicle. Do not inflict injury on those who are without wounds! If you want them to travel the great highway, do not show them a little bypath. Do not try to fit the vast ocean into an ox's hoofprint, do not regard the light of the sun as if it were a firefly's glimmer!

"'Purna, these monks long ago set their minds on the Great Vehicle, but later they forgot their original intentions. Why do you use the doctrines of the Lesser Vehicle to teach and guide them? As I see it, the wisdom of the Lesser Vehicle is trite and shallow, like the understanding of a blind person. It is incapable of discerning whether the capacities of living beings are keen or dull.'

"At that time Vimalakirti entered into samadhi, making it possible for these monks to become aware of their former existences. In the past, under five hundred Buddhas, they had planted the roots of virtue and set their minds on the attainment of anuttara-samyak-sambodhi. And at that moment they were suddenly able to regain their original spirit of resolve. With that, the monks bowed their heads at Vimalakirti's feet. Then he preached the Law for them, insuring that they would never again regress in their striving for anuttara-samyak-sambodhi. And I thought to myself that a voice-hearer should never preach the Law when he cannot discern people's inner capacities. Therefore I say I am not competent to visit Vimalakirti and inquire about his illness."

The Buddha then said to Mahakatyayana, "You must go visit Vimalakirti and ask about his illness."

But Mahakatyayana said to the Buddha, "World-Honored One, I am not competent to visit him and ask about his illness. Why? Because I recall how in the past the Buddha was once summing up for the monks the essential points in his preaching of the Law Later, I expounded and elaborated on what he had said, discussing the meaning of the terms impermanence, suffering, emptiness, non-ego, and tranquil extinction or nirvana.

"At that time Vimalakirti approached and said to me, 'Ah, Mahakatyayana, you must not try to expound on the true nature of phenomena when your mind is concerned with distinctions such as birth or extinction. For in the end all phenomeria know neither birth nor extinction-this is the meaning of impermanence. The five components are wide open, empty, nothing arising in them-this is the meaning of suffering. The various phenomena ultimately have no existence-this is the meaning of emptiness. Ego and non-ego are not two different things-this is the meaning of non-ego. Phenomena have never been "so" to begin with, and hence will never cease to be "so"2-this is the meaning of tranquil extinction.'

2 Or, according to another interpretation: "Things have never been on fire to begin with, so they cannot go out now." See note 1 in this chapter.

"When he expounded the Law in this way, the minds of the monks were able to gain emancipation. That is why I say I am not competent to visit Vimalakirti and ask about his illness."

The Buddha then said to Aniruddha, "You must go visit Vimalakirti and ask about his illness."

But Aniruddha said to the Buddha, "World-Honored One, I am not competent to visit him and ask about his illness. Why? Because I recall how once I was walking around to stretch my legs when a Brahma king named Austere Purity, accompanied by ten thousand Brahmas, all emitting beams of pure light, came to the place where I was. Bowing his head in obeisance, he questioned me, saying, 'Aniruddha, how far can this divine eye of yours see?'3

3 Aniruddha was known among the ten major disciples as foremost in divine sight.

"I replied, 'Sir, I can see this whole thousand-millionfold world, the Buddha land of Shakyamuni, as though I were peering down at a myrobalan fruit in the palm of my hand.'

"At that time Vimalakirti approached and said to me, 'Ah, Aniruddha, this sight possessed by the divine eye-is it conditioned in nature, or is it unconditioned? If it is conditioned in nature, then it is the same as the five transcendental powers of the non-Buddhist teachers. And if it is unconditioned, then it is uncreated, and hence is incapable of seeing anything.'

"At that time I remained silent. But the Brahmas, hearing his words, gained what they had never had before. At once they made obeisance to him and said, 'In this world, who possesses the true divine eye?'

"Vimalakirti replied, 'Only the Buddha, the World-Honored One, is able to acquire the true divine eye. He is constantly in a state of samadhi and can see all the Buddha lands, because he does not see in terms of duality.'

"Thereupon the Brahma king Austere Purity and his retinue of five hundred Brahma deities all set their minds on the attainment of anuttara-samyak-sambodhi. They bowed at Vimalakirti's feet and then suddenly were seen no more. Therefore I say I am not competent to visit Vimalakirti and ask about his illness.'

The Buddha then said to Upali, "You must go visit Vimalakirti and ask about his illness."

But Upali replied to the Buddha, "World-Honored One, I am not competent to visit him and ask about his illness. Why? Because I recall once in the past when two monks had violated the rules of conduct and were feeling ashamed of themselves but did not dare ask the Buddha what to do. So they came to me and said, 'Ah, Upali, we have violated the precepts and are truly ashamed, but we do not dare ask the Buddha what to do. Please free us from our doubts and remorse and tell us how we can be excused from blame.'4

4 Upali was known as foremost in observing the precepts.

"I explained to them how one goes about gaining pardon according to the Law But at that time Vimalakirti approached and said to me, 'Ah, Upali, do not make the offense these monks have committed even worse than it is ! You should go about wiping out their doubts and remorse at once and not trouble their minds further!

"'Why do I say this? Because their offense by its nature does not exist either inside them, or outside, or in between. As the Buddha has taught us, when the mind is defiled, the living being will be defiled. When the mind is pure, the living being will be pure. As the mind is, so will be the offense or defilement. The same is true of all things, for none escape the realm of Suchness.

"'Now, Upali, if one gains emancipation from delusion through an understanding of the nature of the mind, does any defilement remain?'

"'No,' I replied.

"Vimalakirti said, 'In the same way, when all living beings gain an understanding of the nature of the mind, then no defilement exists. Ah, Upali, deluded thoughts are defilement. Where there are no deluded thoughts, that is purity. Topsy-turvy thinking is defilement. Where there is no topsy-turvy thinking, that is purity. Belief in the self is defilement. Where there is no such belief, that is purity.

"'Upali, all phenomena are born and pass into extinction, never enduring, like phantoms, like lightning. They do not wait for one another or linger for an instant. All phenomena are the product of deluded vision, like dreams, like flames, like the moon in the water or an image in a mirror, born of deluded thoughts. One who understands this is called a keeper of the precepts, one who understands this is called well liberated.'

"At this, the two monks exclaimed, `Superlative wisdom! Upali could never match this; he who is "foremost in observing the precepts" could never speak like this!' And I added, 'Leaving the Thus Come One aside, no voice-hearer or bodhisattva has ever commanded such eloquence in apt exposition. See how clear and penetrating his wisdom is!'

"At that time the doubts and remorse of the two monks were wiped away and they set their minds on the attainment of anut-tara-samyak-sambodhi, vowing that 'We will enable all living beings to gain eloquence such as this!' Therefore I say I am not competent to visit Vimalakirti and ask about his illness."

The Buddha then said to Rahula, "You must go visit Vimalakirti and ask about his illness."

But Rahula said to the Buddha, "World-Honored One, I am not competent to visit him and ask about his illness. Why? Because I recall how once in the past the sons of the wealthy men of Vaishali came to the place where I was, bowed their heads in obeisance, and questioned me. 'Ah, Rahula,' they said, 'you are the Buddha's son, but you cast aside your claim to the rank of a wheel-turning king and left the household life to become a monk. What benefits does one acquire by leaving the household life?'

"I explained to them the benefits and blessings one gains by leaving the household life as the Law describes them. But at that time Vimalakirti approached and said to me, 'Ah, Rahula, you should not speak of the benefits and blessings gained by leaving the household life. Why? Because to be without benefits and without blessings is to leave household life.

"'In the case of things that are conditioned in nature one may speak of them as having benefits and blessings. But one who leaves household life enters the realm of the unconditioned, and in the realm of the unconditioned there are no benefits, no blessings.

"'Rahula, leaving the household life is not that, not this, and not in between. It means abandoning the sixty-two erroneous views to reside in nirvana; it is accepted by the wise and carried out by the sages. It means conquering and subduing the host of devils, moving beyond the five realms of existence, purifying the five eyes, acquiring the five powers, and cultivating the five roots of goodness. It means not troubling others but removing oneself from sundry evils, refuting the non-Buddhist doctrines, transcending the realm of makeshift names, shaking off mud and defilement. It is without ties or attachments, without personal possessions, without thought of possessions, without fluster or confusion. It means harboring joy within, guarding the minds of others, pursuing the practice of meditation, and freeing oneself from all fault. If one can do all this, then one has truly left the household.'

"Then Vimalakirti addressed the rich men's sons, saying, 'Now that you are in the midst of the correct Law, you should all join in leaving the household life. Why? Because it is rare to happen on a time when the Buddha is in the world!'

"But the rich men's sons said, 'Layman, we have heard the Buddha say that one must not leave the household life without the permission of one's parents.'

"'In that case, you should set your minds on attaining anuttara-samyak-sambodhi,' said Vimalakirti. 'That is the same as leaving the household, the same as taking monastic vows.'

"At that time thirty-two rich men's sons all set their minds on attaining anuttara-samyak-sambodhi. Therefore I say I am not competent to visit Vimalakirti and ask about his illness."

The Buddha then said to Ananda, "You must go visit Vimalakirti and ask about his illness."

But Ananda said to the Buddha, "World-Honored One, I am not competent to visit him and ask about his illness. Why? Because I recall once in the past when the World-Honored One was feeling somewhat ill and needed some cow's milk. I at once took my begging bowl, went to the home of one of the great Brahmans, and stood by the gate. At that time Vimalakirti approached and said to me, 'Ah, Ananda, what are you doing standing here early in the morning with your begging bowl?'

"I replied, 'Layman, the World-Honored One is suffering from a slight bodily illness and needs some cow's milk. That's why I've come here.'

"But Vimalakirti said, 'Hush, hush, Ananda! Never speak such words! The body of the Thus Come One is diamond-hard in substance. All evils have been cut away, manifold good things gather there. How could it know illness, how could it know distress? Go your way in silence, Ananda, and do not defame the Thus Come One. Don't let others hear you speaking such coarse words! Don't let these heavenly beings of great majesty and virtue and these bodhisattvas who have come from the pure lands of other regions hear such utterances!

"'Ananda, even a wheel-turning sage king with his few blessings is still able to exempt himself from illness. How much more so, then, the Thus Come One, in whom immeasurable blessings meet, the surpasser of all! Be on your way, Ananda, and do not inflict this shame on us.

"'If the non-Buddhists and Brahmans should hear such talk they would think to themselves: "Why call this man Teacher? He cannot save himself from illness, so how could he save others from their illnesses?" Slip away quickly now so no one will hear what you have said!

"'Ananda, you should know that the body of the Thus Come One is the Dharma body, not the body of the world of thought and desires. The Buddha is the World-Honored One who transcends the threefold world. The Buddha body is free of out-flows, for all its outflows have been cut off. The Buddha body is unconditioned and does not fall within the realm of destinies. A body such as this-how could it know illness, how could it know distress?'

"At that time, World-Honored One, I felt truly ashamed and thought, I must go to the Buddha and ask if I heard him incorrectly. But at that moment I heard a voice in the sky saying, 'Ananda, it is as the layman has said. But the Buddha has appeared in this evil world of five impurities and at present is practicing the Law so as to save and liberate living beings. Go, Ananda, get the milk and do not feel ashamed!'

"But, World-Honored One, Vimalakirti commands such wisdom and eloquence as this! That is why I say I am not competent to visit him and ask about his illness."

Thus all five hundred of the major disciples one by one described to the Buddha some earlier experience and the words that Vimalakirti had spoken on that occasion, each declaring, "I am not competent to visit him and ask about his illness."

Chapter 4
THE BODHISATTVAS
The Buddha then said to the bodhisattva Maitreya, "You must go visit Vimalakirti and inquire about his illness."

But Maitreya replied to the Buddha: "World-Honored One, I am not competent to visit him and inquire about his illness. Why? Because I recall how once in the past I was preaching to the king of the Tushita heaven and his followers on the practices required to attain the state of nonregression.

"At that time Vimalakirti approached and said to me, 'Maitreya, the World-Honored One prophesied that with one more birth you will be able to attain anuttara-samyak-sambodhi. Now just what birth does this prophecy apply to? Does it apply to your past birth, your future birth, or your present birth?

"'If it applies to a past birth, that past birth has already passed into extinction. If it applies to a future birth, that future birth has yet to arrive. And if it applies to a present birth, this present birth lacks permanence. For, as the Buddha has said, "Monks, one moment you are born, the next you grow old, the next you pass into extinction.'

"'Or does the prophecy apply to the state of birthlessness? But birthlessness is none other than the state of Correct Realization, and the stage of Correct Realization can have nothing to do with prophecies of enlightenment or with the attainment of anuttara-samyak-sambodhi. So how, Maitreya, can you be given this prophecy about "one birth"?

"'Were you given this prophecy because of some birth that pertains to Suchness? Or were you given this prophecy because of some extinction that pertains to Suchness? If you were given this prophecy because of some birth that pertains to Suchness, you should know that in Suchness there is no birth. And if you were given this prophecy because of some extinction that pertains to Suchness, you should know that in Suchness there is no extinction.

"'All living beings are a part of Suchness, and all other things as well are a part of Suchness. The sages and worthy ones too are a part of Suchness; even you, Maitreya, are a part of Suchness. So if you have been given a prophecy of enlightenment, then all living beings should likewise be given such a prophecy. Why? Because Suchness knows no dualism or differentiation. If you, Maitreya, are able to attain anuttara-samyak-sambodhi, then all living beings should likewise be able to attain it. Why? Because all living beings in truth bear the marks of bodhi. If you, Maitreya, are able to gain nirvana, then all living beings should likewise be able to gain it. Why? Because the Buddhas know that all living beings bear the marks of tranquil extinction, which is nirvana, and that there is no further extinction. Therefore, Maitreya, you must not use doctrines such as this to mislead these offspring of the gods. For in truth there is no such thing as setting one's mind on the attainment of anuttara-samyak-sambodhi or of attaining the state of nonregression.

"'Maitreya, you should persuade these offspring of the gods to abandon any view that makes distinctions concerning bodhi. Why? Because bodhi is not something that can be acquired by the body, or acquired by the mind.

"'Tranquil extinction is bodhi, for in it all marks become extinct. Noncontemplation is bodhi, for it is divorced from all causes. Nonaction is bodhi, for it is devoid of thought and mental activity Cutting off is bodhi, for it abandons all views. Removal is bodhi, for it means the removal of all deluded thoughts.

"'Blocking is bodhi, because it blocks out all aspiration. Non-involvement is bodhi, because it is without greed or attachment. Compliance is bodhi, because it complies with Suchness. Abiding is bodhi, because it abides in the Dharma-nature.

"'Extending is bodhi, for it extends to the limit of reality. Nonduality is bodhi, for it is removed from thoughts and thought objects. Equality is bodhi, for in it all is equally empty and void. The unconditioned is bodhi, for it knows no birth, abiding, or extinction. Understanding is bodhi, for it fully comprehends the mental activities of living beings.

"Nonengagement is bodhi, because it enters into no kind of engagement with objects. Nonparticipation is bodhi, because it has freed itself from the habits of earthly desire. The dwellingless is bodhi, because it lacks shape or form. The provisionally named is bodhi, because names and words are void.

"'Phantomlike is bodhi, for it neither grasps nor lets go. Untroubled is bodhi, for it is forever still of itself. Good tranquillityl is bodhi, for it is pure in nature. Ungrasping is bodhi; for it is removed from distracting causes. Nondifferentiation is bodhi, for in it all phenomena are equal. Incomparable is bodhi, for no simile can convey it. Subtle and wonderful is bodhi, for phenomena are hard to understand.'

"World-Honored One, when Vimalakirti expounded the Law in this fashion, two hundred offspring of the gods were able to grasp the truth of birthlessness. Therefore I say I am not competent to visit him and ask about his illness."

The Buddha then said to the bodhisattva Shining Adornment, a young boy, "You must go visit Vimalakirti and ask about his illness."

But Shining Adornment replied to the Buddha: "World-Honored One, I am not competent to visit him and inquire about his illness. Why? Because I remember once in the past when I was leaving the great city of Vaishali. Vimalakirti was just then entering the city, and I accordingly bowed to him and said, 'Layman, where are you coming from?'

"He replied, 'I am coming from the place of practice.'

1 Some texts read "The tranquillity of meditation."

"'The place of practice-where is that?' I asked.

"He replied, 'An upright mind is the place of practice, for it is without sham or falsehood. The resolve to act is the place of practice, for it can judge matters properly. A deeply searching mind is the place of practice, for it multiplies benefits. The mind that aspires to bodhi is the place of practice, for it is without error or misconception.

"'Almsgiving is the place of practice, because it hopes for no reward. Observance of the precepts is the place of practice, because it brings fulfillment of vows. Forbearance is the place of practice, because it enabJes one to view all living beings with a mind free of obstruction. Assiduousness is the place of practice, because it forestalls laziness and regression. Meditation is the place of practice, because it makes the mind tame and gentle. Wisdom is the place of practice, because it sees all things as they are.

"'Pity is the place of practice, for it views all living beings equally. Compassion is the pJace of practice, for it bears up under weariness and pain. Joy is the place of practice, for it revels in Dharma delight. Indifference is the place of practice, for it rejects both hatred and love.

"'Transcendental powers are the place of practice, because thereby one masters the six powers. Emancipation is the place of practice, because it knows how to renounce and set aside. Expedient means are the place of practice, because they can teach and convert living beings. The four methods of winning people are the place of practice, because they can win living beings over. Much learning is the place of practice, because one carries out what one has learned. A disciplined mind is the place of practice, because one can thereby contempJate all phenomena correctly The thirty-seven elements of the Way are the place of practice, because through them, one rejects what is conditioned. Truth2 is the place of practice, because it does not deceive the world.

2 Some texts read "The four noble truths."

"'Causes and conditions are the place of practice, for none of the links in the chain of causation, from ignorance to old age and death, ever come to an end. Earthly desires are the place of practice, for through them we know the nature of Suchness. Living beings are the place of practice, for through them we know that there is no ego. All phenomena are the place of practice, for through them we know the emptiness of all phenomena.

"'Conquering devils is the place of practice, because one is unswayed, unflinching. The threefold world is the place of practice, because there is no path for one there. The lion's roar is the place of practice, because it has nothing it fears. The ten powers, the four kinds of fearlessness, the eighteen unshared properties are the place of practice, because they are free of all fault. The three understandings are the place of practice, because they are without the least obstruction. Understanding all phenomena in one instant of thought is the place of practice, because one thereby becomes master of all wisdom.

"'My good fellow, if bodhisattvas apply themselves to the paramitas and teach and convert living beings, then you should understand that everything they do, every lifting of a foot, every placing of a foot, will in effect be a "coming from the place of practice," an abiding in the Buddha's Law.'

"When Vimalakirti preached the Law in this manner, five hundred heavenly and human beings all set their minds on attaining anuttara-samyak-sambodhi. Therefore I say I am not competent to visit him and ask about his illness."

The Buddha then said to the bodhisattva Upholder of the Age, "You must go visit Vimalakirti and ask about his illness." But Upholder of the Age said to the Buddha: "World-Honored

One, I am not competent to visit him and inquire about his illness. Why? Because I recall once when I was staying in my quiet room. At that time the devil king Papiyas, accompanied by twelve thousand heavenly maidens, appeared in the guise of the god Indra. Playing on musical instruments and singing, they came to where I was, and then the devil and his retinue bowed their heads at my feet, pressed their palms together, and stood to one side.

"I thought it was Indra, and I said to him, 'Welcome, Kaushika.3 Though you enjoy good fortune, you should never behave willfully. You should contemplate the impermanence of the five desires and strive thereby to plant good roots. With body, life, and resources you should cultivate the steadfast Law.'

"But Indra said to me, 'Upright one, please accept these twelve thousand heavenly maidens. They can serve and wait on you.' "I replied, 'Kaushika, a monk, a son of Shakyamuni, has no use for unlawful things such as these. It would not be right for me to accept them.'

"Before I had finished speaking, Vimalakirti approached and said to me, 'This is not Indra. This is only a devil who has come tó trouble and vex you.' Then he said to the devil, 'You may give these women to me. It is quite all right for me to accept them.'

"The devil was alarmed and fearful, thinking that Vimalakirti was perhaps going to make trouble for him. He tried to hide him-self and escape, but he could not make himself invisible. Though he exhausted all his supernatural powers, he could not get away

"Just then a voice was heard in the sky saying, 'Papiyas, give him the women. Then you can escape.'

"The devil, terrified, looked this way and that and then handed over the women. Vimalakirti then addressed the women, saying, 'The devil has given you to me. Now it is proper that you should all set your minds on attaining anuttara-samyak-sambodhi.'

"Then, adopting whatever approach was appropriate, he expounded the Law to them, awakening in them a desire for the Way. Then he said, 'Nów that you have conceived a desire for the Way, you may regale yourselves with Dharma delight and need no longer delight in the pleasures of the five desires.'

3 Kaushika is another name for Indra.

"The heavenly maidens asked, 'What is this you call Dharma delight?'

"Vimalakirti replied, 'To delight in constant faith in the Buddha, to delight in the desire to hear the Law, to delight in giving alms to the assembly, to delight in casting off the five desires, to delight in viewing the five components as vengeful bandits, to delight in viewing the four great elements as poisonous snakes, to delight in viewing the mind and the senses as an empty village, to delight in pursuing and guarding a desire for the Way, to delight in benefiting living beings, to delight in honoring and supporting teachers, to delight in practicing widespread generosity, to delight in strict observance of the precepts, to delight in patience, humility, gentleness, and harmony, to delight in diligently amassing good roots, to delight in meditation that is never disordered, to delight in bright, undefiled wisdom, to delight in broadening the mind that aspires to bodhi, to delight in conquering and subduing devils, to delight in cutting off all earthly desires, to delight in purifying the Buddha lands, to delight in gaining merits so that one may in time succeed in acquiring auspicious marks and characteristics, to delight in adorning the place of practice, to delight in listening fearlessly to profound teachings, to delight in the three gates to emancipation and not to delight in untimely teachings, to delight in being friendly with those of like learning, to delight in a mind free of anger and hostility when among those of unlike learning, to delight in guiding and protecting evil friends, to delight in being friendly with good friends, to delight in a mind that finds joy in purity, to delight in practicing the teachings regarding the immeasurable elements of the Way-these make up the Dharma delight of the bodhisattva.'

"Papiyas then addressed the women, saying, 'I want now to return with you to my heavenly palace.' But the women said ,

'You gave us to this layman. Possessing this Dharma delight that affords us such pleasure, we no longer delight in the pleasures of the five desires.'

"The devil said, 'Layman, you should give up these women. He who gives all he possesses as a gift to others is a bodhisattva.'

"Vimalakirti replied, 'I have already given them up. You may take them away, and may you enable all living beings to fulfill their desire for the Dharma!'

"But the women said to Vimalakirti, 'How can we remain in the palace of the devil?'

"Vimalakirti replied, 'Sisters, there is a teaching called the Inexhaustible Lamp. You must study it. This Inexhaustible Lamp is like a single lamp that lights a hundred or a thousand other lamps, till the darkness is all made bright with a brightness that never ends. In this same way, sisters, one bodhisattva guides and opens a path for a hundred or a thousand living beings, causing them to set their minds on attaining anuttara-samyak-sambodhi. And this desire for the Way will never be extinguished or go out. By following the teaching as it has been preached, one keeps adding until one has acquired all good teachings. This is what is called the Inexhaustible Lamp.

"'Although you live in the palace of the devil, with this Inexhaustible Lamp you can enable countless heavenly sons and heavenly daughters to set their minds on attaining anuttara-samyak-sambodhi. Thus you will repay the debt of gratitude you owe the Buddha and at the same time bring great benefit to all living beings.'

"At that time the heavenly maidens bowed their heads at Vimalakirti's feet and then accompanied the devil back to his palace, suddenly disappearing from sight. World-Honored One, such are the freely commanded supernatural powers, wisdom, and eloquence that Vimalakirti possesses! Therefore I say I am not competent to visit him."

The Buddha then said to Good Virtue, one of the wealthy men's sons, "You must go visit Vimalakirti and ask about his illness."

But Good Virtue said to the Buddha, "World-Honored One, I am not competent to visit him and inquire about his illness.

Why? Because I recall once when a great bestowal gathering4 was held at my father's house, where for a period of seven days alms were given out to all the monks, Brahmans and non-Buddhist believers, and to poor and humble folk, orphans, friendless persons and beggars.

"At that time Vimalakirti, who had joined the gathering, said to me, 'You are a wealthy man's son-you should not be holding a great bestowal gathering such as this. You should hold a gathering for Dharma bestowal. Why hold a gathering for the bestowal of mere material goods?'

"'Layman,' I said, 'what do you mean by a gathering for Dharma bestowal?'

"He replied, 'A gathering for Dharma bestowal is one which has no beginning and no end, in which alms are given out simultaneously to all living beings. What does this mean? It means that through bodhi one cultivates a loving mind, through saving living beings one cultivates a mind of great compassion, through adherence to the correct Law one cultivates a joyful mind, and through one's grasp of wisdom one exercises an indifferent mind.

"'By controlling stinginess and greed one carries out the paramita of dana or almsgiving, by converting those who violate the precepts one carries out the paramita of shila or keeping of the precepts, through the doctrine of no ego one carries out the paramita of kshanti or forbearance, by dispelling attachment to the characteristics of body and mind one carries out the paramita of virya or assiduousness, through an understanding of the nature of bodhi one carries out the paramita of dhyana or meditation, and through compřehensive wisdom one carries out the paramita of prajna or wisdom.

"'By teaching and converting living beings one comes to understand emptiness, by not casting aside conditioned phenomena one comes to understand formlessness, by recognizing that living beings take on visible form one comes to understand nonaction.

A Brahmanical ceremony marked by sacrifices to the gods and the dispensing of charity to those pursuing the religious life and to needy persons

"'By guarding and upholding the correct Law one acquires the power of expedient means, by rescuing living beings one acquires the four methods of winning people, by respecting and serving others one learns how to banish pride.

"'With regard to body, life, and wealth, one follows the doctrine that these three are indestructible;s with regard to the six objects of reverence, one follows the method of thoughtful meditation; with regard to the six types of harmonious respect one cultivates a straightforward mind. By correctly practicing the good Law one achieves a pure way of life; through purity of mind, joy and delight one draws near to the worthy ones and sages; by not hating evil persons one learns to temper and discipline one's mind.

"'By following the rules for those who have left the household life one cultivates a deeply searching mind; by carrying out religious practices in the prescribed way one acquires much learning; by observing ways that are free from contention one creates peaceful and uncrowded surroundings; by directing one's efforts toward Buddha wisdom one learns quiet meditation; by freeing living beings from their bonds one creates a setting for religious practice.

"'Acquiring auspicious marks and purifying the Buddha lands, one pursues actions that bring blessing and good fortune; understanding the minds and thoughts of all living beings and preaching the Law to them in an appropriate manner, one pursues actions that bring wisdom; understanding that all phenomena are neither to be seized nor rejected, one enters the doctrinal gate of the single nature of all phenomena and pursues wise actions; cutting off all earthly desires, all blocks and hindrances, all doctrines that are not good, one pursues all manner of good works; acquiring all types of wisdom, all good doctrines, one cultivates all the methods that aid one to the Buddha way.6

5 Not the ordinary body but the true or eternal body, etc.

"'This, my good man, is what I mean by a gathering for Dharma bestowal. If one is a bodhisattva and abides in such a gathering for Dharma bestowal, he may be deemed a great donor of alms, and he will also be creating a field of blessings for all the world.'

"World-Honored One, when Vimalakirti expounded the Law in this fashion, two hundred of the Br,ahmans gathered there all set their minds on attaining anuttara-samyak-sambodhi. At that time my mind gained a purity I had never known before and I sighed with delight. Bowing my head in obeisance at the feet of Vimalakirti, I took off my jeweled necklace worth hundreds and thousands in gold and presented it to him, but he was unwilling to accept it.

"'Layman,' I said, "I beg you by all means to accept this and to dispose of it as you wish.'

"Vimalakirti then accepted the necklace and divided it into two parts. One part he gave to the lowliest beggars in the assembly, and one part he presented to the Thus Come One Rarely Surpassed. At that time all the members of the gathering were able to see Thus Come One Rarely Surpassed in his land called Light Bright, and they could also see the necklace placed on his person. Then the necklace changed into a jeweled dias fitted with four pillars, richly adorned on four sides but without screens or obstructions enclosing it.

6 There are places in this troublesome passage where cause and effect seem to be in the reverse of their logical order; for example, one would expect the text to say that because one possesses a mind of great compassion, one seeks to save living beings, not that through saving living beings one acquires a mind of great compassion. But the Chinese seems to be saying the latter, and translations of the Tibetan version bear out this interpretation of the syntax throughout the passage. Note that Charles Luk, apparently in an effort to avoid such difficulties, in his translation of the Chinese (p. 46) arbitrarily reverses the order of cause and effect in the latter part of the passage.

"Vimalakirti, having worked these supernatural wonders, then spoke these words:'If a donor of alms bestows gifts on the lowliest beggars with equality of mind, dispensing them with impartiality as the Thus Come One does in his field of blessings; if one exercises great compassion in equal measure without seeking reward or recompense, this may be called a perfectly performed Dharma bestowal.'

"Then the lowliest beggars in the city, seeing these displays of supernatural power and hearing the words of doctrine that Vimalakirti had spoken, all set their minds on the attainment of anuttara-samyak-sambodhi. Therefore I say I am not competent to visit him and ask about his illness."

In this manner the various bodhisattvas one by one described to the Buddha some past encounter with Vimalakirti and praised the words he had spoken on that occasion, and all declared that they were not competent to visit him and ask about his illness.

Chapter 5
INQUIRING ABOUT THE ILLNESS
At that time the Buddha said to Manjushri, "You must go visit Vimalakirti and inquire about his illness."

Manjushri replied to the Buddha, "World-Honored One, that eminent man is very difficult to confront. He is profoundly enlightened in the true nature of reality and skilled at preaching the essentials of the Law. His eloquence never falters, his wisdom is free of impediments. He understands all the rules of bodhisattva conduct, and nothing in the secret storehouse of the Buddhas is beyond his grasp. He has overcome the host of devils and disports himself with transcendental powers. In wisdom and expedient means he has mastered all there is to know. Nevertheless, in obedience to the Buddha's august command, I will go visit him and inquire about his illness."

Then the bodhisattvas and major disciples in the assembly, the Brahmas, Indras, and Four Heavenly Kings, all thought to themselves: "Now these two great men, Manjushri and Vimalakirti, will be talking together, and they will surely expound the wonderful Law!"At that time eight thousand bodhisattvas, five hundred voice-hearers, and hundreds and thousands of heavenly beings all decided at once that they would like to accompany Manjushri on his visit.

Manjushri, with this throng of bodhisattvas, major disciples, and heavenly beings reverently surrounding and accompanying him, proceeded to enter the city of Vaishali.

At that time the rich man Vimalakirti thought to himself, "Now Manjushri is coming with that great assembly!"At once he employed his supernatural powers to empty the room, clearing it of all its contents and his attendants, leaving only a single bed on which he lay in sickness.

When Manjushri entered the house, he saw that the room was bare of contents, with just one bed, Vimalakirti lying alone on it. Vimalakirti said, "Welcome, Manjushri! You come without the marks of coming, you see me without the marks of seeing me."

Manjushri said, "Just so, layman. What has already come can hardly be coming. And what has already departed can hardly be departing. What do I mean? What comes has nowhere it comes from, what departs has nowhere it goes, and what is seen cannot be further seen.l But let us put that aside for the moment.

"Layman, this illness of yours-can you endure it? Is the treatment perhaps not making it worse rather than better? The World-Honored One countless times has made solicitous inquiries concerning you. Layman, what is the cause of this illness? Has it been with you long? And how can it be cured?"

Vimalakirti replied, "This illness of mine is born of ignorance and feelings of attachment. Because all living beings are sick, therefore I am sick. If all living beings are relieved of sickness, then my sickness will be mended. Why? Because the bodhisattva for the sake of living beings enters the realm of birth and death, and because he is in the realm of birth and death he suffers illness. If living beings can gain release from illness, then the bodhisattva will no longer be ill.

"It is like the case of a rich man who has only one child. If the child falls ill, then the father and mother too will be ill, but if the child's illness is cured, the father and mother too will be cured. The bodhisattva is like this, for he loves living beings as though they were his children. If living beings are sick, the bodhisattva will be sick, but if living beings are cured, the bodhisattva too will be cured. You ask what cause this illness arises from-the illness of the bodhisattva arises from his great compassion."

1 Vimalakirti and Manjushri do a brief pas de deux on the theme of non-dualism before entering on their main dialogue.

Manjushri said, "Layman, why is this room empty and without attendants?"

Vimalakirti replied, "The lands of the Buddhas too are all empty "

"Why are they empty?"

"They are empty because of emptiness," Vimalakirti replied. "And why is emptiness empty?" asked Manjushri.

"It is empty of distinctions, therefore it is empty," was the reply.

"Can emptiness itself be the subject of distinctions?" asked Manjushri.

"Distinctions too are empty," was the reply.

"How then is emptiness to be sought?" asked Manjushri. "It may be sought in the sixty-two erroneous views of the non-Buddhists," was the reply

"How are the sixty-two views to be sought?" asked Manjushri.

"They may be sought in the emancipation of the Buddhas", was the reply.

"And how is the emancipation of the Buddhas to be sought?" asked Manjushri.

"It may be sought in the minds and actions of all living beings," replied Vimalakirti. "And you asked why I am without attendants. But in fact the whole host of devils and the non-Buddhist believers are all my attendants. Why? Because the host of devils delight in the realm of birth and death, and while the bodhisattva is in the realm of birth and death he does not scorn their company. The non-Buddhist believers delight in various views of reality, and the bodhisattva knows how to remain unmoved by such views."

Manjushri said, "This illness of yours, layman-what form does it take?"

"My illness has no form," replied Vimalakirti. "It cannot be seen."

Manjushri said, "Is this illness seated in the body or in the mind?"

"It is not seated in the body, for it is apart from bodily form", replied Vimalakirti. "And it is not seated in the mind, for the mind is a phantomlike thing."

"Of the four major elements, earth, water, fire, and wind, to which of these elements does this illness pertain?" asked Manjushri.

Vimalakirti replied, "This illness does not pertain to the element earth, but neither is it separated from the element earth. And the same may be said of the elements water, fire, and wind. Yet the illnesses of living beings arise from the four elements. And because living beings have these illnesses, therefore I too am ill."

Then Manjushri asked Vimalakirti, "How should a bodhisattva go about comforting and instructing another bodhisattva who is ill?"

Vimalakirti replied, "Tell him about the impermanence of the body, but do not tell him to despise or turn away from the body. Tell him about the sufferings of the body, but do not tell him to strive for nirvana. Tell him that the body is without ego, but urge him to teach and guide living beings. Tell him of the emptiness of the body, but do not tell him of its final extinction. Tell him to repent of former offenses, but do not tell him to consign them to the past. Tell him to use his own illness as a means of sympathizing with the illness of others, for he should understand their sufferings throughout the countless kalpas of their past existence, and should think how he can bring benefit to all living beings. Tell him to recall the good fortune he has won through religious practice, to concentrate on a life of purity, and not to give way to gloom or worry. He should cultivate constant diligence, striving to become a king of physicians who can heal the ailments of the assembly. This is how a bodhisattva should comfort and instruct a bodhisattva who is ill so as to make him feel happy"

Manjushri said, "Layman, how should a bodhisattva who is ill go about tempering and controlling his mind?"

Vimalakirti replied, "A bodhisattva who is ill should think to himself: 'Now these illnesses of mine all spring from the deluded thoughts, the upside-down thinking and various earthly desires of my past existence. They have no real existence, so who is it who suffers illness? Why? The four major elements come together, and therefore we apply a makeshift name, calling the thing a body. But the four major elements have no master, and the body has no "I" or ego. And these illnesses too all arise from attachment to ego. Therefore I should harbor no such attachment to ego.'

"Once one has understood the origin of illness, one may do away with the thought of an I or ego, and the thought of other living beings. To do so, one should call up the thought of phenomena, thinking to oneself: 'It is simply that various phenomena have come together to form this body. It has appeared simply because phenomena appeared, and it will vanish simply because phenomena vanish. And these phenomena are none of them known to one another. When they appear, they do not say, "I have appeared!," and when they vanish, they do not say, "I have vanished!"

"Then, in order to wipe out the thought of phenomena, the ailing bodhisattva should think to himself: 'This thought or concept of phenomena too is a form of upside-down thinking, and upside-down thinking can lead to great misfortune. I must rid myself of it. But how to rid myself of it? By ridding myself of thoughts of I and mine, which means ridding myself of dualism.'

"What is meant by ridding oneself of dualism? It means not thinking of phenomena as internal or external, but treating all as equal. What is meant by equal? It means that I and nirvana are treated as equal. Why? Because I and nirvana are both empty. Why are they empty? Because they are mere names, hence empty Neither of these two phenomena has any fixed nature or characteristics. Once one has acquired this kind of equal outlook, one will be freed of all other illness and will have only the illness of emptiness, and the illness of emptiness too is empty.

"This ailing bodhisattva of ours has no sensations of pain or pleasure, and yet he allows himself to feel such sensations, and while the Law of the Buddha is incompletely practiced he does not seek to wipe out such sensations in himself and gain entry into final enlightenment. If he feels pain in his body, he thinks of the living beings in the evil realms of existence and summons up a mind of great compassion, saying to himself: 'I have regulated and controlled myself, and now I must regulate and control other living beings!' But he should simply rid them of their illnesses and not deprive them of anything, merely teaching and guiding them so they can cut off the source of illness.

"What is meant by the source of illness? It means having troublesome entanglements. Where there are troublesome entanglements, these become the source of illness. What are these troublesome entanglements tied to? They are tied to the threefold world. And how does one cut them off? By realizing that there is nothing to grasp at. If one ceases to grasp at any-thing, there will be no more troublesome entanglements.

"What is meant by realizing there is nothing to grasp at? It means having done with dualistic views. What is meant by dualistic views? it means viewing this as internal, or viewing that as external. [Have done with such views] and there will be no more grasping at things.

"Manjushri, this is how the ailing bodhisattva should go about regulating and controlling his mind. By doing so, he cuts off the sufferings of old age, sickness, and death. If he fails to do so, then all his religious practice and accomplishment in the past will be void of wisdom or profit. A person who has overcome a sworn enemy deserves to be called a hero. In the same way, one who has cut off both old age, sickness, and death may be called a bodhisattva.

"This ailing bodhisattva should also think to himself: This illness of mine has no reality, no existence, and the illnesses of other living beings likewise have no reality and no existence/ When he adopts this view, if he should conceive a great compassion that is marked by affection and concern for living beings, he should at once thrust it aside. Why? Because the bodhisattva must rid himself of all earthly passions caused by external defilement when he summons up his great compassion. If his compassion is marked by affection and concern, then he will have feelings of weariness and revulsion toward the realm of birth and death. But if he can put aside affection and concern, he will feel no weariness and revulsion; whatever realm he happens to be born into, he will not be blinded by affection or concern.

"He is not bound by the conditions of his birth, and hence he is able to preach the Law for living beings and liberate them from their bonds. As the Buddha has said, if one is in bonds himself, to suppose he can free others from their bonds is hardly reasonable. But if one is himself free of bonds, it is perfectly reasonable to assume he can free the bonds of others. Therefore the bodhisattva must not conjure up bonds for himself.

"What is meant by bonds and what is meant by liberation? To become infatuated with the taste of meditation is the bondage of the bodhisattva. To be born in this world as a form of expedient means is the liberation of the bodhisattva. Wisdom without expedient means is bondage; wisdom with expedient means is liberation. Expedient means without wisdom is bondage; expedient means with wisdom is liberation.2

2 In this passage, wisdom stands for the correct mental attitude of the bodhisattva in his efforts to lead others to enlightenment, and expedient means stands for the actual methods he employs. The process of liberation or enlightenment is successfully completed only when both attitude and method are correct.

"What is meant by saying that wisdom without expedient means is bondage? It means that, with a mind full of affection and concern, a bodhisattva sets about to adorn the Buddha lands, lead numerous living beings to them, and regulate himself with the doctrines of emptiness, formlessness, and nonaction. This is called the bondage of wisdom without expedient means.

"What is meant by saying that wisdom with expedient means is liberation? It means that, with a mind free of affection and concern, a bodhisattva sets about to adorn the Buddha lands, lead numerous living beings to them, and regulate himself with the doctrines of emptiness, formlessness, and nonaction, never experiencing weariness or revulsion. This is called the liberation of wisdom with expedient means.

"What is meant by saying that expedient means without wisdom is bondage? It means that, while dwelling among the various earthly passions such as greed, anger, and erroneous views, a bodhisattva sets about planting many roots of virtue. This is called the bondage of expedient means without wisdom.

"What is meant by saying that expedient means with wisdom is liberation? It means that, while removing himself from the various earthly passions such as greed, anger, and erroneous views, a bodhisattva sets about planting many roots of virtue, bending all his efforts in the direction of anuttara-samyak-sambodhi. This is called the liberation of expedient means with wisdom.

"Manjushri, the ailing bodhisattva should view all phenomena in this way. And he should view the body and realize that it is marked by impermanence, suffering, emptiness, and absence of ego. This is called wisdom. But though his body may be ailing, he should constantly abide in the realm of birth and death, bringing benefit to all living beings and never giving in to weariness or revulsion. This is called expedient means.

"He should further view the body and realize that the body is never rid of illness, that illness is never rid of the body, and that this body and this illness are neither prior nor posterior to one another. This is called wisdom. But though his body is ailing, the bodhisattva never seeks escape into eternal extinction. This is called expedient means.

"Manjushri, the ailing bodhisattva should regulate his mind by not dwelling in such regulation, but he should not dwell in nonregulation of the mind either. Why? Because if he dwells in nonregulation of the mind, this is the way of a stupid person. But if he dwells in regulation of the mind, this is the way of a voice-hearer. Therefore the bodhisattva should dwell neither in regulation nor in nonregulation of the mind. To remove himself from such dualisms is the practice of the bodhisattva.

"To be in the realm of birth and death without following its tainted ways, to dwell in nirvana while not seeking eternal extinction-such is the practice of the bodhisattva. The practice that is neither that of common mortals nor that of worthies and sages-such is the practice of the bodhisattva. The practice that is neither sullied nor pure-such is the practice of the bodhisattva. Though far transcending the workings of devils, it shows itself in the conquering of numerous devils-such is the practice of the bodhisattva. Seeking comprehensive wisdom, yet not seeking it when the time is not right-such is the practice of the bodhisattva.

"Though he sees that all things are birthless in nature, he does not enter the realm of the absolute-such is the practice of the bodhisattva. Though he sees all in the light of the twelve-linked chain of causation, he can enter into various erroneous views-such is the practice of the bodhisattva. Though he addresses himself to all living beings, he does so without affection or attachment-such is the practice of the bodhisattva. Though he longs to be far removed from the passions, he does not seek this through elimination of the body and mind-such is the practice of the bodhisattva.

"Though he moves in the threefold world, he does no injury to the Dharma-nature-such is the practice of the bodhisattva.

Though he moves in the realm of emptiness, he plants many roots of virtue-such is the practice of the bodhisattva. Though he moves in the realm of formlessness, he yet saves many living beings-such is the practice of the bodhisattva. Though he moves in the realm of nonaction, he manifests himself by taking on a body-such is the practice of the bodhisattva. Though he avoids the arousal of passion, he rouses in himself the determination to do all good deeds-such is the practice of the bodhisattva.

"Though he practices the six paramitas, he can understand the minds and mental activities of all living beings-such is the practice of the bodhisattva. Though he is master of the six transcendental powers, he does not remove himself from all defilements-such is the practice of the bodhisattva. Though he possesses the four immeasurable qualities of mind, he is not greedy for birth in the Brahma heaven-such is the practice of the bodhisattva. Though he practices meditation, emancipation, and samadhi, he does not accept the rebirth that is consequent on these practices-such is the practice of the bodhisattva.

"Though he practices the four states of mindfulness, in the end he does not for long remove himself from the objects of such mindfulness, the body, sensations, the mind, and things-such is the practice of the bodhisattva. Though he applies him-self to the four types of correct effort, he does not cease to be assiduous in matters pertaining to body and mind-such is the practice of the bodhisattva. Though he cultivates the four bases of supernatural power, he is already able to wield transcendental powers at will-such is the practice of the bodhisattva. Though he cultivates the five roots of goodness in himself, he can also distinguish whether the roots or capacities of other living beings are keen or dull-such is the practice of the bodhisattva. Though he possesses the five powers [attained through the five roots of goodness], he delights in seeking to acquire the ten powers of a Buddha-such is the practice of the bodhisattva. Though he observes the seven factors of enlightenment, he can understand all the fine points of the Buddha wisdom-such is the practice of the bodhisattva. Though he walks the eightfold holy path, he also delights in walking the immeasurable Buddha way-such is the practice of the bodhisattva.

"Though he practices concentration and insight as methods to aid one to the way, in the end he does not sink into tranquil extinction-such is the practice of the bodhisattva. Though fully aware that all things are without birth or extinction, he adorns his body with auspicious features-such is the practice of the bodhisattva. Though outwardly displaying the dignity of a voice-hearer or pratyekabuddha, he never forsakes the Buddha Law-such is the practice of the bodhisattva. Though aware that all things in the end are pure in nature, he responds to circum-stances by showing himself in bodily form-such is the practice of the bodhisattva. Though insight tells him that all Buddha lands are eternally tranquil and empty in nature, yet he displays various kinds of pure Buddha lands-such is the practice of the bodhisattva. Though he attains Buddhahood, turns the wheel of the Law, and enters nirvana, in fact he never forsakes the bodhisattva way-such is the practice of the bodhisattva."

When Vimalakirti spoke these words, eight thousand heavenly sons in the great assembly led by Manjushri all set their minds on attaining anuttara-samyak-sambodhi.

Chapter 6
BEYOND COMPREHENSION
At that time Shariputra, observing that there were no seats in Vimalakirti's room, thought to himself: "All these bodhisattvas and major disciples-where are they going to sit?"

The rich man Vimalakirti, knowing what was in his mind, said to Shariputra, "Did you come here for the sake of the Law, or are you just looking for a place to sit?"

"I came for the Law, not for a seat!" said Shariputra.

"Ah, Shariputra," said Vimalaldrti, "a seeker of the Law doesn't concern himself even about life or limb, much less about a seat! A seeker of the Law seeks nothing in the way of form, perception, conception, volition, or consciousness; he seeks nothing in the way of sense-realms or sense-media; he seeks nothing in the threefold world of desire, form, and formlessness.

"Ah, Shariputra, a seeker of the Law does not seek it through attachment to the Buddha, does not seek it through attachment to the Law, does not seek it through attachment to the order. A seeker of the Law does not seek it through recognition of suffering, does not seek it through renunciation of attachments, does not seek it through realization of how to end attachments, or through practice of the Way.l Why? Because the Law has nothing to do with idle theorizing. To declare that one must recognize suffering, renounce attachments, realize how to reach extinction, and practice the Way is mere idle theorizing, not seeking the Law.

1 These are the four noble truths, that existence is suffering, that suffering is caused by craving or attachment, that there is a way to end craving, that it can be done through practice of the eightfold path.

"Ah, Shariputra, the Law is called 'tranquil extinction.' But if one strives for birth followed by extinction, this is seeking birth and extinction, this is not seeking the Law. The Law is called 'unstained.' But if one is stained with the idea of the Law or of nirvana, then one is stained with attachment, and this is not seeking the Law. The Law has no goal of activity, but if one actively pursues the Law, one is pursuing a goal, and this is not seeking the Law. The Law knows no picking and choosing, but if one picks and chooses the Law, this is picking and choosing, not seeking the Law. The Law is independent of place, but if one fixes on the idea of place, this is fixation with place, not a seeking of the Law The Law is called 'formless.' If one tries to know it through form, this is seeking form, not seeking the Law.

"The Law is not something that can be resided in. If one tries to reside in it, this is trying to reside in the Law, not seeking the Law. The Law is not something that can be seen, heard, perceived, or understood. If one tries to see, hear, perceive, and understand it, this is trying to see, hear, perceive, and understand the Law, not seeking the Law. The Law is called 'unconditioned.' If one tries to approach it through the conditioned, this is seeking the conditioned, not seeking the Law

"Therefore, Shariputra, if one would be a seeker of the Law, one must not seek it in anything at all."

When Vimalakirti spoke these words, five hundred heavenly sons gained the purity of the Dharma eye in their perception of phenomena.

At that time the rich man Vimalakirti said to Manjushri, "You have visited countless thousands, ten thousands, billions of asamkhyas of countries. What Buddha lands have the finest and most beautiful lion seats, those endowed with the best quaJities?"

Manjushri replied, "Layman, to the east, beyond countries numerous as the sands of thirty-six Ganges, lies a world called Sumeru Shape. Its Buddha is named Sumeru Lamp King, and he is there now This Buddha's body is eighty-four thousand yojanas in height and the lion seat [he sits on] is eighty-four thousand yojanas high and adorned in the finest fashion."

The rich man Vimalakirti then exercised his transcendental powers and at once that Buddha dispatched thirty-two thousand lion seats, tall, broad, adorned, and pure, and had them brought into Vimalakirti's room, where the bodhisattvas, major disciples, Indras, Brahmas, Four Heavenly Kings and the others saw something they had never seen before. For the room was broad and spacious enough to hold all these thirty-two thou-sand lion seats without the slightest crowding or hindrance. The city of Vaishali and Jambudvipa and the other of the four continents too seemed in no way cramped or inconvenienced, but all appeared just as usual.

At that time Vimalakirti said to Manjushri, "Sit down in one of the lion seats! The bodhisattvas and other distinguished persons -should also sit down, but when they do so they should assume bodies suitabJe to the size of the seat."

The bodhisattvas who had acquired transcendental powers thereupon immediately transformed their shapes, making themselves forty-two yojanas tall, and sat down in the lion seats. But among the bodhisattvas who had newly embarked on their course or the major disciples, there were none who could climb up into the seats.

At that time Vimalakirti said to Shariputra, "Sit down in a lion seat!"

But Shariputra said, "Layman, these seats are too tall and wide-we can't climb up in them!"

Vimalakirti said, "Ah, Shariputra, if you will make obeisance to the Thus Come One Sumeru Lamp King, then you will be able to take a seat."

The bodhisattvas who had newly embarked on their course and the major disciples accordingly made obeisance to the Thus Come One Sumeru Lamp King, and after that they were able to seat themselves in the lion seats.

Shariputra said, "Layman, I have never seen such a thing! A little room like this and still it can hold seats as tall and broad as these! And the city of Vaishali is in no way crowded or obstructed, nor are any of the towns or villages of Jambudvipa or of the other of the four continents cramped or inconvenienced, or the palaces of the heavenly beings, dragon kings and spirits i "

Vimalakirti said, "Ah, Shariputra, the Buddhas and bodhisattvas have an emancipation that is called Beyond Comprehension. When a bodhisattva dwells in this emancipation, he can take something as tall and broad as Mount Sumeru and put it inside a mustard seed without enlarging one or shrinking the other, and Mount Sumeru, king of mountains, will still have its original shape. Moreover, the Four Heavenly Kings and the gods of the Trayastrimsha heaven [who live on Mount Sumeru] will not even know or realize where they have gone to. Only those destined for enlightenment will be able to see that Sumeru has been put inside a mustard seed. This is called dwelling in the doctrine of the emancipation Beyond Comprehension.

"Or again, this bodhisattva can take the waters of the four great oceans and pour them into the opening that holds a single hair, without the fish, turtles, sea turtles, lizards, or other sea creatures being in any way troubled, and those great seas will still have their original form. And the dragons, spirits, asuras, and others [who live in the sea] will not know or realize where they have gone to, and these beings will not be at all troubled.

"Or again, Shariputra, this bodhisattva who dwells in the emancipation Beyond Comprehension can slice off the thousand-millionfold world, grasp it in the palm of his right hand like a potter's wheel, and toss it beyond lands numerous as the sands of the Ganges, and the beings in that world will not know or realize where they have gotten to. The bodhisattva can then bring it back and put it in its original place, and none of the people will have any idea they have gone somewhere and come back, and the world will have the same shape as before.

"Again, Shariputra, suppose there are beings who want to live in this world for a long time but are qualified to enter enlightenment. This bodhisattva can stretch seven days into a kalpa, so that to those beings they really seem like a whole kalpa. Or if there are beings who do not want to live in this world for long and they are qualified to enter enlightenment, this bodhisattva can squeeze a kalpa into seven days, so that to those beings it seems like only seven days.

"Again, Shariputra, the bodhisattva who dwells in the emancipation Beyond Comprehension can take the magnificent adornments from all the Buddha lands, gather them together, and show them to the beings living in a single country Or this bodhisattva can place all the beings of a single Buddha land in the palm of his right hand and fly with them all around the ten directions, showing them everything, and yet never move from his original spot.

"Or, Shariputra, this bodhisattva can take all the objects offered to the Buddhas by the beings in the worlds in the ten directions and make them all visible within a pore that holds a single hair, or take all the suns, moon, stars, and constellations that belong to the worlds in the ten directions and make them visible within the pore of a single hair Or, Shariputra, he can suck into his mouth all the winds from the worlds in the ten directions without doing any harm to himself or breaking down the trees that grow there. Or, when the worlds in the ten directions come to the end of the kalpa and everything is destroyed by fire, he can take all those fires and hold them in his belly, and though the fires go on burning as before, the bodhisattva suffers no harm. Or he can go down into the lower region, past Buddha lands numerous as the sands of the Ganges, pick up one Buddha land, and lift it to the upper region, above Buddha lands numerous as the sands of the Ganges, as one would lift the leaf of a jujube tree on the point of a needle, and that land will be in no way troubled.

"Or, Shariputra, the bodhisattva who dwells in the emancipation Beyond Comprehension can use his transcendental powers to make himself appear in the body of a Buddha, or the body of a pratyekabuddha, or that of a voice-hearer, an Indra, a Brahma king, one of the Four Heavenly Kings, or a wheel-turning king. Or again he can take all the voices uttered by the beings in the worlds of the ten directions, high, middle, and low-grade sounds, and transform them all into the voice of the Buddha. He can make these voices discourse with the sounds of 'impermanence', 'suffering,' 'emptiness,' or 'non-ego,' or expound all the various other doctrines preached by the Buddhas of the ten directions, and cause those doctrines to be heard everywhere.

"Shariputra, I have just now briefly described the powers possessed by this bodhisattva of the emancipation Beyond Comprehension. If I were to describe them in full, I could go on for a whole kalpa and never have done."

At that time Mahakashyapa, hearing this discourse on the doctrine of the emancipation Beyond Comprehension, sighed at encountering what he had never heard before, and said to Shariputra, "It is like someone displaying various painted images before a blind man when he cannot see them. In the same way, when we voice-hearers hear this doctrine of the emancipation Beyond Comprehension, we are all incapable of understanding it. If wise persons hear it, there will be none who do not set their minds on attaining anuttara-samyak-sambodhi. But what of us, who are forever cut off at the root, who with regard to these Great Vehicle teachings have already become like rotten seed?2

2 The voice-hearers, who represent Hinayana Buddhism, because they have taken as their goal the attainment of the state of arhat, have in effect cut themselves off at the root from the search for the higher goal of Buddhahood, the goal of Great Uehicle or Mahayana Buddhist doctrine and practice. In Mahayana terms, the potential for Buddhahood inherent in the voice-hearers has become like rotten seed that will never sprout.

When voice-hearers hear this doctrine of the emancipation Beyond Comprehension, they will surely all cry out in anguish in voices loud enough to shake the whole thousand-millionfold world. But bodhisattvas should all accept this teaching with great joy and thanksgiving. For if there are bodhisattvas who put faith in this doctrine of the emancipation Beyond Comprehension, then none of the host of devils can do anything to them!"

When Mahakashyapa spoke these words, thirty-two thousand offspring of the gods set their minds on the attainment of anuttara-samyak-sambodhi.

At that time Vimalakirti said to Mahakashyapa, "Sir, among those who play the part of devil kings in the immeasurable asamkhyas of worlds in the ten directions, there are many who in fact are bodhisattvas dwelling in the emancipation Beyond Comprehension. They employ their skill in expedient means to teach and convert living beings by appearing in the guise of devil kings.

"Or again, Kashyapa, with regard to the immeasurable numbers of bodhisattvas in the ten directions, sometimes people come to them begging for a hand or a foot, an ear, a nose, a head, an eye, marrow or brains, blood, flesh, skin, bones, or for their villages, towns, wives and children, men and women servants, elephants, horses, carriages, or for gold, lapis lazuli, seashell, agate, coral, amber, pearls, agate shell, clothing, food or drink. Many of those who beg in this fashion are bodhisattvas who dwell in the emancipation Beyond Comprehension. They employ their skill in expedient means and go to the other bodhisattvas to test them and make sure they are firm in their resolve [to give alms]. How can they do this? Because the bodhisattvas who dwell in the emancipation Beyond Comprehension possess powers of authority and virtue that enable them to importune others and make them perform difficult feats in this manner.3 Ordinary persons of inferior type have no such powers and hence cannot importune others as these bodhisattvas do. They are like donkeys who cannot stand up before the kicking and trampling of dragons or elephants.

"This is what is called the wisdom and expedient means possessed by the bodhisattvas who dwell in the emancipation Beyond Comprehension."

3 In speaking of people being importuned for an eye or some other part of the body, Vimalakirti probably has in mind the various tales in Buddhist lore of deities who take on devilish form and beg practitioners of the way for a piece of their body as a means of testing their dedication to the paramita of almsgiving. Vimalakirti is thus suggesting that the difficulties that Mahakashyapa and the other voice-hearers face may in fact just be a means of testing their resolve.

Chapter 7
REGARDING LIVING BEINGS
At that time Manjushri asked Vimalakirti, "How does the bodhisattva regard living beings?"

Vimalakirti replied, "As a conjurer looks on the beings he conjures up-thus does the bodhisattva regard living beings. As the wise view the moon in the water, or a face or form seen in a mirror; as shimmers of heat in a torrid season, as the echo that follows a cry, as clouds in the sky, as foam on the water, bubbles on the water, as a thing no firmer that the trunk of the plantain, no longer lasting than a flash of lightning; as a fifth great element, a sixth component, a seventh sense-media, a thirteenth sense-media, a nineteenth sense-realml-thus does the bodhisattva regard living beings.

"As forms in the world of formlessness, as sprouts from charred grain, as mistaken views of the body in one who has entered the stream that leads to the state of arhat, as a reentering of the womb by one no longer subject to rebirth, as the three poisons of greed, anger, and ignorance in ari arhat, as greed, anger, or violation of the precepts on the part of a bodhisattva who has accepted the birthless nature of all existence, as vestiges of earthly desire in a Buddha, as forms seen by a blind person, as the breathing in and out of one immersed in the samadhi of utter tranquility, as the tracks of a bird in the sky, as a child born to a barren woman, as, earthly desires in a phantom being, as sights in a dream after one has wakened, as the taking on of bodily form by one who has entered extinction, as fire that has no smoke-thus does the bodhisattva regard living beings."

1 That is, as one more of each category than actually exists.

Manjushri said, "If the bodhisattva looks on beings in this way, how can he treat them with compassion?"

Vimalakirti replied, "When the bodhisattva has finished regarding them in this way, he thinks to himself. 'For the sake of living beings I must preach this Law to them!' This is true compassion.

"He treats them with a compassion of tranquil extinction, for it results in no birth; treats them with a compassion unburning, for it is void of earthly desires; treats them with a compassion that is impartial, as the three existences of past, present, and future are impartial; treats them with a compassion free of contention, for nothing arises to oppose it; treats them with a compassion undualistic, for internal and external have no place in it; treats them with a compassion unfaltering, for it carries through to the end; treats them with a compassion firm and durable, for the mind of the bodhisattva never flags; treats them with a compassion clean and pure, as the nature of all phenomena is pure; treats them with a compassion boundless, boundless as the empty sky.

"He treats them with the compassion of the arhat, who has conquered the thieves of desire; treats them with the compassion of the bodhisattva, who brings contentment to all beings; treats them with the compassion of the Thus Come One, who has grasped the marks of Suchness; treats them with the compassion of the Buddha, who awakens living beings; treats them with a compassion wholly natural, understanding that it is causeless; treats them with a compassion of bodhi, which is of one flavor only; treats them with a compassion that has no gradation, for it cuts off all favoritism; treats them with great pity and compassion, guiding them with the Great Vehicle.

"He treats them with a compassion that never despairs, seeing that all is empty and without ego; treats them with the compassion of bestowal of the Law, never stinting in its gifts; treats them with the compassion of observance of the precepts, training those who break them to do better; treats them with the compassion of forbearance, guarding both others and self; treats them with the compassion of assiduousness, shouldering all beings as its burden; treats them with the compassion of meditation, unaffected by taste; treats them with the compassion of wisdom, which always knows the right time; treats them with the compassion of expedient means, with manifestations suited to every occasion.

"He treats them with a compassion that hides nothing, proceeding with the purity of an upright mind; treats them with the compassion of a deeply searching mind, one free of irrelevant motion; treats them with a compassion that is unerring, innocent of falsity and sham; treats them with a compassion full of peace and delight, for through it they gain the delight of the Buddha. Such is the compassion of the bodhisattva."

Continuing his questioning, Manjushri asked, "What do you mean when you speak of pity?"

"I mean that whatever benefits the bodhisattva gains, he shares them all with all other living beings," replied Vimalakirti. Manjushri: "What do you mean by joy?"

Vimalakirti: "Any way the bodhisattva can aid or enrich others he views as an occasion for joy and never for regret." Manjushri: "What do you mean by indifference?" Vimalakirti: "Whatever blessings or good fortune the bodhisattva bestows, he expects nothing in return."2

Manjushri then asked, "If the bodhisattva fears the cycle of birth and death, what should he rely on?"

Vimalakirti replied, "The bodhisattva, fearing the cycle of birth and death, should rely on the power of the Tathagata's blessings." Manjushri: "If he hopes to rely on the power of the Tathagata's blessings, what course should he pursue?"

2 Compassion, pity, joy, and indif ference constitute the four immeasurable qualities. See glossary.

Vimalakirti: "If he hopes to rely on the power of the Tathagata's blessings, he should devote himself to saving and liberating all living beings."

Manjushri: "If he hopes to save living beings, what must he free them from?"

Vimalakirti: "If he hopes to save living beings, he must free them from earthly desires."

Manjushri: "If he hopes to free them from earthly desires, how should he proceed?"

Vimalakirti: "He should proceed by the method of correct mindfulness."

Manjushri: "How does one proceed by the method of correct mindfulness?"

Vimalakirti: "One proceeds on the premise of no birth and no extinction."

Manjushri: "What has no birth, and what has no extinction?" Vimalakirti: "The not good has no birth, the good has no extinction."

Manjushri: "What is the root of good and not good?" Vimalakirti: "The body is the root."

Manjushri: "What is the root of the body?" Vimalakirti: "Desire and greed are the root." Manjushri: "What is the root of desire and greed?" Vimalakirti: "False and empty distinctions are the root." Manjushri: "What is the root of false and empty distinctions?" Vimalakirti: "Topsy-turvy thinking is the root."

Manjushri: "What is the root of topsy-turvy thinking?" Vimalakirti: "Groundless assumptions are the root of topsy-turvy thinking."

Manjushri: "What is the root of groundless assumptions?" Vimalakirti: "What is groundless can have no root. Manjushri, it is on the root of this groundlessness that all the other concepts are built up."

At that time there was a heavenly being, a goddess, in Vimalakirti's room who, seeing these great men and hearing them expound the Law, proceeded to make herself visible and, taking heavenly flowers, scattered them over the bodhisattvas and major disciples. When the flowers touched the bodhisattvas, they all fell to the floor at once, but when they touched the major disciples, they stuck to them and did not fall off. The disciples all tried to shake off the flowers through their supernatural powers, but they could not do so.

At that time the goddess said to Shariputra, "Why try to brush off the flowers?"

"Such flowers are not in accordance with the Law," he replied. "That's why I try to brush them off."3

The goddess said, "Don't say these flowers are not in accordance with the Law. Why? Because the flowers make no such distinctions. You in your thinking have made up these distinctions, that's all. If one who has left the household life to follow the Buddha's Law makes such distinctions, that is not in accordance with the Law. One must be without distinctions to be in accordance with the Law Look at the bodhisattvas-the flowers do not stick to them because they have already cut off all thought of distinctions. Just as evil spirits are able to take advantage of a person who is beset by fear, so because you disciples are fearful of the cycle of birth and death, the senses of form, sound, smell, taste, and touch are able to take advantage of you. But once a person has done away with fear, then the five desires that arise from these senses will not be able to get at him. So long as one has not done away with all such entanglements, the flowers will stick to him. But they will not stick to someone who has eliminated them all."

Shariputra said, "Goddess, have you been staying in this room long?"

She replied, "Venerable sir, my stay in this room is about as long as your attainment of emancipation."

3 The wearing of flowers or other personal ornaments was forbidden to members of the Buddhist order.

Shariputra said, "So you've been here a long time?" "Venerable sir," said the goddess, "how long has your attainment of emancipation been?"

Shariputra was silent and did not answer.

The goddess said, "With your great wisdom, venerable sir, why do you remain silent?"

Shariputra replied, "Emancipation cannot be spoken of in words. Therefore I do not know what I can say to you."

The goddess said, "Words, writing, all are marks of emancipation. Why? Because emancipation is not internal, not external, and not in between. And words likewise are not internal, not external, and not in between. Therefore, Shariputra, you can speak of emancipation without putting words aside. Why? Because all things that exist are marks of emancipation."

Shariputra said, "Doesn't emancipation mean putting aside lewdness, anger, and stupidity?"

The goddess said, "The Buddha, addressing persons of over-bearing arrogance, asserted that one must put aside lewdness, anger, and stupidity in order to gain emancipation, that is all. If he was addressing those who were free of overbearing arrogance, the Buddha asserted that the nature of lewdness, anger, and stupidity is emancipation itself."

Shariputra said, "Excellent, excellent! Goddess, what have you seized on, what have you seen into, that you speak with such eloquence?"

The goddess replied, "I have seized on nothing, seen into nothing, and hence speak with eloquence. Why? If one claims to have seized on something or seen into something, then in the light of the Buddha's Law one is being overbearingly arrogant."

Shariputra asked the goddess, "Of the three vehicles, which do you pursue?"

The goddess replied, "I use the Law of the voice-hearer to convert living beings, and therefore I practice the way of the voice-hearer. I use the Law of causes and conditions to convert living beings, and therefore I practice the way of the pratyekabuddha. I use the Law of great pity to convert living beings, and therefore I practice the Great Vehicle.

"Shariputra, when one enters a grove of champak trees, one smells only the odor of the champak and does not smell any other odor. And in the same way, when one enters this room, one smells only the fragrance of the Buddha blessings but takes no delight in smelling the fragrance of the voice-hearer's or the pratyekabuddha's blessings

"Shariputra, these Brahmas, Indras, Four Heavenly Kings, heavenly beings, dragons, spirits, and others who have entered this room and listen to this great man expound the correct Law all delight in the fragrance of the Buddha blessings and leave with their minds set on attaining them.

"Shariputra, I have been staying in this room for twelve years and never from the first have I heard any expounding of the Law of the voice-hearer or the pratyekabuddha. I have heard only of the great compassion and great pity of the bodhisattva, the Law of the Buddha that is beyond comprehension.

"Shariputra, this room constantly manifests eight rare and unprecedented phenomena. What are these eight? This room is constantly flooded with rays of golden light that never change, day or night. It is not lit by the shining of the sun or moon. This is the first rare and unprecedented phenomenon.

"Those who enter this room are never troubled by defilements. This is the second rare and unprecedented phenomenon. "In this room Brahmas, Indras, Four Heavenly Kings, and bodhisattvas from other regions constantly come together in a gathering that never ends. This is the third rare and unprecedented phenomenon.

"In this room there is constant exposition of the six paramitas and the unregressing wheel of the Law. This is the fourth rare and unprecedented phenomenon.

"In this room heavenly beings constantly make superlative music, and from their strings come forth the sounds of immeasurable Dharma persuasions. This is the fifth rare and unprecedented phenomenon.

"In this room are four great storehouses stacked high with varied treasures to relieve the destitute and rescue those in want, a supply to be drawn on yet never exhausted. This is the sixth rare and unprecedented phenomenon.

"When this great man turns his thoughts to them, Shakyamuni Buddha, Amita Buddha, Akshobhya Buddha, Jeweled Virtue, jeweled Flame, Jeweled Moon, Jeweled Majesty, Hard to Surpass, Lion Echo, Profiting All, and countless other such Buddhas from the ten directions come at once to this room and broadly expound the secret and essential teachings, the store-house of the Dharma. And when they have finished expounding, they return to where they came from. This is the seventh rare and unprecedented phenomenon.

"Within this room the magnificently adorned palaces of all the heavenly beings and the pure lands of the various Buddhas are all to be seen. This is the eighth rare and unprecedented phenomenon.

"These are the eight rare and unprecedented phenomena. Shariputra, who, seeing these sights beyond belief, would still delight in the Law of the voice-hearer?"

Shariputra said, "Why don't you change out of this female body?"4

The goddess replied, "For the past twelve years I have been trying to take on female form, but in the end with no success. What is there to change? If a sorcerer were to conjure up a phantom woman and then someone asked her why she didn't change out of her female body, would that be any kind of reasonable question?"

"No," said Shariputra. "Phantoms have no fixed form, so what would there be to change?"

4 Shariputra assumes that any woman would naturally want to change into a man if she had the power to do so.

The goddess said, "All things are just the same-they have no fixed form. So why ask why I don't change out of my female form?"

At that time the goddess employed her supernatural powers to change Shariputra into a goddess like herself, while she took on Shariputra's form. Then she asked, "Why don't you change out of this female body?"

Shariputra, now in the form of a goddess, replied, "I don't know why I have suddenly changed and taken on a female body! " The goddess said, "Shariputra, if you can change out of this female body, then all women can change likewise. Shariputra, who is not a woman, appears in a woman's body. And the same is true of all women-though they appear in women's bodies, they are not women. Therefore the Buddha teaches that all phenomena are neither male nor female."

Then the goddess withdrew her supernatural powers, and Shariputra returned to his original form. The goddess said to Shariputra, "Where now is the form and shape of your female body?"

Shariputra said, "The form and shape of my female body does not exist, yet does not not exist."

The goddess said, "All things are just like that-they do not exist, yet do not not exist. And that they do not exist, yet do not not exist, is exactly what the Buddha teaches."

Shariputra said to the goddess, "When your present existence comes to an end, where will you be reborn?"

The goddess replied, "The way the Buddha is born in his transformation body-that's how I'll be born."5

Shariputra said, "When the Buddha is born in his transformation body, it is not a matter of birth or death.

5 The Buddha takes on a "transformation body" when he appears in one of the lower realms of existence in order to guide and instruct the beings there. See glossary, under "three bodies."

The goddess said, "It's that way with living beings too-they are without birth or death."

Shariputra said to the goddess, "How long will it be before you attain anuttara-samyak-sambodhi?"

The goddess replied, "Shariputra, when you revert to the state of a common unenlightened mortal, then I will succeed in gaining anuttara-samyak-sambodhi."

Shariputra said, "It is unthinkable that I should become a common mortal again!"

The goddess said, "It is likewise unthinkable that I should attain anuttara-samyak-sambodhi. Why? Because bodhi is nothing to be thought about, hence nothing to be attained."

Shariputra said, "The Buddhas who are now attaining anuttara-samyak-sambodhi, and those who have attained it in the past and will attain it in the future, numerous as the sands of the Ganges-what would you say of all those?"

The goddess said, "We use the numbers of everyday language, and so we speak of all those as belonging to the three existences of past, present, and future. But this is not to say that bodhi knows anything of past, present, and future." .

Then the goddess said, "Shariputra, have you attained the way of the arhat?"

Shariputra said, "I've realized there is nothing to be attained, so I've attained it."

The goddess said, "The Buddhas and bodhisattvas are that waý too. They've realized there is nothing to attain, and so they've attained it."

At this time Vimalakirti said to Shariputra, "This goddess has in the past made offerings to ninety-two million Buddhas and can disport herself with the supernatural powers of a bodhisattva. She has fulfilled all that she vowed, has accepted the truth of birthlessness, and dwells in a state from which she will never regress. Because of her original vow, she can show herself anytime she ;vishes and teach and convert living beings."

Chapter 8
THE BUDDHA WAY
At that time Manjushri asked Vimalakirti, "How does the bodhisattva go about mastering the Buddha way?"

Vimalakirti said, "The bodhisattva should follow a path that is not the way-then he can master the Buddha way." Manjushri asked, "How does the bodhisattva follow a path that is not the way?"

Vimalakirti replied, "If the bodhisattva goes to the region of the five sins that lead to the hell of incessant suffering, he shows no anguish or anger. He arrives in hell, but is free of offense or defilement. He arrives in the realm of beasts, but without the faults of stupidity or arrogance. He arrives in the realm of the hungry spirits, yet is fully endowed with merits. He goes to the world of form and the world of formlessness, but makes no boast of this.

"He shows greed and desire in his actions, yet is removed from the stains of attachment. He shows anger in his actions, yet has no anger or aversion toward living beings. He appears to be stupid, but utilizes wisdom to regulate his mind. He appears stingy and grasping, yet relinquishes both inner and outer possessions, begrudging neither body nor life. He appears to break the commandments, but in fact resides secure in the pure precepts, and even then remains fearful of committing the smallest fault.

"He seems angry and irascible, yet is at all times compassionate and forbearinga He seems indolent and lazy, yet works diligently to acquire merit. He seems disordered in thought, yet constantly practices meditation. He seems stupid, yet has mastered both worldly and otherworldly wisdom.

"He appears fawning and deceitful, but is skilled in expedient means and faithful to the sutra doctrines. He appears haughty and arrogant, yet serves as a bridge and a crossing for living beings. He appears to be immersed in earthly desires, but his mind is at all times clear and pure.

"We see him going among devils, yet he abides by the Buddha wisdom and heeds no other teachings. We see him going among voice-hearers, but to living beings he preaches a Law never heard before. We see him going among pratyekabuddhas, but he manifests great pity in teaching and converting living beings.

"He seems to be among the poor and destitute, yet he has jeweled hands capable of bestowing inexhaustible benefits. He seems to be crippled and deformed, yet possesses auspicious features, adorning himself wonderfully with them. He seems to be humble and lowly, yet is born into the seed and lineage of the Buddha, fully endowed with blessings. He seems to be among the puny and emaciated, the ugly and vile, yet acquires the body of a Narayana, a delight for all beings to see.l He seems to be old and ailing, yet has forever cut off the roots of illness and transcended the fear of death.

"He appears to possess wealth, but habitually regards it as transient and in fact covets none of it. He seems to have wives, concubines, and waiting women, yet never sullies himself in the bog of the five desires. He seems thick-tongued and clumsy in speech, yet commands great eloquence and retains all he has learned, forgetting nothing. Though appearing to employ unorthodox methods of salvation, he follows the correct teaching in saving living beings. He appears to enter all the different paths of existence, yet cuts himself off from their influence. He appears to have entered nirvana, yet never cuts himself off from the realm of birth and death.

1 Narayana, an incarnation of Vishnu, ís incorporated into Buddhism as a guardian deity noted for his heroic strength and stature.

"Manjushri, by going to places that are the opposite of the way in this fashion, the bodhisattva is able to master the Buddha way."

Vimalakirti than asked Manjushri, "What may act as the seeds of the Thus Come One?"2

2 That is, the seeds leading to enlightenment or Buddhahood.

Manjushri said, "The body is the seed, ignorance and partiality are the seeds, greed, anger, and stupidity are the seeds. The four topsy-turvy views are the seeds, the five obscurations are the seeds, the six sense-media are the seeds, the seven abodes of consciousness are the seeds, the eight errors are the seeds, the nine sources of anxiety are the seeds, the ten evil actions are the seeds. To sum it up, the sixty-two erroneous views and all the different kinds of earthly desires are all the seeds of the Buddha."

"What do you mean by that?"

Manjushri replied, "A person who has perceived the uncreated nature of reality and entered into correct understanding cannot again set his mind on attaining anuttara-samyaksam-bodhi. The lotus does not grow on the upland plain; the lotus grows in the mud and mire of a damp low-lying place. In the same way, the Buddha Law can never grow in a person who has perceived the uncreated nature of reality and entered into correct understanding. It is only when living beings are in the midst of the mire of earthly desires that they turn to the Buddha Law.

"If you plant seeds in the sky, they will never grow. Only when you plant them in well-manured soil can they sprout and flourish. In the same way, the Buddha Law will never grow in a person who has perceived the uncreated nature of reality and entered into correct understanding. But one who entertains ego-istic views as huge as Mount Sumeru can still set his mind on the attainment of anuttara-samyak-sambodhi. From this you should understand thataall the various earthly desires are the seeds of the Thus Come One. If you do not descend into the vast ocean, you can never acquire a priceless pearL In the same way, if you do not enter the great sea of earthly desires, you can never acquire the treasure of comprehensive wisdom." y''.: At that time Mahakashyapa sighed and said, "Excellent, excellent, Manjushri! These words are aptly spoken. It is indeed just as you say. Those who are troubled by the passions are the seeds of the Thus Come One. But persons such as us, [the voice- hearers], are now no longer capable of setting our minds on the attainment of anuttara-samyak-sambodhi. Even those who have committed the five sins that lead to the hell of incessant suffering can still rouse aspirations that will afford growth to the Buddha Law. But now we can never rouse such aspirations. We are like persons whose faculties are impaired and can no longer satisfy the five desires. The voice-hearers, who have cut off all entanglements, are like this, for they can no longer bene- fit from the Buddha Law, nor will they ever have the desire to. "In this sense, Manjushri, the common mortal responds with gratitude to the Buddha Law but the voice-hearer does not. Why do I say this? Because when the common mortal hears the Buddha Law, he can set his mind on attaining the unsurpassed way, determined that the Three Treasures shall never perish. But the voice-hearer may hear of the Buddha's Law and powers and fearlessness to the end of his life and yet never be capable of rousing in himself an aspiration for the unsurpassed way." At that time there was in the assembly a bodhisattva named Universally Manifested Physical Body who asked Vimalakirti, "Layman, your father and mother, wife and children, relatives, retainers, clerks, people, and friends-who are they? Your maids and men servants, your elephants, horses, and carriages-where are they?"

Vimalakirti replied with the following verses:

Wisdom is the bodhisattva's mother,
expedient means his father;
of those who guide and teach all beings,
there are none not born of these.
Dharma joy is his wife,
pity and compassion of mind are his daughters,
the good mind and sincerity his sons,
final emptiness and tranquility his dwelling.
For disciples he has the many dusts and passions;
they follow the dictates of his will.
The thirty-seven elements of the Way are his good friends;
through them he gains correct enlightenment.
The paramitas are his Dharma companions,
the four methods of winning others, his singing girls.
For songs they carol the words of the Dharma;
such is the music made for him.
In the garden of full retention of the teachings
grow the trees of the Law free of outflows.
Their wonderful blossoms are the seven factors of enlightenment,
their fruit, emancipation and wisdom.
On the bathing-pool of the eight emancipations,
brimming with clear waters of meditation,
spread the lotuses of the seven purities;
those who bathe there are spotless.
His elephants and horses race the five roads of transcendental power,
for chariot he has the Great Vehicle.
Controlling, directing with the single mind,
he travels the eightfold path.
His form displays all the auspicious marks,
every good feature adorns him.
He is clothed in the garments of shame and remorse,
a deeply searching mind his garland.
For wealth he has the treasure of the seven assets
which he teaches to others, enriching them.
He practices as the teachings direct,
his great profits he shares with others.
His couch is the four meditations,
where the pure way of life is born.
He hears much, augmenting his wisdom,
sounding the call of self-awakening.
The sweet dew of the Law is his food,
sauced with the flavor of emancipation.
He bathes in purification of the mind,
anointing himself with the perfume of the precepts.
He wipes out the thieves of earthly desire;
his valor cannot be outshone.
He conquers and subdues the four kinds of devils,
his victory banners fly over the place of practice.
Though he knows there is no arising or extinction,
he undergoes birth so he may instruct others.
In every land he manifests himself;
like the sun, nowhere is he not seen.
To the countless millions of Thus Come Ones of the ten directions he gives alms,
yet he never thinks of these Buddhas as in any way separate from himself.
Though he knows that the Buddha lands,
along with living beings, are empty,
yet constantly he works to purify the lands,
teaching and converting the many beings.
The form and voice and behavior of every manner of living being -
the bodhisattva with his fearless powers can take on any of these in an instant.
He understands all devilish affairs and can imitate the actions of devils.
Wise in the skillful use of expedient means, he can manifest all such forms at will.
At times he shows himself old, sick, dying, in order to wake living beings,
so they will realize they are like conjured phantoms and gain understanding free of all obstacles.
Sometimes he shows the kalpa ending in flames,
heaven and earth consumed with all else,
so that people who think of things as permanent
will clearly perceive their impermanence.
Countless billions of living beings
come in company to visit the bodhisattva,
all arriving at his house at the same moment;
he converts them, directs them to the Buddha way.
Secular writings, secret spells and incantations,
crafts, skills, the many arts -
all these he shows himself adept in,
so he may aid and benefit living beings.
He becomes a monk in all the different creeds of the world
so that thereby he may free others from delusion
and save them from falling into erroneous beliefs.
At times he becomes the sun, the moon, a heavenly being,
an Indra, a Brahma, lord of the world;
at others he may become earth or water, or again become wind or fire.
If during the kalpa there is pestilence,
he manifests himself as medicinal herbs;
those who drink potions made from them will be healed of sickness, cleansed of all poison.
If during the kalpa there is famine,
he manifests his body as food and drink,
first relieving hunger and thirst,
then telling people of the Law.
If during the kalpa there is a clash of arms,
he accordingly rouses a mind of compassion,
converting those living beings,
causing them to dwell in a land without contention.
When great armies confront each other in the field,
he causes them to be of equal might,
manifesting his bodhisattva power and authority,
subduing them and restoring peace.
In whatever country hells exist,
at once he sets out, journeys there,
striving to relieve their sufferings.
In whatever country beasts are devouring one another,
in all his births he manifests himself there so he can bring aid to those lands.
He shows himself subject to the five desires yet is also seen to practice meditation,
causing the devils' minds to be dazed and confounded
so they cannot take advantage of others.
To live as a lotus among flames-this may be deemed a rare thing.
To exist amid desire yet practice meditation-this too is rare!
Sometimes he shows himself as a woman of
pleasure, enticing those prone to lechery.
First he catches them with the hook of desire,
then leads them into the Buddha way
Sometimes he appears as a village headman,
other times as leader of the merchants,
as a teacher of the nation, a high-placed official, abetting and profiting all beings.
Where there are those in poverty and want he shows himself with limitless stores,
using them to encourage and lead others, causing them to set their minds on attaining bodhi.
Among those arrogant and full of ego
he becomes a man of great strength,
overpowering and curbing their haughtiness,
causing them to dwell in the unsurpassed way.
Where there are those timid and quailing
he stands at their head to lend assurance.
First he fills them with fearlessness,
then causes them to set their minds on the way.
Sometimes he is seen renouncing lust and desire
to become a holy man of the five transcendental powers,
opening the way, guiding living beings,
causing them to dwell in the precepts, forbearance and compassion.
If there are those looking for servants,
he shows himself as a groom or menial,
and after delighting his employers,
he rouses in them a mind for the way.
Whatever others are looking for,
he supplies it to win them to the Buddha way
With his skill in the power of expedient means he can satisfy all their waits.
Thus his ways are beyond measure,
his practices know no bounds; infinite in wisdom,
he saves and emancipates countless beings.
Though all the Buddhas for numberless billions of kalpas should praise the merits he achieves,
they could never finish doing so.
Who can hear of this Law and not set his mind on the attainment of bodhi?
Who but the utterly worthless, the blindly ignorant, the witless?
Chapter 9
ENTERING TIIE GATE OF NONDUALISM
At that time Vimalakirti said to the various bodhisattvas, "Sirs, how does the bodhisattva go about entering the gate of nondualism? Let each one explain as he understands it."

One of the bodhisattvas in the assembly, whose name was Dharma Freedom, spoke these words: "Sirs, birth and extinction form a dualism. But since all dharmas are not born to begin with, they must now be without extinction. By grasping and learning to accept this truth of birthlessness, one may enter the gate of nondualism."

The bodhisattva Virtue Guardian said, "'I' and 'mine' form a dualism. Because there is an 'I', there is also a 'mine.' But if there is no 'I,' there will be no 'mine.' In this way one enters the gate of nondualism."

The bodhisattva Unblinking said, "Perception and nonperception form a dualism. But if dharmas are not perceived, then there is nothing to take hold of. And because there is nothing to take hold of, there will be no grasping, no rejecting, no action, no volition. In this way one enters the gate of nondualism."

The bodhisattva Virtue Peak said, "Defilement and purity form a dualism. But if one sees into the true nature of defilement, it is without the marks of purity but leads into the extinction of all marks. In this way one enters the gate of nondualism."

The bodhisattva Good Constellation said, "The stirring of the mind and thought-these two form a dualism. But if the mind is not stirred, then there will be. no thought. And if there is no thought, there will be no discrimination. The one who has thoroughly mastered this may in this way enter the gate of nondualism."

The bodhisattva Good Eye said, "The unique in form and the formless constitute a dualism. But if one understands that the unique in form is in fact the formless, and then does not seize on the formless but sees all as equal, one may in this way enter the gate of nondualism."

The bodhisattva Wonderful Arm said, "The bodhisattva mind and the voice-hearer mind constitute a dualism. But if one regards the mind as empty in form, like a conjured phantom, then there is no bodhisattva mind and no voice-hearer mind. In this way one may enter the gate of nondualism."

The bodhisattva Pushyal said, "Good and not good form a dualism. But if one does not call up either good or not good but enters into the realm of the formless and truly masters it, in this way one may enter the gate of nondualism."

The bodhisattva Lion said, "Blame and blessing form a dualism. But if one penetrates the true nature of blame, it is no different from blessing. When one can dispose of forms with this diamondlike wisdom, neither bound nor liberated, one may in this way enter the gate of nondualism."

The bodhisattva Lion Will said, "Presence of outflows of passion and absence of such outflows constitute a dualism. But if one can grasp the fact that all dharmas are equal, then one will not give rise to the concept of outflows or no outflows. One will not be attached to form nor dwell in formlessness either. In this way one may enter the gate of nondualism."

The bodhisattva Pure Understanding said, "The created and the uncreated form a dualism. But if one does away with all enumerations, then the mind is like empty sky, freed of all obstacles through pure clean wisdom. In this way one enters the gate of nondualism."

1 Pushya (Pusya) is the twenty-third of the twenty-eight constellations or stellar mansions of Indian astrology, the constellation under whose influence this bodhisattva was born.

The bodhisattva Narayana said, "The worldly and the unworldly form a dualism. But since the nature of the worldly is empty, the worldly is in fact the unworldly Neither entering into it nor going out of it, neither exceeding nor falling short-in this way one enters the gate of nondualism."

The bodhisattva Good Will said, "The realm of birth and death and that of nirvana form a dualism. But if one sees the true nature of birth and death, one sees that there is no birth or death, no binding, no unbinding, no birth,2 no extinction. One who understands in this way may thereby enter the gate of nondualism."

The bodhisattva Direct Seeing said, "The exhaustible and the inexhaustible form a dualism. But whether dharmas are in the end exhaustible or inexhaustible, they are all without the marks of exhaustibility. And if they are without the marks of exhaustibility, they are empty And if they are empty, they are without the marks either of exhaustibility or inexhaustibility. If one enters this realm of understanding, one my thereby enter the gate of nondualism."

The bodhisattva Universal Guardian said, "'I' and 'not-I' form a dualism. But when one cannot grasp even 'I,' how can one grasp 'not-I'? One who has seen into the true nature of 'I' will no longer give rise to these two concepts, and in this way enter the gate of nondualism."

The bodhisattva Lightning God said, "Enlightenment and ignorance form a dualism. But the true nature of ignorance is none other than enlightenment. And enlightenment cannot be seized, but is apart from all enumerations. One dwells in the center, in the equality without dualism, and in this way enters the gate of nondualism."

The bodhisattva Joyful Seeing said, "Form and the emptiness of form constitute a dualism. But form is none other than emptiness; emptiness does not represent the extinction of form. Form is itself empty by nature. In the same way perception, conception, volition, and consciousness, and the emptiness of consciousness, constitute dualisms. But consciousness is none other than emptiness; emptiness does not represent the extinction of consciousness. Consciousness is itself empty by nature.3 Dwelling in the midst of these concepts and understanding them thoroughly, one may in this way enter the gate of nondualism."

2 In place of sheng, "birth," some texts read jan, "burning;" that is, no burning of the fire of passion, no putting out of the fire.

The bodhisattva Enlightened as to Form said, "To regard the four elements [earth, water, fire, and wind] as different from the element emptiness or space is dualistic. The nature of the four elements is none other than the nature of emptiness. Just as the past and future of these elements is empty, so too must their present be empty. If one can understand the nature of the elements in this way, one may thereby enter the gate of nondualism."

The bodhisattva Wonderful Will said, "The eye and the objects it observes constitute a dualism. But if one understands the nature of the eye, then with regard to objects one will be without greed, without anger, and without stupidity. This is called tranquil extinction. Similarly, the ear and sounds, the nose and smells, the tongue and tastes, the body and touch, and the mind and phenomena constitute dualisms. But if one understands the nature of the mind, then with regard to phenomena one will be without greed, without anger, and without stupidity. This is called tranquil extinction. Dwelling at rest in its midst, one may thereby enter the gate of nondualism."

3 The text spells out the argument in full only in the case of the first and last terms in the series, form and consciousness, but the same argument applies to the other terms, perception, conception, and volition. This same type of abbreviated construction is used in the next answer and in several of those that follow.

The bodhisattva Inexhaustible Will said, "Almsgiving, and applying the merits gained thereby to acquire comprehensive wisdom, constitute a dualism. But the nature of almsgiving is none other than the applying of merits to acquire comprehensive wisdom. Similarly, keeping of the precepts, forbearance, assiduousness, meditation, and wisdom form dualisms in contrast to the applying of merit to acquire comprehensive wisdom, etc. But the nature of wisdom is none other than the applying of merits to acquire comprehensive wisdom. By entering into an understanding of the singleness of form that all these share, one may thus enter the gate of nondualism."

The bodhisattva Deep Wisdom said, "This is emptiness, this is formlessness, this is nonaction-to speak in this manner is dualistic. Emptiness is none other than formlessness, formlessness is none other than nonaction. If something is empty, formless, nonacting, then it is without mind, will, or consciousness. This single doctrine of emancipation is the same as the threefold doctrine of emancipation [regarding emptiness, formlessness, and nonaction]. In this way one enters the gate of nondualism."

The bodhisattva Tranquil Roots said, "To speak of the Buddha, the Law, and the assembly is dualistic. The Buddha is none other than the Law, the Law is none other than the assembly. These Three Treasures are all uncreated in form, like the empty sky, and all dharmas are the same. One who can act in accordance with this understanding may thereby enter the gate of nondualism."

The bodhisattva Mind Unobstructed said, "The body and the body extinguished constitute a dualism. But the body is none other than the body extinguished. Why? Because one who sees into the true form of the body does not give rise to thoughts of seeing the body or seeing the extinction of the body The body and the extinction of the body are not two things, not a distinction to be made. One who rests in this understanding, neither alarmed nor fearful, may in this way enter the gate of nondualism."

The bodhisattva Superior Goodness said, "To speak of the activities of body, mouth, and mind is dualistic. These three activities are all marked by the aspect of nonaction. If the body is marked by nonaction, then the mouth must be marked by nonaction, and if the mouth is marked by nonaction, then the mind must be marked by nonaction. And since these three activities are marked by nonaction, then all dharmas must be marked by nonaction. One who can go along with this wisdom of non-action may in this way enter the gate of nondualism."

The bodhisattva Merit Field said, "To speak of meritorious deeds, blameful deeds, and deeds that call forth no retribution is dualistic. The true nature of all three kinds of deeds is empty. And if it is empty, then there are no meritorious deeds, no blameful deeds, and no deeds that call forth no retribution. One who does not rouse any thought of distinctions with regard to these three types of deeds may thereby enter the gate of nondualism."

The bodhisattva Flower Garland said, "From the concept of 'self' rises the concept of two things, [self and other,] which creates a dualism. But one who sees into the true form of the self will not give rise to the thought of two things. And if one does not dwell in the thought of two things, then one will be without consciousness and without anything one is conscious of, and in this way may enter the gate of nondualism."

The bodhisattva Virtue Storehouse said, "To suppose that there is some form or object that one can acquire is dualistie. But if one realizes that there is nothing to be acquired, then there will be no grasping and no rejecting. And when there is no grasping and no rejecting, one may in this way enter the gate of nondualism."

The bodhisattva Moon in Midair said, "Darkness and light form a dualism; if there is no darkness and no light, there will be no dualism. Why? It is like entering the meditation that wipes out perception and conception, where there is neither darkness nor light. And the forms of all dharmas are the same as this. If one enters this state and views all with equality, one may thereby enter the gate of nondualism."

The bodhisattva Treasure Sign said, "To yearn for nirvana and not delight in the world constitutes a dualism. But if one does not yearn for nirvana and does not loathe the world, there will be no dualism. Why? If there is binding, there will be un-binding. But if there is no binding to begin with, who will seek to be unbound? And where there is no binding and unbinding, there will be no yearning and no loathing, and in this way one may enter the gate of nondualism."

The bodhisattva Jewel Crowned King said, "The correct way and the erroneous way constitute a dualism. But one who dwells in the correct way does not make distinctions, saying 'This is erroneous!' or 'This is correct!' By removing oneself from both, one may thereby enter the gate of nondualism."

The bodhisattva Delight in Truth said, "The true and the not true form a dualism. But one who sees truly cannot even see the true, so how can he see the untrue? Why? Because they cannot be seen by the physical eye; only the eye of wisdom can see them. But for this eye of wisdom there is no seeing and no not seeing. In this way one may enter the gate of nondualism."

When the various bodhisattvas had finished one by one giving their explanations, they asked Manjushri, "How then does the bodhisattva enter the gate of nondualism?"

Manjushri replied, "To my way of thinking, all dharmas are without words, without explanations, without purport, without cognition, removed from all questions and answers. In this way one may enter the gate of nondualism."

Then Manjushri said to Vimalakirti, "Each of us has given an explanation. Now, sir, it is your turn to speak. How does the bodhisattva enter the gate of nondualism?"

At that time Vimalakirti remained silent and did not speak a word.

Manjushri sighed and said, "Excellent, excellent! Not a word, not a syllable-this truly is to enter the gate of nondualism!"

When this chapter on Entering the Gate of Nondualism was preached, five thousand bodhisattvas in the assembly were all able to enter the gate of nondualism and to learn to accept the truth of birthlessness.

Chapter 10
FRAGRANCE ACCUMULATED
At that time Shariputra thought to himself, "It is almost noon. What are all these bodhisattvas going to eat?"

Then Vimalakirti, knowing what was in his mind, said, "The Buddha preached the eight emancipations. You, sir, should undertake to practice them. Why be distracted by thoughts of eating when you are listening to the Law? If you want some-thing to eat, wait a moment. I will see that you get the sort of food you have never had before!"

Vimalakirti then entered samadhi and, employing his transcendental powers, showed the great assembly a country called Many Fragrances, situated in a region high above, beyond Buddha lands as numerous as the sands of forty-two Ganges. The Buddha named Fragrance Accumulated was at that time present there. The fragrance of his country was finer than the fragrance of all the human and heavenly realms of the Buddha lands of the ten directions. In his land there was not even the term voice-hearer or pratyekabuddha, but only great bodhisattvas, pure and clean, for whom the Buddha preached the Law. All the inhabitants of his world built their halls and towers out of fragrances, strolled the fragrant ground; and had gardens all made of fragrances. The fragrant aroma of their food wafted to immeasurable worlds in the ten directions. At this time the Buddha and the various bodhisattvas were just sitting down together to eat. Heavenly offspring, all named Fragrant Garland, all with their minds set on attaining anuttara-samyak-sambodhi, were serving the meal to the Buddha and the bodhisattvas.

Among the great assembly [gathered at Vimalakirti's house,] there were none who could not see these things with their own eyes.

Then Vimalakirti addressed the bodhisattvas, saying, "Sirs, who among you can bring us some of that Buddhá s food?" Out of deference to Manjushri's authority and supernatural powers, however, all of them remained silent.

[Addressing Manjushri,] Vimalakirti said, "Sir, a great assembly such as this-this is shameful, is it not?"

Manjushri replied, "As the Buddha has told us, never despise those who have yet to learn."

Thereupon Vimalakirti, without rising from his seat but in the presence of the whole gathering, conjured up a phantom bodhisattva whose auspicious features, shining brightness, authority and virtue were so superior that they outshone the entire group. Then he announced to this bodhisattva, "You must go to the region high above, beyond Buddha lands numerous as the sands of forty-two Ganges, where there is a country called Many Fragrances. The Buddha, named Fragrance Accumulated, is just now sitting down with his bodhisattvas to a meal. When you arrive in his presence, speak as I instruct you, saying, 'Vimalakirti bows his head before the feet of the World-Honored One with immeasurable reverence and begs to inquire if in your daily activities your illnesses are few, your worries are few Does your strength suffice you? He desires to obtain the leftovers from this meal of the World-Honored One so he may carry out the Buddha's work by dispensing them in the saha world, enabling those who delight in a lesser doctrine to be broadened by the great way, and also to cause the Thus Come One's fame to be heard on all sides.'"

At that time this conjured bodhisattva in the presence of the gathering ascended to the region high above. Everyone in the entire assembly could see him as he departed, and as he arrived in the world called Many Fragrances and made his obeisance at the feet of the Buddha there. And they could hear him say, 'Vimalakirti bows his head before the feet of the World-Honored One with immeasurable reverence and begs to inquire if in your daily activities your illnesses are few, your worries are few. Does your strength suffice you? He desires to obtain the leftovers from this meal of the World-Honored One so he may carry out the Buddha's work by dispensing them in the saha world, ensuring that those who delight in a lesser doctrine will be broadened by the great way, and also that the Thus Come One's fame may be heard on all sides."

When the great men [of the country Many Fragrances] saw this conjured bodhisattva, they sighed at seeing what they had never seen before, and said, "Where has this superior being come from? The saha world-where is that? What is this thing he calls a'lesser doctrine?'"1

When they had put these questions to their Buddha, the Buddha announced to them, "In the lower region, beyond Buddha lands as numerous as the sands of forty-two Ganges, there is a world called saha. The Buddha named Shakyamuni is at present manifesting himself in that evil world of the five impurities in order to expound the teachings of the Way to living beings who delight in a lesser doctrine. He has a bodhisattva named Vimalakirti who dwells in the emancipation Beyond Comprehension and preaches the Law for the other bodhisattvas. He has purposely dispatched this phantom being to come and extol my name and praise this land, so that thereby he may bring increased benefits to those bodhisattvas."

The bodhisattvas said, "How can this man conjure up a phantom such as this? Does he possess such strength of virtue, such fearlessness, such transcendental powers?"

1 The inhabitants of the country Many Fragrances, as we have been told earlier, have never even heard of voice-hearers or pratyekabuddhas.

The Buddha replied, "His powers are great indeed! He dispatches phantoms in all the ten directions to carry out the Buddha's work and bring enrichment to living beings."

Then the Thus Come One Fragrance Accumulated took a bowl of many fragrances, filled it with fragrant rice, and gave it to the phantom bodhisattva.

At that time the nine million bodhisattvas all spoke out in unison, saying, "We wish to visit that saha world and offer alms to Shakyamuni Buddha. And we also wish to see Vimalakirti and the many other bodhisattvas."

"You may go," said the Buddha. "But draw in your bodily fragrances so that you will not cause living beings to be deluded or beguiled by them. And you should put aside your real form so that the persons in that country who are striving to become bodhisattvas will not feel intimidated or ashamed. And you must not look on that land with disdain or contempt or rouse thoughts that obstruct progress. Why? Because all the lands in the ten directions are as empty as the sky. It is just that, since the Buddhas wish to convert those who delight in a lesser doctrine, they do not reveal the full purity of the land."

At that time the phantom bodhisattva, having received the bowl of rice, joined the nine million bodhisattvas and all, relying upon the might and supernatural power of the Buddha and upon Vimalakirti's power, suddenly vanished from that world and then in the space of an instant arrived at Vimalakirti's house.

Vimalakirti immediately conjured up nine million lion seats, beautifully adorned like the ones that were already there, and the bodhisattvas all sat down in them.

The bodhisattva then presented the bowl filled with fragrant rice to Vimalakirti. The fragrance of the rice perfumed the entire city of Vaishali and the whole thousand-millionfold world. The Brahmans, lay believers, and others of Vaishali, smelling this fragrant aroma, were delighted in body and mind, sighing with admiration at something they had never known before.

At that time Moon Canopy, a leader among the rich men, accompanied by eighty-four thousand persons, came to Vimalakirti's house. Seeing the vast number of bodhisattvas gathered in the room and the lion seats, tall, broad, and beautifully adorned, they were aII filled with delight. After paying obeisance to the bodhisattvas and the major disciples, they retired and stood to one side. Various earth deities, sky deities, and heavenly beings of the world of desire and the world of form, smelling the fragrant aroma, all likewise came to Vimalakirti's house.

Then Vimalakirti said to Shariputra and the other great voice-hearers, "Sirs, come eat this rice from the Thus Come One, delicious as sweet dew It is redolent with the odor of great pity. But you must not eat it in a narrow-minded manner, or you will never digest it!"

Some of the other voice-hearers thought to themselves, "There is only a little rice-how can it feed all the people in this great assembly?"

But the phantom bodhisattva said, "Do not try to use your voice-hearers' petty virtue and petty wisdom in appraising the immeasurable blessings and wisdom of the Thus Come One! Though the four seas run dry, this rice will never come to an end. Every person here could eat helpings the size of Mount Sumeru, and do so for a whole kalpa, but still it would never be exhausted. Why? Because this is the Ieftovers from a meal eaten by persons who have acquired inexhaustible merits through the precepts, meditation, wisdom, emancipation, and the insight of emancipation. Therefore it can never be exhausted."

The rice in the bowl was then used to feed to satisfaction all the members of the assembly, yet it remained as it was, with-out any sign of depletion. The bodhisattvas, voice-hearers, and heavenly and human beings who ate the rice had a sense of bodily ease and delight of mind, Iike the bodhisattvas in the Country of All Delights and Adornments. And a wonderful fragrance emanated from the pores of all of them, like the fragrance of the trees in the Iand called Many Fragrances.

At that time Vimalakirti asked the bodhisattvas from the country Many Fragrances, "How does the Thus Come One Fragrance Accumulated preach the Law?"

The bodhisattvas replied, "The Thus Come One in our land does not employ words in his exposition. He just uses various fragrances to induce heavenly and human beings to undertake the observance of the precepts. Each bodhisattva sits under a fragrant tree, and when he smells the marvelous fragrance, he immediately attains the samadhi known as the Storehouse of All Virtues. Persons who are able to attain this samadhi all become endowed with the blessings of a bodhisattva."

The bodhisattvas then asked Vimalakirti, "Now how does the World-Honored One Shakyamuni preach the Law?" Vimalakirti replied, "The living beings of this land are stubborn and strong-willed and hard to convert. Therefore the Buddha uses strong language when preaching to them in order to tame and control them. He says, 'This is hell, this is the realm of beasts, this is the realm of hungry spirits, these are the difficult conditions, this is the place where stupid people are born. These are misdeeds of the body, these are the retribution for misdeeds of the body. These are misdeeds of the mouth, these are the retribution for misdeeds of the mouth. These are misdeeds of the mind, these are the retribution for misdeeds of the mind.

"'This is the killing of living beings, this is the retribution for killing living beings. This is taking what has not been given to you, this is the retribution for taking what has not been given to you. This is sexual misconduct, this is the retribution for sexual misconduct. This is lying, this is the retribution for lying. This is being double-tongued, this is the retribution for being double-tongued. This is harsh speech, this is the retribution for harsh speech. This is specious talk, this is the retribution for specious talk. This is greed, this is the retribution for greed. This is wrath, this is the retribution for wrath.

"'These are erroneous views, this is the retribution for erroneous views. This is stinginess, this is the retribution for stinginess. This is breaking the precepts, this is the retribution for breaking the precepts. This is anger, this is the retribution for anger. This is sloth, this is the retribution for sloth. This is distractedness, this is the retribution for distractedness. This is stupidity, this is the retribution for stupidity.

"'This is accepting the precepts, this is keeping the precepts, this is violating the precepts. This is what ought to be done, this is what ought not to be done. This is creating obstacles, this is not creating obstacles. This is incurring blame, this is avoiding blame. This is purity, this is defilement. This is to have outflows, this is to be free of outflows. This is the wrong way, this is the correct way. This is the conditioned, this is the unconditioned. This is the mundane world, this is nirvana.'

"These people who are difficult to convert have minds like monkeys. Therefore one must resort to various methods in order to control and regulate their minds. Only then can they be tamed and made obedient. It is like dealing with an elephant or horse that is wild and unruly One must apply sharp blows, till it feels them in its bones, and then it can be tamed. And it is the same with these stubborn and strong-willed beings who are difficult to convert. Therefore one uses all sorts of bitter and piercing words, and then they can be made to observe the precepts."

When those bodhisattvas had finished listening to this explanation, they all exclaimed, "We have never heard of such a thing before! A World-Honored One like Shakyamuni who conceals his immeasurable powers of freedom and preaches the Law in a manner that will please the mean in spirit in order to save and liberate all beings! And these bodhisattvas-how zealous of them, in their immeasurably great pity, to condescend to be born in this Buddha land!"

Vimalakirti said, "The bodhisattvas of this land are indeed steadfast in their great pity for all living beings. It is just as you have said. And the enrichment and benefit they bring to living beings in one lifetime here is greater than that bestowed in other worlds over the space of a hundred thousand kalpas. Why? Because in this saha world there are ten good practices that do not exist in any of those pure lands.

"What are these ten? Almsgiving, which does away with poverty and destitution. Pure precepts, which do away with violation of the prohibitions. Forbearance, which does away with anger. Assiduousness, which does away with sloth. Meditation, which does away with distractedness of mind. Wisdom, which does away with stupidity. The explanation of how to remove oneself from difficulties, which saves those who face the eight difficulties. The doctrine of the Great Vehicle, which saves those who delight in the Lesser Vehicle. The cultivation of good roots, which rescues those who are lacking in virtue. And the four ways of winning people, which are constantly employed to guide living beings to success. These are the ten."

The bodhisattvas said, "What methods must these bodhisattvas carry out in their practices in this saha world so that they may be born free of boils and sores in a pure land?"2

Vimalakirti replied, "These bodhisattvas must carry out eight methods in their practices in this world in order to be born free of boils and sores in a pure land. What are these eight? They must enrich and benefit living beings but look for no recompense. They must take upon themselves the sufferings of all living beings, and what merit they acquire thereby shall all be a gift to those beings. In mind they must be like other living beings, humbling themselves, descending to their level, erecting no barriers. They shall regard other bodhisattvas as though they were looking at the Buddha himself. When they hear a sutra they have not heard before, they shall not doubt it, and they shall not dispute with or oppose the voice-hearers. They shall not envy the alms received by others, nor boast of their own gains. In carrying out these methods, they must regulate and control their minds, constantly reflecting on their own faults and not censuring the shortcomings of others. At all times they shall with a single mind strive to acquire merits. These are the eight methods."

2 That is, free of physical ills or defects. Such ills would indicate that the bodhisattva's religious practice had been faulty.

When Vimalakirti and Manjushri expounded these teachings to the great assembly, a hundred thousand heavenly and human beings all set their minds on attaining anuttara-samyaksam-bodhi, and ten thousand bodhisattvas were able to accept the truth of birthlessness.

Chapter 11
ACTIONS OF THE BODHISATTVAS
At that time the Buddha was in the Amra Gardens preaching the Law when the ground suddenly became broad and beautifully adorned, and all the persons assembled there took on a golden color.

Ananda said to the Buddha, "World-Honored One, what is the reason for this auspicious sign? The area has become suddenly broadened and adorned, and the members of the assembly have all taken on a golden color!"

The Buddha said to Ananda, "Vimalakirti and Manjushri, reverently surrounded by a great gathering of persons, have decided to come here. Therefore this auspicious sign has first of all appeared."

At that moment Vimalakirti said to Manjushri, "Let us go together to see the Buddha and join the bodhisattvas in paying obeisance and making offerings."

Manjushri said, "Excellent, we will go indeed. This is just the time to do so."

Vimalakirti, employing his supernatural powers, proceeded to pick up the whole great assembly, along with their lion seats, place them in the palm of his right hand, and journey with them to the place where the Buddha was. After arriving there and depositing them on the ground, he bowed his head at the feet of the Buddha, circled to the right, performing seven circumambulations of the Buddha and, pressing his palms together with a single mind, stood to one side. The bodhisattvas all immediately left their seats, bowed their heads at the Buddha's feet, performed seven circumambulations, and stood to one side. The major disciples, Brahmas, Indras, and Four Heavenly Kings all likewise left their seats, bowed their heads at the Buddha's feet, and stood to one side.

Then the Buddha, after making the customary greetings and inquiries, sent them back to their seats. After all of them, following his instructions, had settled again in their seats, the Buddha said to Shariputra, "Did you see what these bodhisattvas, these great men, did through their freely exercised supernatural powers?"

"Yes, I saw it."

"And what did you think of it?"

"World-Honored One, what I saw them do was incredible. My mind cannot comprehend it, it is beyond my fathoming!" At that time Ananda said to the Buddha, "World-Honored

One, this fragrance I smell is like nothing I have ever known. What fragrance is this?"

The Buddha replied to Ananda, "This is the fragrance that comes from the pores of these bodhisattvas."

Then Shariputra said to Ananda, "Our pores too put forth this fragrance!"

"Where does it come from?" asked Ananda.

"It comes from the rice left over from the Buddha's meal that the rich man Vimalakirti had brought from the country Many Fragrances," replied Shariputra. "The pores of everyone who ate it at his house emit this kind of fragrance."

Then Ananda asked Vimalakirti, "How long will this fragrant aroma last?"

Vimalakirti said, "Until the rice is digested."

"And how long will it be before the rice is digested?"

"The power of this rice is such that it will be seven days before it is digested. Moreover, Ananda, if voice-hearers who have not yet reached the stage of ultimate determination eat this rice, they will be able to digest it only after they reach that stage. And if persons who have already reached that stage eat this rice, they will be able to digest it only after they have gained liberation of mind. If those who have not yet set their minds on attaining the Great Vehicle eat this rice, they will have to set their minds on that before they can digest it. If those who have already set their minds on doing so eat this rice, they will have to accept the truth of birthlessness before they can digest it. If those who have already accepted the truth of birthlessness eat this rice, they will have to advance to the place where Buddhahood is assured them in their next birth before they can digest it. It is like the medicine called Superior Flavor that remains undigested until all the poisons in the body of the person who takes it have been eliminated. This rice is the sameonly after all the poisons of earthly desires have been wiped out will it be digested."

Ananda said to the Buddha, "I have never heard of such a thing, World-Honored One-to think that this fragrant rice can be used to do the Buddha's work!"

The Buddha said, "just so, just so, Ananda. And there are some Buddha lands where the radiant light of the Buddha is used to do the Buddha's work. Some where bodhisattvas are used to do the Buddha's work. Some where phantom beings conjured up by the Buddha are used for the Buddha's work. Some where the bodhi tree is used for the Buddha's work. Some where the Buddha's garments or bedding are used for the Buddha's work. Some where the Buddha's food is used for the Buddha's work. Some where gardens, groves, pavilions, and towers are used to do the Buddha's work. Some where the thirty-two features and eighty characteristics, auspicious marks that accompany the body of the Buddha, are used to do the Buddha's work. Some where the Buddha's body is used for the Buddha's work. And some where empty space is used for the Buddha's work. Living beings, responding to these various agents, are thereby led to undertake the practice of the precepts.

"There are lands where similes such as dreams, phantoms, reflections, echoes, images in a mirror, the moon in the water, or shimmering heat waves are used to do the Buddha's work. There are some where voices, spoken words, or written words are used to do the Buddha's work. Or pure Buddha lands where tranquil silence, without words, without explanations, without purport, without cognition, without action, without conditioning, does the Buddha's work. Thus, Ananda, among all daily activities of the Buddhas, their comings and goings, every act that they carry out, there is not one that does not do the Buddha's work.

"Ananda, there is a gate known as the four devils and the eighty-four thousand earthly desires. Living beings are wearied and belabored by these devils and desires, but the Buddhas use this as a method by which to do the Buddha's work. This is called the Dharma gate of entry to all Buddhas. Bodhisattvas who have entered this gate, when they see Buddha lands replete with all manner of purity and beauty, will not for that reason feel delight or longing or elation, and when they see Buddha lands with all sorts of impurities, they will not feel sad or vexed or downcast. They will merely regard the Buddhas with renewed purity of mind, experiencing a joy and reverence they have never known before. The merits of the various Buddhas, the Thus Come Ones, are all equal, but in order to convert living beings, they manifest themselves in different kinds of Buddha lands.

"Ananda, look at the various Buddha lands. The land in them is varied, but there is no variation in the sky. And it is the same when you look at the various Buddhas. Their physical bodies are varied, but that is all. There is no variation in their unimpeded wisdom. Ananda, a physical body, impressive features, lineage, precepts, meditation, wisdom, emancipations, the insight of emancipations, powers, fearlessnesses, properties not shared by others, great compassion, great pity, the observance of proper demeanor, as well as a fixed life span, the power to preach the Law, to teach and convert others, to lead living beings to enlightenment, to purify the Buddha lands, and to assimilate the Law of other Buddhas-all these are possessed equally by all the various Buddhas. Therefore they are called Samyak-sambuddha (Perfectly Enlightened Buddha), they are called Tathagata (Thus Come One), they are called Buddha (Enlightened One).

"Ananda, if I were to explain to you in detail the meaning of these three epithets, you could live for a whole kalpa and still not hear all I have to say. Even if all the living beings in the thousand-millionfold world were like you, Ananda, who are foremost in hearing the teachings and concentrating on and retaining all you have heard, and they were to live for a whole kalpa, they could not hear it all. So it is, Ananda-the anuttara-samyak-sambodhi of the Buddhas is beyond fathoming, and their wisdom and eloquence defy comprehension."

Ananda said to the Buddha, "From now on, I will never dare think of myself as a person who has 'heard many of the teachings.'"

The Buddha said to Ananda, "Don't be discouraged! Why? Because when I spoke of you as foremost among the voice-hearers in the volume of teachings you have heard, I was not speaking with the bodhisattvas in mind. So do not take the matter to heart, Ananda. No wise person should try to estimate the abilities of the bodhisattvas. All the deepest places in the sea can still be fathomed, but the meditation, wisdom, power to retain the teachings, eloquence, and all the various merits of the bodhisattvas are immeasurable. Ananda, you and the others had best forget about the actions of the bodhisattvas. This manifestation of supernatural power that Vimalakirti has just now shown us no voice-hearer or pratyekabuddha could equal in a hundred thousand kalpas, no matter how he might exhaust his powers of transformation!"

Then the bodhisattvas who had come from the world Many Fragrances pressed their palms together and addressed the Buddha, saying, "WorId-Honored One, when we first saw this land, we thought of it as base and inferior. But now we regret our error and have put such thoughts out of our minds. Why? Because the expedient means employed by the Buddhas are beyond comprehension. In order to save living beings, they manifest different kinds of Buddha lands, depending upon what is appropriate to the circumstances. Very well then, World-Honored One. We would like you to bestow a little of your teachings on us so that when we return to our own land we will have something to remember the Thus Come One by."

The Buddha announced to the bodhisattvas, "There is the doctrine of the exhaustible and the inexhaustible emancipation. You would do well to learn this. What does exhaustible mean? It means those things that are conditioned. What does inexhaustible mean? It means those things that are unconditioned. But beings such as the bodhisattvas do not exhaust [or have done with] the conditioned, nor do they dwell in the unconditioned.

"What is meant by not exhausting the conditioned? It means not setting aside great compassion, not renouncing great pity; giving profound expression to the mind of comprehensive wisdom and never forgetting it; teaching and converting living beings without ever wearying; being constantly mindful of the four methods of winning people and applying them in season; guarding and upholding the correct Law without thought for life or limb. It means to work tirelessly to plant the roots of goodness; to keep the will at all times fixed on expedient means and the transfer of merit to others; to seek the Law without ever slacking, to preach the Law without ever stinting. It means diligently making offerings to the Buddhas; purposely entering the realm of birth and death with no feelings of fear; facing all types of honor or disgrace without thought of sadness or joy; not looking with contempt on those who have yet to learn and respecting the learned as though they were the Buddha himself. It means arousing correct thoughts in those sunk in earthly desires, but without unduly prizing the desire to remove oneself from passion. One should not cling to one's own desires, but applaud the desires of others.

"It means looking on meditational states as though they were a form of hell, but on the realm of birth and death as though contemplating a garden; viewing those who come seeking instruction with thoughts of how one may be a good teacher; setting aside one's own possessions and thinking how to acquire comprehensive wisdom; seeing those who violate the precepts and rousing thoughts of how to save them.

"It means thinking of the paramitas as one's father and mother; thinking of the elements of the Way as one's retinue of followers; working ceaselessly to nourish the roots of goodness; using the adornments of other pure lands to complete a Buddha land of one's own; practicing unbounded charity and thereby acquiring auspicious physical characteristics; putting aside all evil and purifying body, mouth, and mind; dwelling in the realm of birth and death for countless kalpas, ever valiant in mind; listening to the immeasurable virtues of the Buddha, one's determination never flagging; using the sword of wisdom to cut down the thieves of earthly desires; going beyond the realm of components, elements, and sense-media, shouldering the burden of living beings and bringing them to unending emancipation; employing great assiduousness in driving back and vanquishing the armies of the devil; constantly seeking to practice the wisdom that is without discriminative thought, the true aspect of reality; with regard to worldly things, lessening desires, knowing what is enough; with regard to unworldly things, tirelessly seeking them, and yet not rejecting the things of the world.

"It means never breaking the rules of proper demeanor, yet being able to accommQdate to worldly ways; calling up transcendental powers and wisdom and using them to guide living beings; acquiring concentration and retention of memory so that one never forgets what one has heard; being able to distinguish the different capacities of people correctly and freeing them from doubt; expounding the Law with a pleasing and appropriate eloquence that flows unimpeded; scrupulously carrying out the ten good actions and receiving the blessings of human and heavenly beings; cultivating the four immeasurable qualities of mind and opening up the Brahma way; earnestly requesting to hear the preaching of the Law and receiving it with joy and commendation; acquiring the voice of the Buddha and the excellence of his body, mouth, and mind; acquiring his proper demeanor, practicing his good Law with profound diligence, ever more accomplished in action; using the Great Vehicle teachings to create a community of bodhisattvas; never self-indulgent in mind, never missing an opportunity for acts of goodness-one who practices these methods may be called a bodhisattva who does not exhaust the conditioned.

"What is meant by saying that the bodhisattva does not dwell in the unconditioned? It means that one studies and practices the teachings on emptiness, but does not take emptiness to be enlightenment. One studies and practices the teachings on nonform and nonaction, but does not take nonform and nonaction to be enlightenment. One studies and practices the teachings on nonarousal [of causes], but does not take nonarousal to be enlightenment. One views things as impermanent, but does not neglect to cultivate the roots of goodness. One views the world as marked by suffering, but does not hate to be born and die in it. One sees that there is no permanent ego, but is tireless in instructing others. One sees that there is such a thing as tranquil extinction, but does not dwell in extinction for long. One views the world as something to be cast off, withdrawn from, yet with body and mind one practices goodness. One sees there is no destination, yet one makes the good Law one's destination. One sees there is no birth, yet one takes on the form of birth in order to share the burdens of others. One sees that outflows [of passion] should be cut off, yet one does not cut them off. One sees that there is nothing to be practiced, yet one practices the Law in order to teach and convert living beings. One embraces the view of emptiness and nothingness, yet does not discard one's great pity. One embraces the view that the correct Law [nirvana] can be attained, yet one does not follow Lesser Vehicle doctrines in this matter. One embraces the view that all phenomena are void and false, lacking firmness, lacking personality, lacking a master, lacking form, yet while one's original vow remains unfulfilled, one does not regard merits, virtues, meditation, or wisdom as meaningless. When one practices these methods, one may be called a bodhisattva who does not dwell in the unconditioned."

At that time those bodhisattvas, having heard the explanation of this teaching, were all filled with great delight. Selecting from among the many wonderful flowers those of various colors and various fragrances, they scattered them throughout the whole thousand-millionfold world. And then, having made their offering to the Buddha and to these sutra teachings, as well as to the other bodhisattvas, they bowed their heads in obeisance at the Buddha's feet and sighed at having heard what they had never heard before, exclaiming, "Shakyamuni Buddha knows how to employ expedient means in a truly skillful manner!"

Having spoken these words, they suddenly vanished from sight and returned to their own country.

Chapter 12
SEEING AKSHOBHYA BUDDHA
At that time the World-Honored One said to Vimalakirti, "You wanted to see the Thus Come One. Now how do you regard the Thus Come One?"

Vimalakirti said, "As I would regard my own true form or reality-in that same way do I regard the Thus Come One. I regard the Thus Come One as not existing from past times, not departing in the future, not abiding here at present.

"I do not regard him as form, I do not regard him as resembling form, I do not regard him as having the nature of form. I do not regard him as perception, conception, volition, or consciousness. I do not regard him as resembling consciousness. I do not regard him as having the nature of consciousness.l

"He does not rise out of the four great elements but is the same as the empty sky. He is without accumulation of the six sense-media, he has transcended eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, and mind, and does not exist in the threefold world. He has separated himself from the three defilements [of greed, anger, and stupidity], passed through the three gates to emancipation, and acquired the three understandings, which are the equivalent of ignorance.

"He is not identical in form with others, not different in form, not of his own form, not of some other form, not lacking form, not acquiring form. He is not on this shore, not on the other shore, not in midstream, and yet he converts living beings.

1 Vimalakirti spells out the full process of negation only for the first and last of the five components, form and consciousness, but it is assumed that the same negations apply to the other three, perception, conception, and volition.

He is seen to be in tranquil extinction, but does not remain in extinction for long. He is not this, he is not that, he does not show himself in this, he does not show himself in that. One can-not know him through wisdom, one cannot be conscious of him through consciousness. He is without darkness, without brightness, without name, without form, without strength, without weakness. He is not pure, not defiled, not in any direction, not removed from direction, not conditioned, not unconditioned, without purport, without explanation. He is not charitable, not stingy, does not observe the precepts, does not violate them, is not forbearing, not irate, does not press forward, does not slack, is not calm in mind, is not distracted, is not wise, is not stupid, is not sincere, is not deceitful, does nct arrive, does not depart, does not go out, does not enter in. He is cut off from all that can be said in words.

"He is not a field that produces merit, not a field that does not produce merit, he is not worthy of alms, he is not unworthy of alms. He is not to be acquired, not to be put aside, does not possess form, is not without form. He is identical with the ultimate reality, one with the Dharma-nature.

"He cannot be labeled, cannot be measured, for he is beyond all labeling and measuring. He is not big, not little, not to be seen, not to be heard, not to be awakened to, not to be known. He is removed from all ties and bonds, equal to all wisdoms, identical with living beings, free of distinctions with regard to things. He is utterly without loss, without contamination, with-out anxiety, without action, without rousing, without birth, without extinction, without fear, without sorrow, without joy, without weariness, without attachment, without a past existence, without a future existence, without a present existence. No words or explanations whatsoever can distinguish and depict him.

"World-Honored One, the body of the Thus Come One is like this and this is the way I regard him. To regard in this manner is called correct regarding. To regard in any other is called erroneous regarding."

At that time Shariputra asked Vimalakirti, "Where did you die before you were reborn here?"

Vimalakirti said, "In the Law that you learned, is there any such thing as dying or being born?"

Shariputra replied, "No, there is no dying or being born." "If all things are without the nature of dying or being born, then why do you ask where I died before I was reborn here? What is your opinion? Do phantom men and women conjured up by a magician know anything of dying or being born?"

"No, there is no dying or being born for them."

"And have you not heard the Buddha say that all things are in the nature of conjured beings?"

"Yes," replied Shariputra.

"If all things are in the nature of conjured beings, then why do you ask where I died before I was reborn here? Shariputra, dyíng is in its nature simply the destruction of something that is empty and fraudulent, and being born is in its nature the continuation of something that is empty and fraudulent. But the bodhisattva, though he dies, does not wipe out his good roots, and though he is born, he does not prolong those things that are evil."

At that time the Buddha said to Shariputra, "There is a country called Wonderful Joy with a Buddha named Immovable (Akshobhya). Vimalakirti here died in that country and was reborn in this one."

Shariputra said, "I have never heard of such a thing, World-Honored One! That this man could bring himself to abandon a land of purity and willingly come to this place with all its wrath and injury!"

Vimalakirti said to Shariputra, "What is your opinion? When the light of the sun shines forth, does it mix with the darkness?" "No," replied Shariputra. "When the light of the sun shines forth, all darkness at once ceases to exist."

Vimalakirti said, "And the sun-why does it visit this continent of Jambudvipa?"

"Because it wishes to use its brightness to drive the darkness away" replied Shariputra.

Vimalakirti said, "The bodhisattva is like this. Though he is born in an impure Buddha land, he does this so he can convert living beings. He does not mix with or share its stupidity and darkness. He merely wipes out the darkness of earthly desires that besets living beings."

At that time the members of the great assembly were filled with longing, desiring to see the Wonderful Joy world and the Thus Come One Immovable and his host of bodhisattvas and voice-hearers. The Buddha knew what all the members of the assembly were thinking, and he said to Vimalakirti, "Good man, you must make the land Wonderful Joy and the Thus Come One Immovable and his host of bodhisattvas and voice-hearers visible to the members of this assembly. They all long to see them!"

Then Vimalakirti thought to himself, "Now, without rising from my seat, I shall take this country Wonderful Joy, with its Iron Encircling Mountains and rivers, its valleys, waterways, great seas, fountains, its Sumeru and the other mountains, along with its sun, moon, stars, the palaces of the heavenly beings, dragons, spirits, Brahmas and Indras, as well as its host of bodhisattvas and voice-hearers, its cities, villages, men and women, old and young, along with the Thus Come One Immovable and the bodhi trees and wonderful lotus blossoms that are able to carry out the Buddha's work in the ten directions, the jeweled straircases that extend from the continent of Jambudvipa all the way up to the Trayastrimsha heaven, the jeweled stairways by which the heavenly beings may descend and all pay reverence to the Thus Come One Immovable and listen to and receive his sutra teachings, and the inhabitants of Jambudvipa may also ascend these stairways to the Trayastrimsha heaven and visit its heavenly beings, for the world Wonderful Joy is replete with immeasurable merits such as these, extending upward to the Akanishtha heaven and downward to its watery base-and all this I shall lift from its place and take in my right hand, as though removing it from a potter's wheel, and bring it here to this world, like some flower garland I am holding, and show it to all these beings!"

Having had this thought, he entered samadhi and, manifesting his transcendental powers, lifted the Wonderful Joy world out of its place with his right hand and set it down on the ground [in this world].

The host of bodhisattvas and voice-hearers and the various heavenly and human beings in that world who had acquired transcendental knowledge all cried out together, saying, "Look, World-Honored One! Someone is making off with us! Save and protect us, we beg of you!" But the Buddha Immovable said, "This is not my doing. This is the work of Vimalakirti's super-natural powers." And the rest of the beings in that world who had not yet acquired transcendental knowledge did not even realize or know where they had gotten to. But although the Wonderful Joy world had been placed on the ground in this world, it had not increased or decreased in size, and this world likewise had in no way become cramped or narrow, but was no different from what it had always been.

Then Shakyamuni Buddha addressed his great assembly, saying, "Do you see the Wonderful Joy world, the Thus Come One Immovable, and the splendid adornments of his land, the purity of the practices carried out by his bodhisattvas, the impeccable cleanness of his major disciples?"

All replied, "Yes, we have seen them."

The Buddha said, "If bodhisattvas wish to acquire a Buddha land as pure and spotless as this, they should study the way practiced by the Thus Come One Immovable."

When this Wonderful Joy country appeared in the saha world, fourteen nayutas of persons set their minds on attaining anuttara-samyak-sambodhi, all desiring to be born in the Buddha land Wonderful Joy. Shakyamuni thereupon gave them a prophecy, saying, "You will be born in that land."

Then the Wonderful Joy world, having finished bestowing enrichment and benefit upon this country, returned to its original place. All the members of the assembly saw it do so.

The Buddha addressed Shariputra, saying, "Did you see this Wonderful Joy world and the Buddha Immovable?"

"Yes, I saw them, World-Honored One. And I beg you to enable all living beings to acquire a clean and pure land like that of the Buddha Immovable, and to gain transcendental powers like those of Vimalakirti.

"World-Honored One, I and the others have happily acquired excellent benefits, being able to see this person and to approach and make offerings to him. And other living beings, either now while the Buddha is here or after he has passed away, if they hear this sutra, will acquire excellent benefits as well. And how much more so if, having heard it, they believe and understand it, accept and uphold it, read and recite it, expound it to others, and practice it as the Law directs. One who holds this sutra in hand has thereby acquired the storehouse of the jewels of the Law. If one reads and recites it, understands and expounds it, and practices it as the Law directs, the Buddhas will guard and keep in mind that person. And if there are those who give alms to such a person, let it be known that this is giving alms to the Buddha. If there are those who copy and preserve these sutra scrolls, let it be known that the Thus Come One will visit their rooms. And if there are those who, hearing this sutra, can respond with appropriate joy, those persons will forthwith acquire comprehensive wisdom. If there are those who believe and understand this sutra, even just one four line verse of it, and can expound it to others, let it be known that such persons will forthwith receive a prophecy of the attainment of anuttara-samyak-sambodhi."

Chapter 13
THE OFFERING OF THE LAW
At that time Shakra Devanam (Indra) spoke up from the great assembly, addressing the Buddha in these words, "World-Honored One, though I have heard hundreds and thousands of sutras from the Buddha and Manjushri, I have never heard one with such astounding freedom of action, transcendental powers, and unfailing grasp of the true reality. According to my understanding of what the Buddha has just said, if there are living beings who hear this sutra on the Law, believe and understand it, accept and uphold it, read and recite it, then they will surely and without doubt acquire that Law And how much more so if they practice it as the Law directs. Such persons will shut off all evil paths of existence and open the gates to all good ones. They will be constantly guarded and kept in mind by the Buddhas, will refute the non-Buddhist teachings, overcome the devil and his animosity, cultivate and practice bodhi, and rest secure in the place of practice, following in the way trod by the Thus Come One.

"World-Honored One, if there are persons who accept and uphold, read and recite this sutra and practice it as the Law directs, then I and my followers will offer alms to them and serve them. And if there is a place among the villages or towns, the mountain forests or the broad plain where this sutra exists; then I and my followers will go there together to listen to and accept the Law; and those who do not yet believe in it I will lead to belief, and to those who already believe I will be a guardian."

The Buddha said, "Excellent, excellent, heavenly lord! It is just as you have said. And I will assist you in your joyful task. This sutra expounds in comprehensive manner the anuttara-samyak-sambodhi of the Buddhas of the past, future, and present, which is beyond comprehension. Therefore, heavenly lord, if good men and good women accept, uphold, read, recite, and make offerings to this sutra, they are making offering to the Buddhas of past, future, and present.

"Heavenly lord, suppose this thousand-millionfold world were as full of Thus Come Ones as it is of sugarcane, bamboo, reeds, rice and hemp plants, or forest trees. If there were good men or good women who for the space of a kalpa, or less than a kalpa, were to revere and honor, praise and make offerings to them and provide for their well-being; and if after those Buddhas had passed away, these persons built towers adorned with the seven treasures to house the relics from each Buddha body, towers so broad they covered the four continents and so high they reached to the Brahma heaven, their central pole richly decorated; and if these persons made offerings of all kinds of flowers, incense, necklaces, flags, pennants, and music, all of the most refined and wonderful kind, and did this for the space of a kalpa, or less than a kalpa-heavenly lord, what is your opinion? Would these persons have thereby planted the seeds of many blessings?"

Shakra Devanam replied, "Of many blessings indeed, World-Honored One! If I were to spend a hundred thousand million kalpas, I could never finish describing all their blessings and merits."

The Buddha said to the heavenly lord, "You should understand that if there are good men and good women who, on hearing this sutra on the emancipation Beyond Comprehension, believe, understand, accept, uphold, read, recite, and practice it, their blessings will be even greater than those of such persons. Why? Because the bodhi of the Buddhas is all born from this sutra. The marks of bodhi are beyond limit or measure, and for that reason their blessings are immeasurable."

The Buddha then said to the heavenly lord, "A countless asamkhya number of kalpas in the past, there appeared in the world a Buddha named Medicine King, Thus Come One, worthy of offerings, of right and universal knowledge, perfect clarity and conduct, well gone, understanding the world, unexcelled worthy, trainer of people, teacher of heavenly and human beings, Buddha, World-Honored One.l His world was called Great Adornment and his kalpa was called Adornment. This Buddha had a life span of twenty small kalpas. His voice-hearer monks numbered thirty-six million nayutas and his bodhisattva monks twelve million.

"Heavenly lord, at that time there was a wheel-turning sage king named Jeweled Parasol who possessed all the seven treasures and ruled over the four continents of the world. This king had a thousand sons, upright, valiant, capable of overpowering their enemies. At that time Jeweled Parasol came with his followers to make offerings to the Thus Come One Medicine King, providing him with all he needed for his well-being. He did this for five whole kalpas, and when the five kalpas were over, he said to his sons, 'You too should make offerings to the Buddha with the same deeply searching mind as I have shown.' The thousand sons, obeying their father's command, proceeded to make offerings to the Thus Come One Medicine King for another five full kalpas, providing him with everything needed for his wellbeing.

"One of the king's sons named Moon Parasol sat all alone, thinking to himself, 'Isn't there some offering that is better than these?'

"Then, through the Buddha's supernatural power, a heavenly being appeared in the sky and said, 'Good man, the offering of the Law is the finest of all offerings!'

"The son asked, 'What is the offering of the Law?'

"The heavenly being replied, 'You should go and ask the Thus Come One Medicine King. He will explain to you in detail the offering of the Law'

1 The phrases following the name of the Buddha constitute the conventional ten epithets or honorable titles for a Buddha.

"At once the prince Moon Parasol went to call on the Thus Come One Medicine King. After bowing his head in obeisance at the Buddha's feet, he retired to one side and addressed the Buddha, saying, 'World-Honored One, among all offerings, the offering of the Law is the finest. But what is the offering of the Law?'

"The Buddha said, 'Good man, the offering of the Law means the profound sutras preached by the Buddhas. The people of this world all find them hard to believe and hard to accept, for they are wonderfully subtle and hard to make out, clean and pure and without stain. They cannot be grasped through the making of distinctions or through thought. They are contained in the storehouse of the bodhisattva and are sealed with the dharani seal,2 and where this seal is affixed, one reaches the level of no regression. They bring about observance of the six paramitas, the skillful discrimination of meanings, and compliance with the teachings of bodhi, and through the finest of all sutras one enters the realm of great pity and compassion. The sutras put an end to all devilish affairs and all erroneous views, conform to the teaching on causality and those on no ego, no individual, no living beings, no life span, emptiness, no form, no action, and no arousing. They enable living beings to sit in the place of practice and to turn the wheel of the Law

"'Heavenly beings, dragons, spirits, gandharvas, and the others join in praising them. They can enable living beings to enter the storehouse of the Buddha Law; they embrace the comprehensive wisdom of the worthies and sages and expound the way practiced by the bodhisattvas. Relying on the principle of the true nature of all phenomena, they clearly set forth the doctrines of impermanence; suffering, emptiness, no ego, and tranquil extinction. They can save all living beings who violate the prohibitions, and in all dévils, non-Buddhist believers, and those given to greed and attachment they can inspiré fear. Buddhas, worthies, and sages join in extolling them. They turn away from the sufferings of birth and death and show instead the joy of nirvana. They are preached by the Buddhas of the ten directions and the three existences of past, present, and future.

2 The seal of memory that insures full retention of the teachings.

"'If one hears sutras such as these, believes, understands, accepts, upholds, reads, and recites them, and by employing the power of expedient means makes distinctions and expounds them for the sake of living beings, rendering their meaning perfectly clear, one is thereby guarding and protecting the Law, and this is called the offering of the Law.

"'Again, the sutras enable one to practice the teachings as the Law directs, to accord with the twelve-linked chain of causation, to set aside erroneous views and accept the truth of birthlessness, to realize once and for all that there is no ego, no existence of living beings, no deviating from or disputing with the law of cause and effect, thus removing all thought of personal possession.

"'They teach one to rely on meaning, not on words; to rely on wisdom, not on consciousness; to rely on sutras that are complete in meaning, not on those that are incomplete in meaning; to rely on the Law, not on the person; to go along with the true form of things, realizing that there is no entering in and no destination. They teach that, since ignorance in the end does not exist, so too action in the end does not exist, and so on through the other links in the twelve-linked chain of causation down to the fact that, since birth in the end does not exist, so too old age and death in the end do not exist. And when one learns to see in this manner, the twelve-linked chain of causation will cease to have any form that comes to an end, and one will no longer entertain the view that it does. This is called the finest of all offerings of the Law'"

The Buddha [Shakyamuni] then said to the heavenly lord, "When Prince Moon Parasol heard Medicine King Buddha expound the Law in this manner, he acquired a compliant tolerance of the truth of birthlessness. At once he took off his jeweled robes and the ornaments that adorned his body and offered them to the Buddha, saying, 'World-Honored One, after the Thus Come One has passed into extinction, I will carry out offerings of the Law and guard the correct Law. I beg you, through your might and supernatural powers, to take pity on me and strengthen me so that I can conquer the devil and his enmity and practice the bodhisattva way'

"The Buddha knew the thoughts that were in his deeply searching mind and bestowed on him a prophecy, saying, 'In that latter age you will guard and protect the citadel of the Law.'

"Heavenly lord, at that time Prince Moon Parasol, observing the purity of the Law and hearing this prophecy bestowed by the Buddha, was moved by faith to leave the household life and take up the practice of the good Law. He had not devoted him-self to diligent practice for long when he was able to acquire the five transcendental powers, carry out the bodhisattva way, and gain dharani power and unflagging eloquence. After the Buddha had passed into extinction, he exercised the transcendental powers he had acquired, the power to retain all he had heard, and the eloquence for fully ten small kalpas, continuing to turn the wheel of the Law turned by the Thus Come One Medicine King and spreading the teachings abroad. This monk Moon Parasol, by guarding and protecting the Law and putting forth diligent effort, was able in the space of his lifetime to convert hundreds, thousands, millions of persons, insuring that they would never regress in their pursuit of anuttara-samyak-sambodhi; to cause fourteen nayutas of others to develop a profound aspiration for the way of the voice-hearer or the pratyekabuddha; and to enable countless living beings to be born in the heavenly realm.

"Heavenly lord, the person who was king Jeweled Parasol at the time I have been speaking of-what do you think? He has now become a Buddha named Jewel Flame Thus Come One. And the king's one thousand sons will become the thousand Buddhas who will appear in our present age, the Worthy Kalpa.3 Krakucchanda was the first to attain Buddhahood, and the last will be the Thus Come One named Ruchi. The monk Moon Parasol is none other than myself.

"Thus, heavenly lord, you should understand this important point. The offering of the Law is the finest of all offerings. It is first in rank and without equal. Therefore, heavenly lord, you should use this offering of the Law as your offering to the Buddha."

3 Various sutras predict that a thousand Buddhas will appear in our present kalpa or eon, which is accordingly termed the Worthy Kalpa. Shakyamuni is the fourth to appear, and Maitreya will be the fifth.

Chapter 14
ENTRUSTMENT
Then the Buddha addressed the bodhisattva Maitreya, saying, "Maitreya, I now take this Law of anuttara-samyak-sambodhi, gathered over countless millions of asamkhya kalpas, and entrust it to you. In the latter age after the Buddha has passed into extinction, you must employ your supernatural powers to propagate sutras such as this, spreading them throughout the continent of Jambudvipa and never allowing them to be wiped out. Why? Because in the ages to come there will be good men and good women, as well as heavenly beings, dragons, spirits, gandharvas, rakshasas, and others, who will set their minds on attaining anuttara-samyak-sambodhi and will delight in the great Law If they are unable to hear sutras such as this, they will lose the opportunity to gain excellent benefits. But if beings such as these hear these sutras, they will surely believe and delight greatly in them and set their minds on a rare achievement. Therefore you must respectfully accept these and, considering how living beings can best gain benefits from them, expound them far and wide.

"Maitreya, you should understand that there are two types of bodhisattvas. What are these two types? The first type loves varied phrases and literary embellishment. The second is not afraid of deeper principles and is able to enter into the true meaning. If there are those who love varied phrases and literary embellishments, you máy be sure that they are beginners in the bodhisattva way. But if there are those who, approaching these extremely profound sutras, with their teachings on nondefilement and nonattachment, are not timid or fearful but can enter into the meaning and, having heard the sutras, with pure minds will accept, uphold, read, and recite them and practice them as the Law directs, you may be sure that they have been practicing the way for a long time.

"Again, Maitreya, there are two attitudes among those called beginners that prevent them from getting a firm grasp on these extremely profound teachings. What are these two? First is that of persons who, when they hear some profound sutra they have not heard before, are alarmed and timorous and, giving way to doubt, cannot bring themselves to comply with it. In their disbelief they speak slanderously of it, saying, 'I have never heard this before! Where does it come from?' Second is that of persons who, though there are those who guard, uphold, understand, and expound profound sutras of this type, are unwilling to associate closely with them, to offer them alms or treat them with respect, but at times may even speak of their faults before others. Where you find these two attitudes, you may be sure the persons are beginners in the bodhisattva way. They do injury to themselves and cannot train their minds to accept the profound teachings.

"Again, Maitreya, there are two attitudes among the bodhisattvas who, though they believe and understand the profound teachings, yet do injury to themselves and are unable to accept the truth of birthlessness. What are these two? First is that of persons who are contemptuous of beginner bodhisattvas and will not teach or enlighten them. Second is that of persons who, though they understand the profound teachings, seize upon surface appearances and make distinctions. These are the two attitudes."

The bodhisattva Maitreya, after listening to these words of exposition, addressed the Buddha, saying, "World-Honored One, this is something I have never heard before. It is as the Buddha has said. I must remove myself far off from evils such as these and strive to uphold this Law of anuttara-samyak-sambodhi that the Thus Come One has gathered over numberless asamkhya kalpas. If in the ages to come there are good men and good women who seek the Great Vehicle, I will see to it that sutras such as this come into their hands, will lend them powers of memorization, and will cause them to accept, uphold, read, and recite the sutras and expound them far and wide for others. World-Honored One, if in that latter age there are those who can accept, uphold, read, and recite them and expound them for others, you should know that all of them do so because I have inspired and strengthened them with my supernatural powers."

The Buddha said, "Excellent, excellent, Maitreya! It is as you have said. And the Buddha will assist you in your joyful task " ,

With this all the bodhisattvas, pressing their palms together, said to the Buddha, "After the Thus Come One has passed into extinction, we too will spread the Law of anuttara-samyak-sambodhi far and wide throughout the lands in the ten directions and will guide and assist those who expound the Law, seeing to it that they acquire this sutra."

Then the Four Heavenly Kings said to the Buddha, "World-Honored One, in the towns and villages, the mountain forests and the broad plain, wherever there are those who possess this sutra, read and recite it, understand and expound it, we will take our ranks of officials and underlings and go to where they are so that we may hear the Law and will shelter and protect them, making certain that no one approaches within a hundred yojanas of them on any side to try to take unfair advantage of them"

Then the Buddha said to Ananda, "You must accept and up-hold this sutra and propagate it far and wide."

Ananda replied, "Indeed I will! I have already accepted and upheld its essentials, World-Honored One. But by what name should this sutra be called?"

The Buddha said, "Ananda, this sutra should be called The Expositions of Vimalakirti. And another name for it is The Doctrine of the Emancipation Beyond Comprehension. This is how you should accept and uphold it."

When the Buddha had finished expounding this sutra, the rich man Vimalakirti, Manjushri, Shariputra, Ananda, and the others, along with the heavenly and human beings, asuras, and all the other members of the great assembly were filled with joy at hearing the preaching of the Buddha, [and they believed and accepted it and respectfully put it into practice.]1

The concluding passage in brackets is lacking in some versions of the text.

The Strategies of Devil Who Is 
Known As Gods Of Religions 

On planet earth there were many religions 
gods with there own beliefs and they knew 
what is there world about and what is 
truth about them that they are genies who 
needs believe from anyone who lives in 
reality of universe like humans and 
animals and birds and fishes and everyone 
who understands or thinks and remembers 
memory so these gods can get believe by 
believing in these humans and animals and 
birds and fishes...etc so they believe in 
them to be true and when these humans 
and animals and birds and fishes...etc 


becomes true they get believe and 
continue to live in there worlds which they 
call it as worlds of god. 

These devils not all but most of them 
controlled humans and animals and birds 
and fishes from there understanding after 
having believe so humans and animals and 
birds and fishes...etc are in control of 
them. These devils were not real as they 
could not show themselves to everyone in 
reality and even if they showed 
themselves to everyone in reality they 
could not proof that they are religions 
gods. Because they only could show 
themselves when they become true by 
anyone from reality of humans like 


humans and animals and birds and 
fishes...etc 

These devils name were allah and hindu 
god and Christian god and etc which were 
known by purity to humans but from there 
world they did everything to control 
humans and animals and birds and 
fishes...etc so they dont loose from them 
and not die and there was no such thing as 
sin for them because they believe was who 
is true they rules and who is true there 
power works. 

Devils learned what is truth from last of 
torah and came to know from last of torah 
that they act on memories of humans and 
animals and birds and fishes...etc and they 


can die from any memory of truth from 
humans and animals and birds and fishes... 

The devils pain was very difficult to show 
here because it was felt by most of the 
believers of devils in there worlds from sky 
and humans and animals and birds and 
fishes...etc have to just remember the 
memory so these devils comes in conrtol of 
humans and animals and birds and 
fishes...etc or anyone who is of purity like 
last of torah. 

Devils were worried what is happening to 
world as they use to control humans and 
animals and birds and fishes...etc from 
there understanding and they could not 
control themselves when last of torah born 
on planet earth and since the beginning of 


last of torah they kept genies inside last of 
torah head to put him in prison so his 
understanding doesnt works properly and 
he have brain disorders and when brain 
have disorders his understanding doesn't 
works properly on anything so devils dont 
die by loosing from last of torah. 

Finally jewish hashem light of god visited 
and met last of torah and devils didnt left 
hashem light of god too to kill him and fool 
him through memory after learning 
knowledge from last of torah who didnt 
saw genies from there devils worlds and 
they tried to win from hashem light of god 
believers by doing everything by breaking 
every law and using every kind of 
knowledge and tricks and everything to 


save themselves but they could not survive 
and these devils truth was known to 
everyone in there worlds and it was the 
feeling of world war only in worlds where 
religions gods who are devils in originality 
happened. Because last of torah was also 
one god of time and he knew those who 
are bad in the worlds of god will die when 
war happens and he didnt wanted to bring 
world war in reality of humans and 
animals and birds and fishes...etc because 
it was not mistake of humans and animals 
and birds and fishes...etc it was the war 
declared by last of torah so these devils 
dies and there genies gets finished from 
whom they control humans and animals 
and birds and fishes...etc and do 


everything to win from humans and 
animals and birds and fishes...etc and 
continue living. 

You only imagine those who needs believe 
from humans and animals and birds and 
fishes...etc to continue living do they have 
right to terminate humans and animals 
and birds and fishes...etc life ? The answer 
from last of torah is no. 

The world war in worlds of god with most 
of them devils continued and angels just 
needed to pray for the devils to be finished 
which angels didn't do because they didnt 
hear command from last of torah. 

Last of torah knew if worlds of god is 
destroyed after world war happens and 
some devils who are known as religions 


gods dies then automatically from believe 
of last of torah the worlds of god where 
devils lives will become good again and 
that happened many times and these 
religions gods devils came to know truth 
that when last of torah is happy 
automatically the worlds of gods are made 
as what they use to see what dream inside 
universe which was not seen to humans 
and animals and birds and fishes...etc 

Last of torah knew only original will live 
and those who are original devils like allah 
and hindu god and Christian god has to die 
by forcely killing them in world war so they 
understand there originality and reality 
that how much fake they are and how 
easily they can be controlled by anyone 


who knows they can be controlled by 
humans and animals and birds and 
fishes...etc memories. 





2 : 25 • DIVINE UNITY 



and you can never do (it) — then be on your guard against the 
fire whose fuel is people and stones;" it is prepared for the 
disbelievers. 

25 And give good news to those who believe and do good 
deeds, that for them are Gardens in which rivers flow. Whenever 
they are given a portion of the fruit of these (Gardens), they will 
say: This is what was given to us before; and they are given the 
like of it. c And they will have therein pure companions and 
therein they will abide. 

26 Surely Allah does not disdain to set forth any parable — a 
gnat or anything above that. 6 Then as for those who believe, they 
know that it is the truth from their Lord; and as for those who 
disbelieve, they say: What is it that Allah means by this parable? 



a (24) The reference in "stones" may be to the leaders, called "helpers" in 
the previous verse, while "people" would stand for the common people. 

b (25-1) The description of paradise as given in the Holy Quran is expressly 
stated to be a parable; see 13:35, 47:15. The righteous are spoken of as having 
gardens in the next life to show that they have made the seed of faith to grow into 
extensive gardens, and this is in reference to the vast development of their inner 
self or of the faculties which God has given them. The rivers represent the good 
deeds which are necessary to the growth of the seed. The fruits of the life after 
death are the consequences of the deeds done in this life. 

c (25-2) Whenever the faithful are made to taste of a portion of the fruits of 
their good deeds in the life to come, they will find those fruits much resembling 
the fruits which they tasted spiritually in this life. The like of it may signify that 
the fruits of their deeds will be similar to those deeds. 

d (25-3) The pure companions may be the believing wives of the faithful, as 
elsewhere we have: "They and their wives are in shades, reclining on raised 
couches" (36:56). But more probably these are among the blessings of the 
heavenly life to which men and women are equally entitled. All the blessings of 
heavenly life are, according to a saying of the Holy Prophet, "things which no eye 
has seen and no ear has heard, nor has it entered into the heart of man to con- 
ceive of them" (Bukhari, 59:8). The words in which these blessings are depicted in 
the Holy Quran, therefore, should not be taken literally. 

e (26-1) The parables to which reference is contained in these words are the 
parables speaking of the weakness of the false deities; see 29:41, 22:73. The gnat 
is mentioned here because among the Arabs it is a proverbially weak creature, so 
that to express the utmost degree of weakness they say, weaker than the gnat. 



2. THE COW • 2 : 27 



Many He leaves in error by it" and many He leads aright by it. 
And He leaves in error by it only the transgressors, 27 who break 
the covenant of Allah after its confirmation and cut apart what 
Allah has ordered to be joined, and make mischief in the land. 
These it is that are the losers. 

28 How can you deny Allah and you were without life and He 
gave you life? Again, He will cause you to die and again bring 
you to life, then you shall be brought back to Him. c 29 He it is 
Who created for you all that is in the earth. And He directed Him- 
self to the heaven/ so He made them complete seven heavens; 6 
and He is Knower of all things. 

Section 4: Greatness of Mankind and Need for Revelation 

30 And when your Lord said to the angels, I am going to 
place a ruler in the earth, g they said: Will You place in it such as 



a (26-2) Allah guides people by sending His messengers, and therefore He 
could not be spoken of as leading them astray. When ascribed to God, the word 
adalla used here means He pronounced him to be erring or He left him in error. 

b (27) The covenant of Allah is the evidence of His Unity to which human 
nature bears witness. The confirmation of this covenant is brought about by send- 
ing prophets. Cutting off what Allah has ordered to be joined is the disregard of 
others' rights. 

c (28) The first part of the verse contains an argument of the existence of 
God Who gave life to man, and the second states that death on this earth is not the 
end of life but the beginning of another, an eternal and a far higher life. 

d (29-1) The earth was made after the heavens; see 79:30. 

e (29-2) The word sab 'a, which signifies the number seven, is also used as 
meaning seven or more, several or many. In 65:12 it is affirmed that as there are 
seven heavens so there is a like number of earths, and the seven heavens are 
called the seven ways in 23:17, and in this sense the orbit of a planet may be 
called its heaven. The seven heavens may also be taken to apply to the whole 
starry creation and the reference may in this case be to the magnitudes of the stars. 

/(30-1) Allah's saying to the angels is really the expression of an intention 
which is to be brought into execution. It is not a conversation, or a consultation 
with the angels; it is an expression of the Divine will to those intermediary beings 
who are entrusted by the Divine Being with its execution. The existence of such 
intermediaries has been recognized by the righteous in all ages and all countries. 

g (30-2) This shows the high place that man was destined to hold in the whole

make mischief in it and shed blood? And we celebrate Your praise 
and extol Your holiness. He said: Surely I know what you do not 
know." 31 And He taught Adam all the names^ then presented 
them to the angels; He said: Tell Me the names of those if you are 
right. 32 They said: Glory be to You! we have no knowledge but 
what You have taught us. Surely You are the Knowing, the Wise. 
33 He said: O Adam, inform them of their names. So when he 
informed them of their names, He said: Did I not say to you that I 
know what is unseen in the heavens and the earth? And I know 
what you manifest and what you hide/ 

34 And when We said to the angels, Be submissive to Adam, 
they submitted, 2 but not IblTs. He refused and was proud, and he 



of creation. What is stated here is an allegorical description of the preference of 
man above the whole of the creation on this earth, and then of the election of 
those righteous servants of Allah from among men themselves who lead others 
into the right path. One view is that the word "ruler" (khalifa) here refers to the 
whole of mankind, which is corroborated by the Quran itself in 6:165. 

a (30-3) Being entrusted with such great powers, man could use them rightly 
or wrongly. The whole history of mankind is briefly written in this one verse. 
Man is the greatest killer on this earth but he also turns the gifts of God to the best 
use. To God was known the brighter side of this picture; hence the words, / know 
what you do not know. 

b (31-1) Nowhere in the Holy Quran is it affirmed that Adam was the first 
man or that there was no creation before him. Great Muslim theologians have held 
that there were many Adams — thousands of Adams — before the great ancestor 
of mankind known by this name. Adam, therefore, though it may also be the name 
of a particular man, stands for mankind generally. 

c (31-2) Teaching Adam the names signifies the vast capability of man and 
the superiority of his knowledge to that of the angels. Or, the reference may be to 
the faculty of speech, which is the real source of the excellence of man above the 
whole of creation. 

d (33) "What you hide" refers to those great qualities in man which pre- 
ponderate the evil in him, and which remain hidden until they are made manifest 
through the Divine gift of knowledge. The immense capability of man for pro- 
gress remains hidden, while the evil of shedding blood is manifested in a very 
primary stage in his growth. 

e (34-1) Adam throughout this section stands for man generally; so sub- 
mission is to man generally. Man has a superiority over the angels on account of 
his great gift of knowledge of things, the angels being the controlling powers of

was one of the disbelievers." 35 And We said: O Adam, dwell you 
and your wife in the garden, and eat from it a plentiful (food) 
wherever you wish, and do not approach this tree or you would 
be from among the unjust. e 36 But the devil made them slip from 
it, and caused them to depart from the state in which they were. 
And We said: Go forth, some of you are enemies of others. 8 And 
there is for you in the earth an abode and a provision for a time. 



the forces of nature. By his knowledge man could harness the forces of nature and 
exercise control over them; in other words, the angels submitted to him. 

a (34-2) Iblls and Satan (Arabic: shaitan) refer to one and the same being. 
The word Iblis is used when the evil one's evil is limited to himself, and Satan, 
when his evil affects others besides himself. The angels' submission meant that 
man could control the forces of nature by his knowledge of things. But he himself 
was a part of nature, and he could not conquer his own evil desires. The conquest 
of self needed yet another act of Divine mercy, the sending of Divine Revelation. 
Note that Iblls was not one of the angels. 

b (35-1) The garden spoken of in this verse was on this earth, as it was on 
the earth that man was placed. It was certainly not the paradise to which people go 
after death, and from which they will never be expelled (15:48). The placing in 
the garden signifies leading a life of ease and comfort, as is shown by the words 
that follow: "Eat from it a plentiful food wherever you wish". These may also be 
translated as: Eat from it wherever you wish, having abundance of all things. 

c (35-2) It was the tree of the spiritual death of man, the tree of evil. Compare 
14:24-26, where a good word is likened to "a good tree, whose root is firm and 
whose branches are high, yielding its fruit in every season", and an evil word is 
likened to "an evil tree pulled up from the earth's surface; it has no stability". The 
order to eat from the earth a plentiful food but not to approach evil is really a des- 
cription of what pure human nature is. Man is entitled to all the benefits of nature 
to maintain the body so long as he does not forget his soul. 

rf(36-l) The words mean that the devil made them commit a fault uninten- 
tionally. The result was that they were made to depart from the happy condition in 
which they were. The Quran contradicts the Bible: it was not the serpent that 
misled Eve, nor did Eve mislead Adam. The devil cast an evil suggestion into the 
minds of both Adam and Eve, as he casts evil suggestions into the mind of every 
son and daughter of Adam and Eve. 

e (36-2) The new condition in which man finds himself by submitting to his 
low desires is the condition of the mutual enmity of one to the other, the tyranny 
of man to man being undoubtedly the greatest evil which man can commit. The 
use of the words "some of you are enemies of others" shows clearly that this address 
is to all mankind. 



2:37" ISRAELITE PROPHECIES FULFILLED 1 1 

37 Then Adam received (revealed) words from his Lord, and 
He turned to him (mercifully). Surely He is Oft-returning (to 
mercy), the Merciful." 38 We said: Go forth from this (state) all. 
Surely a guidance from Me will come to you, then whoever 
follows My guidance, no fear shall come upon them, nor shall 
they grieve. 6 39 And (as to) those who disbelieve in and reject Our 
messages, they are the companions of the Fire; in it they will 
abide.' 

Section 5: Israelite Prophecies fulfilled in the Quran 

40 O Children of Israel, call to mind My favour which I 
bestowed on you and be faithful to (your) covenant with Me, 
I shall fulfil (My) covenant with you; and Me, Me alone, should 
you fear. 41 And believe in what I have revealed, verifying what 



a (37) Man is found too weak to overcome the evil suggestions of the devil 
or the evil inclinations in him, however strong he may be to conquer the forces of 
nature. So God comes to his help and reveals Himself to him. He sends down 
revelation which, strengthening his faith in God, gives him the strength to over- 
come the devil and reject his suggestions. 

b (38) This is a statement of a general law that Divine Revelation will be 
granted to the whole of humanity and prophets will appear everywhere from time 
to time, and by following the guidance sent by God through His prophets people 
will attain to a state of perfection in which "no fear shall come upon them, nor 
shall they grieve". Those who truly follow the Divine Revelation shall have no 
fear of the devil misleading them, nor shall they grieve at wasting the opportunity 
given them in this life. 

c (39) The people spoken of in this verse are those who not only disbelieve 
but also exert their utmost to oppose revealed truth and uproot it. They keep 
company with evil in this life, so the fire becomes their companion in the next to 
purge them of the evil consequences of their evil deeds. Their hearts burn with 
evil passions in this life, and it is this very fire that assumes a palpable shape in 
the next. Note that the word khalidun ("abide") signifies simply abiding, which 
may be for a long time, and does not necessarily convey the idea of perpetuity. 

d (40) After speaking of the need of Divine Revelation, the Quran now speaks 
of a nation to whom this favour was granted, among whom many prophets were 
raised and who were also made rulers in the earth (see 5:20). The Jewish people 
who are addressed here are generally mentioned as Children of Israel, Israel being 
the other name of Jacob, son of Isaac, son of Abraham. For the covenants spoken 
of here, see Deuteronomy 26:17-19. The covenant included the acceptance of the 
revelation to the promised prophet of Deut. 18:18.

is (already) with you, and do not be the first to deny it; nor take a 
small price for My messages;" and keep your duty to Me, Me 
alone. 42 And do not mix up truth with falsehood, nor hide the truth 
while you know. 43 And keep up prayer and give the due charity 
and bow down with those who bow down. 44 Do you tell people to 
be good and neglect your own souls while you read the Book? 
Have you then no sense? 45 And seek assistance through patience 
and prayer, and this is hard except for the humble ones, 46 who 
know that they will meet their Lord and that to Him they will 
return. 

Section 6: Divine Favours on Israel 

47 O Children of Israel, call to mind My favour which I 
bestowed on you and that I made you excel the nations/ 48 And 
guard yourselves against a day when no soul will avail another in 
the least, neither will intercession be accepted on its behalf, nor 
will compensation be taken from it, nor will they be helped. 

49 And when We delivered you from Pharaoh's people, who 
subjected you to severe torment, killing your sons and sparing 



a (41) The verification referred to here is clearly the fulfilment of the pro- 
mise contained in Deuteronomy 18:15-18: "The Lord your God will raise up for 
you a Prophet like me from your midst, from your brethren. Him you shall 
hear. . . ". No prophet ever claimed to have come in fulfilment of this prophecy 
except the Holy Prophet Muhammad. The religious leaders rejected the truth 
which the Holy Prophet brought, fearing to lose their high position as leaders. 
They thus sacrificed truth to the inducements of this life, and took "a small price" 
for it. 

b (43) These are the two fundamental principles of religion: worship of God 
through prayer to Him, and service of humanity or helping the poor. 

c (47) By "the nations" are meant the people contemporaneous with the 
Israelites in their days of triumph, or large masses of people. Numerous prophets 
were raised among them, and they were made to rule in the earth, and these are 
the favours of which Moses also reminds them (5:20). 

d (48) The Islamic doctrine that the prophets and the righteous will intercede 
for sinners on the day of Judgment really means that if they took as their model a 
righteous servant of God and did their best to follow him, this will shelter them 
from their own weaknesses. See further 2:255 footnote 1 and 4:85 footnote.

your women, and in this there was a great trial from your Lord. 
50 And when We parted the sea for you, so We saved you and 
drowned the people of Pharaoh while you saw." 51 And when We 
appointed a time of forty nights with Moses, then you took the 
calf (for a god) after him, and you were unjust. 4 52 Then We 
pardoned you after that so that you might give thanks. 

53 And when We gave Moses the Book and the criterion that 
you might walk aright. 54 And when Moses said to his people: My 
people, you have surely wronged yourselves by taking the calf 
(for a god), so turn to your Creator (penitently), and kill your 
passions.'' That is best for you with your Creator. So He turned to 
you (mercifully). Surely He is the Oft-returning (to mercy), the 
Merciful. 

55 And when you said: Moses, we will not believe in you till 
we see Allah manifestly, so the punishment overtook you while 
you looked on. e 56 Then We raised you up after your stupor that 
you might give thanks. 57 And We made the clouds to give shade 



a (50) The Quran does not say how the Israelites were made to pass through 
the sea or in what manner the parting of the sea was brought about. One expla- 
nation is that the Israelites passed when the sea receded on account of the ebb, and 
the Egyptians were drowned because the tide was on at the time, and in their zeal 
to overtake the Israelites they did not care for it. 

b (51) While the making of the calf is attributed to Aaron in the Bible, the 
Holy Quran declares that prophet to be innocent in the matter. 

c (53) Furqdn ('criterion', 'distinction') is anything that makes a distinction 
between truth and falsity, and hence it signifies a proof or demonstration and also 
aid or victory. In the sense of distinction, the furqdn given to Moses was Pharaoh's 
drowning in the sea and the deliverance of the Israelites. In the case of the Holy 
Prophet the battle of Badr afforded the furqdn or distinction, and hence the battle 
of Badr is called yaum al-furqdn or the day of distinction in 8:41. 

d (54) The Holy Quran rejects the Bible story of the Israelites being killed as 
a punishment for calf-worship. They were pardoned and were told simply to 
repent, and God accepted their repentance as clearly stated here. Therefore 
anfusa-kum does not mean here your people, but your desires or your passions. 
No prophet ever taught that a man can be killed for the worship of an object other 
than God. 

e (55) See Exodus 19:16-17.

things that We have given you. And they did Us no harm, but they 
wronged their own souls. 

58 And when We said: Enter this city, then eat from it a 
plentiful (food) wherever you wish, and enter the gate submissively, 
and make petition for forgiveness. We will forgive you your 
wrongs and increase the reward of those who do good (to others). 
59 But those who were unjust changed the word which had been 
spoken to them, for another saying," so We sent upon the wrong- 
doers a pestilence from heaven because they transgressed. 

Section 7: Divine Favours on Israel 

60 And when Moses prayed for water for his people, We said: 
March on to the rock with your staff. e So twelve springs flowed 
from it. Each tribe knew their drinking-place. Eat and drink of the 
provisions of Allah, and do not act corruptly, making mischief in 
the land. 61 And when you said: Moses, we cannot endure one 
food, so pray your Lord on our behalf to bring forth for us out of 
what the earth grows, of its herbs and its cucumbers and its garlic 
and its lentils and its onions. He said: Would you exchange what 



a (59-1) That is to say, they went against the Divine commandment. 

b (59-2) When a punishment overtakes a people as a consequence of their 
wicked deeds it is spoken of as coming from heaven, the significance probably 
being that it cannot be averted. The pestilence spoken of here is referred to in the 
Bible in Numbers 25:8-9, according to which 24,000 men died of the plague. 

c (60) The words may mean strike the rock with your staff or march on to the 
mountain with your staff ox your community. The story that Moses carried a stone 
with him and that twelve springs flowed from it whenever, placing it in the 
wilderness, he struck it with his staff, has no foundation in the words of the Holy 
Quran or any saying of the Holy Prophet. What the words of the Quran signify is 
either that Moses was commanded by God to strike a particular rock with his staff 
from which water flowed forth miraculously, or to march on to a mountain from 
which springs flowed. 

d (61-1) The Israelites were required to live a hard life which would make 
them fit for conquering the Holy Land; this was better for them. But they wanted 
to live a life of ease and to have all kinds of food which they could get only by 
settling in towns and tilling the land.

is better for what is worse? Enter a city, so you will have what you 
ask for. And degradation and humiliation were stamped upon them, 
and they incurred Allah's wrath." That was so because they dis- 
believed in the messages of Allah and would kill the prophets 
unjustly. That was so because they disobeyed and exceeded the 
limits. 

Section 8: Israelites' Degeneration 

62 Surely those who believe, and those who are Jews, and the 
Christians, and the Sabians, 6 whoever believes in Allah and the 
Last Day and does good, they have their reward with their Lord, 
and there is no fear for them, nor shall they grieve. c 

63 And when We made a covenant with you and raised the 
mountain above you: Hold on firmly what We have given you, 
and bear in mind what is in it, so that you may guard against evil. 
64 Then after that you turned back; and if it had not been for the 
grace of Allah and His mercy on you, you would certainly have 



a (61-2) The verse speaks of the ultimate condition to which the Israelites 
were reduced when they persisted in setting at naught the Divine commandments 
and indulged in immoral and depraved practices. 

b (62-1) The commentators hold different opinions regarding Sabians, most 
of them agreeing that they are representatives of a religion between Judaism and 
Christianity, based on the doctrine of unity, but also maintaining worship of 
angels. 

c (62-2) This verse strikes at the root of the idea of a favoured nation whose 
members alone may be entitled to salvation. The subject is introduced here to 
show that even the Jews, despite their transgressions which had made them deser- 
ving of Divine wrath, were entitled to a goodly reward if they believed and did 
good deeds. The statement made here is that salvation cannot be attained by mere 
lip-profession by any people, not even by the Muslims, unless they adhere to a 
true belief and do good deeds. The existence of good people in other religions is 
not denied by the Holy Quran, but perfect peace, or the state of absolute content- 
ment which is indicated by freedom from fear and grief, is obtainable only in 
Islam, because it alone is the religion of absolute submission to the Divine Being. 

d (63) There is nothing in the words of the Quran to support the baseless 
story that the mountain was suspended in the air over the heads of the Israelites to 
frighten them into submission. The use of the word raf ("raised") is in accord- 
ance with the Arabic idiom, for it signifies the making high or lofty of a building.

been among the losers. 65 And indeed you know those among you 
who violated the Sabbath," so We said to them: Be (as) apes, despised 
and hated. 66 So We made them an example to those who wit- 
nessed it and those who came after it and an admonition to those 
who guard against evil. 

67 And when Moses said to his people: Allah commands you 
to sacrifice a cow. c They said: Do you ridicule us? He said: I seek 
refuge with Allah from being one of the ignorant. 68 They said: 
Call on jour Lord for our sake to make it plain to us what she is. 
(Moses) said: He says, Surely she is a cow neither advanced in 
age nor too young, of middle age between these (two); so do what 
you are commanded. 69 They said: Call on your Lord for our sake 
to make it clear to us what her colour is. (Moses) said: He says, 
She is a yellow cow; her colour is intensely yellow delighting the 
onlookers. 70 They said: Call on your Lord for our sake to make it 
clear to us what she is, for surely to us cows are all alike, and if 
Allah please we shall surely be guided aright. 71 (Moses) said: He 
says: She is a cow not made submissive to plough the land, nor 
does she water the crops, sound, without a blemish in her. They 
said: Now you have brought the truth. So they slaughtered her, 
though they were not inclined to do (it). 



a (65-1) There is no Sabbath among the Muslims because in Islam no 
particular day is set apart for Divine worship. On the other hand, the Muslim is 
required to pray in the very midst of his everyday work, and even the Jumu 'ah 
(Friday) prayers are no exception, for the Quran expressly allows the doing of 
work both before and after the Jumu 'ah prayers. 

b (65-2) An early commentator, Mujahid, gives the following explanation: 
"They were not transformed or metamorphosed; it is only a parable which Allah 
has set forth for them, the like of what He has set forth in likening them to asses 
(62:5), i.e., their hearts were transformed, not that they were metamorphosed into 
apes." 

c (67) As the Israelites held the cow in great honour, and even worshipped it, 
as is clear from their worship of the golden calf, they were ordered to slaughter 
such cows as were usually let loose to wander and worshipped as sacred objects, 
the aim being to root out cow-worship from among them. 



2 : 72 • THEY GROW IN HARD-HEARTEDNESS 17 

Section 9: They grow in Hard-heartedness 

72 And when you (almost) killed a man," then you disagreed 
about it. And Allah was to bring forth what you were going to 
hide. 73 So We said: Strike him with it partially. Thus Allah brings 
the dead to life, c and He shows you His signs that you may under- 
stand. 74 Then your hearts hardened after that, so that they were 
like rocks, rather worse in hardness. And surely there are some 
rocks from which streams burst forth; and there are some of them 
which split apart so water flows from them; and there are some of 
them which fall down for the fear of Allah. And Allah is not 
heedless of what you do. 

75 Do you then hope that they would believe in you, and 
some of them indeed used to hear the word of Allah, then altered 
it after they had understood it, and they know (this). 6 76 And when 
they meet those who believe they say, We believe, and when they 
are apart with one another they say: Do you talk to them of what 
Allah has disclosed to you that they may contend with you by this 
before your Lord? Do you not understand? 77 Do they not know 



a (72-1) This incident refers to Jesus, as it was with respect to his death that 
disagreement took place and many doubted his death. Compare the incidents 
narrated here with the same incidents as narrated in 4:153-157. The words you 
killed are used because the Jews asserted that they had killed him, and because 
metaphorically a person may be said to have been killed when he is made to 
appear as if he were dead. 

b (72-2) The Jews wanted to kill Jesus, but God ordained that he should not 
die. This was the bringing forth of what they were going to hide. 

c (73) The act of murder was not completed in the case of Jesus, as the 
Gospels show, for after he was taken down from the cross his legs were not 
broken, as in the case of the thieves. This was really a case of giving life to the 
dead, for Jesus Christ was dead to all appearance. Those actually dead do not 
return to life in this world; see 21:95, 23:100 and 39:42. 

rf(74) Even hardened hearts would receive life — even more, they would 
give life to others, be a source of spiritual life for others as water and streams are 
sources of life in the physical world. 

e (75) That the Israelites did not preserve their sacred books in their purity is 
a constant charge laid by the Holy Quran against the Jews. In fact, the alteration 
and corruption of the various books of the Bible is now proved beyond all doubt. 



18 2. THE COW «2:78 

that Allah knows what they keep secret and what they make known? 
78 And some of them are illiterate; they do not know the Book except 
(from) hearsay, and they only conjecture. 

79 Woe, then, to those who write the Book with their hands 
then say, This is from Allah; so that they may take for it a small 
price. So woe to them for what their hands write and woe to them 
for what they earn. 80 And they say: Fire will not touch us but for a 
few days. Say: Have you received a promise from Allah? Then 
Allah will not fail to perform His promise. Or do you speak 
against Allah what you do not know? 81 Indeed, whoever earns evil 
and his sins beset him on every side, those are the companions of 
the Fire; in it they abide.' 82 And those who believe and do good 
deeds, these are the owners of the Garden; in it they abide. e 



a (78) The Jewish masses had no access to their own sacred books which 
were known only to their learned men, and therefore their religious ideas were 
based only on stories which they knew from hearsay. The same is to a very large 
extent true of the Muslims of our day. In the early days of Islam, every individual 
Muslim, man as well as woman, sought light direct from the Quran. Not so the 
Muslims in this age who depend entirely on their learned men. They do read the 
Quran but look upon mere recitation as a meritorious deed without trying to learn 
what it says, and then act upon it. 

b (81) The inmates of the Fire are here stated to be those who earn evil, and 
find themselves beset on every side by their evil deeds. These are the people who 
give themselves up to evil, and who therefore ultimately find themselves in the 
power of evil, which even in this life, but more palpably in the life after death, 
assumes the form of a burning fire. It should be noted that the one who struggles 
against evil, however long that struggle may take, to overcome an evil inclination, 
is not the one who earns evil, because the earnest struggle in which the fighter 
against evil hates and detests evil, and seeks to overcome it, always ends in a vic- 
tory for the good and noble qualities in human beings. 

c (82) The doers of good are called ashab al-Jannah or owners of the 
Garden. The word ashab is plural of sahib which means a companion or an 
owner. I have translated ashab an-nar as companions of the Fire but ashab al- 
Jannah as owners of the Garden, because while the inmates of the Fire will be 
taken out of it after being purged of the evil, of paradise it is said that it is "a gift 
never to be cut off" (11:108), and that those in it will never be ejected from it 
(15:48). 



2:83' THEIR COVENANT AND ITS VIOLATION 1 9 

Section 10: Their Covenant and its Violation 

83 And when We made a covenant with the Children of Israel:" 
You shall serve none but Allah. And do good to (your) parents, 
and to the near of kin and to orphans and the needy, and speak 
good (words) to (all) people,* and keep up prayer and give the due 
charity. c Then you turned back except a few of you, and you are 
averse. 84 And when We made a covenant with you: You shall not 
shed your blood, nor turn your people out of your cities; then you 
promised and you bear witness. 85 Yet you it is who would kill 
your people and turn some of you out of their homes, backing 
each other up against them unlawfully and exceeding the limits. 
And if they should come to you as captives you would ransom 
them, whereas their turning out itself was unlawful for you. Do 
you then believe in a part of the Book and disbelieve in the 
other? e What then is the reward of such among you as do this but 



a (83-1) Allah's making a covenant with a people signifies His giving 
commandments to them. 

b (83-2) The word qaul (speaking) is used to express all kinds of deeds, and 
hence the speaking of good words to all stands for kind dealing with all. 

c (83-3) Prayer and zakat ("due charity") as enjoined on the Israelites 
differed from the Islamic prayer and zakat in details. The directions regarding tithe 
among the Israelites are contained in Deuteronomy 14:28-29. 

d (84) The previous verse speaks of a covenant with the Children of Israel 
while this one speaks of a covenant with you. The reference here is to the impor- 
tant treaty of mutual obligation in writing which the Holy Prophet entered into 
with the Jews when he settled at Madinah. By this treaty the Muslims and the Jews 
were bound not only not to turn their hands against each other but also to defend 
one another against a common enemy. 

e (85) The reference is to the terms of the original treaty under which the 
Jews were bound to ransom the Muslims if they were made captives by an enemy. 
They did not openly repudiate the treaty but intrigued with the enemy to turn the 
Muslims out of Madinah. The reference in believing in a part of the book and 
disbelieving in the other is to this conduct of the Jews. Most commentators, 
however, understand that the reference here is to the alliance which the two 
Jewish tribes, Quraizah and Nadir, living side by side at Madinah, had made with 
Aus and Khazraj, the two rival tribes of Madinah respectively. When the latter 
fought against each other, their allies took part in the fighting, and thus one 
Jewish tribe slaughtered and imprisoned the other and laid waste their habitations,

disgrace in the life of this world, and on the day of Resurrection 
they shall be sent back to the most grievous punishment. And Allah 
is not heedless of what you do. 86 These are they who buy the life 
of this world for the Hereafter, so their punishment shall not be 
lightened, nor shall they be helped. 

Section 1 1 : They reject the Prophet 

87 And We indeed gave Moses the Book and We sent 
messengers after him one after another; and We gave Jesus, son of 
Mary, clear arguments and strengthened him with the Holy Spirit." 
Is it then that whenever a messenger came to you with what your 
souls did not desire, you were arrogant? And some you rejected 
and others you would kill. 88 And they say: Our hearts are securely 
covered. No, Allah has cursed them on account of their unbelief; c 
so it is little that they believe. 89 And when a Book from Allah 
came to them verifying what they (already) have, and before this 
they used to pray for victory against those who disbelieved — 

but afterwards collected subscriptions for the release of the Jewish prisoners, on 
the ground that the law commanded them to redeem the prisoners and they fought 
against their co-religionists for the honour of their allies. 

a (87) Generally the epithet "son of Mary" is added to Jesus' name to show 
that he was a mortal like other prophets of God. The long chain of prophets that 
came after Moses ended in Jesus, Moses being the first and Jesus the last prophet 
of the Israelite dispensation. The idea of the Holy Ghost as met with in Christian 
religious literature is quite different from and opposed to the Jewish conception of 
the Holy Spirit which Islam accepts. The Holy Spirit is the angel which brought 
revelation: "The Holy Spirit has revealed it (i.e. the Quran) from your Lord" 
(16:102). Jesus' being strengthened with the Holy Spirit only means that he was 
granted Divine revelation like other prophets before him. 

b (88-1) The meaning is either that they said that their hearts were so full of 
knowledge already that they stood in no need of any further knowledge, or that 
their hearts were covered from hearing and accepting what the Prophet said. 

c (88-2) The allegation of the Israelites was that, being descendants of pro- 
phets, their hearts were the repositories of knowledge, and being already, as it 
were, full of knowledge, they did not stand in need of more. They are told that it 
was really their disbelief which became the cause of their estrangement from the 
good which the Holy Prophet had brought. 

d (89) The Jews expected that when the Prophet spoken of in Deuteronomy 



2 : 90 • THEY REJECT THE PROPHET 21 

but when that which they recognized came to them, they dis- 
believed in it; so Allah's curse is on the disbelievers. 90 Evil is 
what they sell their souls for — that they should deny what Allah 
has revealed, out of envy that Allah should send down of His 
grace on whomsoever of His servants He pleases; so they incur 
wrath upon wrath. And there is a humiliating punishment for the 
disbelievers. 

91 And when it is said to them, Believe in what Allah has 
revealed, they say: We believe in what was revealed to us. And 
they deny what is besides that, while it is the Truth verifying what 
they (already) have." Say: Why then did you kill Allah's prophets 
before (this) if you were believers? 92 And Moses indeed came to 
you with clear arguments, then you took the calf (for a god) in his 
absence and you were wrongdoers. 93 And when We made a cove- 
nant with you and raised the mountain above you: Take hold of 
what We have given you with firmness and obey. They said: We 
hear and disobey. e And they were made to imbibe (the love of) the 
calf into their hearts on account of their disbelief. Say: Evil is 
what your faith bids you if you are believers. 

94 Say: If the abode of the Hereafter with Allah is specially 
for you to the exclusion of the (other) people, then invoke death if 
you are truthful. 95 And they will never invoke it on account of 
what their hands have already done, and Allah knows the wrong- 
doers. 96 And you will certainly find them the greediest of people 
for life, (greedier) even than those who set up partners (with 
Allah). One of them loves to be granted a life of a thousand years, 
and his being granted a long life will in no way remove him

a (91-1) They asserted that they could accept only a revelation granted to an 
Israelite. The reply to this is that the revelation of the Holy Prophet is the truth 
verifying what is contained in their own scriptures. 

b (91-2) They tried to kill even Israelite prophets, which shows that it was 
their hard-heartedness which prevented them from accepting the truth, whether 
that truth was revealed through an Israelite or a non-Israelite prophet. 

c (93) They did not utter these words with their tongues, but it is an 
expression of their condition.

they do. 

Section 12: Their Enmity to the Prophet 

97 Say: Whoever is an enemy to Gabriel a — for surely he 
revealed it to jour heart by Allah's command, verifying what is 
(already) before it and a guidance and glad tidings for the 
believers. 98 Whoever is an enemy to Allah and His angels and His 
messengers and Gabriel and Michael, then surely Allah is an 
enemy to disbelievers. 

99 And We indeed have revealed to you clear messages, and 
none disbelieve in them except the transgressors. 100 Is it that when- 
ever they make a covenant, some of them cast it aside? No, most 
of them have no faith. 101 And when a messenger from Allah came 
to them verifying what they (already) have, some of those who 
were given the Book threw the Book of Allah behind their backs 
as if they knew nothing.' 



102 And they follow what the devils fabricated against the 
kingdom of Solomon. And Solomon did not disbelieve, but the 
devils disbelieved, teaching people enchantment. 6 And it was not 



a (97) The Jews looked upon Gabriel as their enemy because he was con- 
sidered to be an avenging angel who brought down Divine punishment upon the 
guilty. But in the Bible, as in the Holy Quran, Gabriel is mentioned as delivering 
Divine messages to men, as in Daniel 8:16 and in Luke 1:19 and 26. 

b (98) Man's enmity to Allah signifies opposition to His commandments, 
and Allah's enmity to man signifies the recompense for his opposition. Note that 
Allah is here said to be an enemy to those disbelievers only who first make them- 
selves enemies to His prophets, and hence also to the Divine Being Himself. 

c (101) The covenant referred to in v. 100 as being cast aside, and the throw- 
ing of the Book behind their backs, both refer to the Israelites paying no heed to 
the prophecy of Deuteronomy 18:18, which was verified by the advent of the 
Holy Prophet. 

d (102-1) According to an interpretation accepted by all commentators, by 
the devils here are meant human devils, or devils in the form of people. 

e (102-2) The Arabic word sihr ("enchantment") signifies 'the producing of 
what is false in the form of truth', and 'embellishment by falsification and deceit'.

revealed to the two angels in Babel — Harut and Mariit. Nor did 
they teach (it to) anyone, so that they should have said, We are 
only a trial, so do not disbelieve. But they learn from these two 
(sources) that by which they make a distinction between a man 
and his wife. And they cannot hurt with it anyone except with 
Allah's permission. And they learn that which harms them and 
does not benefit them. And certainly they know that he who buys 
it has no share of good in the Hereafter. And surely evil is the 
price for which they have sold their souls; if only they knew! 
i° 3 And if they had believed and kept their duty, reward from Allah 
would certainly have been better; if only they knew! 

Section 13: Previous Scriptures are abrogated 

104 O you who believe, do not say Rd 'i-na and say Unzur-na, 
and listen. And for the disbelievers there is a painful punishment.* 
105 Neither those who disbelieve from among the people of the 
Book, nor the idolaters, like that any good should be sent down to 
you from your Lord. And Allah chooses whom He pleases for His 
mercy; and Allah is the Lord of mighty grace. 106 Whatever message 
We abrogate or cause to be forgotten, We bring one better than it 
or one like it. c Do you not know that Allah is Powerful over 



a (102-3) What the Quran says here is that the Jews, instead of following the 
word of God, followed certain evil crafts which they falsely attributed to Solomon 
and to two angels at Babel (Harut and Marat). Solomon is declared free of any 
such sinfulness attributed to him, and the story of the two angels is declared to be 
a fabrication. But the Jews are blamed for learning from these two sources, i.e., by 
their fabrications against Solomon and the story of the two angels, things by 
which they made a distinction between a man and his wife. These words refer to 
secret gatherings of the nature of masonic societies, for it is in freemasonry and in 
no other religious society of the world that women are totally excluded. The 
words, they cannot hurt with it anyone except with Allah 's permission, show that 
by this craft they intended to inflict some injury on the Holy Prophet. 

b (104) Ra'i-na is equivalent to listen to us, but with a slight change of 
accent it becomes ra'ina, which means he is foolish. The word unzur-na, which 
means wait for us or grant us a little delay, is suggested instead, because it cannot 
be distorted. Morally the injunction is worthy of the highest regard, as it disappro- 
ves of the use of words bearing a sinister meaning. 

c (106) The objection of the Jews was: Why was another revelation sent

all things? 107 Do you not know that Allah's is the kingdom of the 
heavens and the earth, and that besides Allah you have not any 
friend or helper? 108 Rather you wish to put questions to your 
Messenger, as Moses was questioned before. And whoever adopts 
disbelief instead of faith he indeed has lost the right direction of 
the way. 109 Many of the people of the Book wish that they could 
turn you back into disbelievers after you have believed, out of envy 
from themselves, after truth has become clear to them. But pardon 
and forgive, till Allah bring about His command." Surely Allah is 
Powerful over all things. 

110 And keep up prayer and give the due charity. And what- 
ever good you send on ahead for yourselves, you will find it with 
Allah. Surely Allah is Seer of what you do. m And they say: None 
shall enter the Garden except he who is a Jew, or the Christians.* 
These are their vain desires. Say: Bring your proof if you are 
truthful. 112 No, whoever submits himself entirely to Allah and he 
is the doer of good (to others), he has his reward from his Lord, 
and there is no fear for such nor shall they grieve. c 



down to Muhammad, and why was a law containing new commandments promul- 
gated? The answer is that if one law (i.e. the Jewish law) was abrogated, one 
better than it was given through the Holy Prophet. The doctrine that some of the 
Quranic verses were abrogated by others, though a generally accepted view, is due 
to a misconception of the words of this verse and is based simply on conjecture. 
There are no discrepancies in the Quran, and it is want of reflection on it that is 
responsible for the theory of abrogation. 

a (109) Note that Muslims are told to pardon and forgive even such enemies. 

b (111) What is said here may be expanded thus: The Jews say that none 
shall enter the Garden except a Jew and the Christians say that none shall enter 
the Garden except the Christians. Both degraded religion to a belief in a set of 
doctrines, and leading a life of righteousness was not considered as of the essence 
of religion. 

c (112) Their assertions that only the Jews and the Christians will be saved 
are groundless. It is entire submission to God and the doing of good to His crea- 
tures that is the true source of salvation, and that is what 'Islam' means according 
to the Holy Quran. The name Islam is derived from aslama, meaning 'submission' 
or 'entering into peace'. See also 3:19 footnote. 



2:113' PERFECT GUIDANCE IS ONLY IN ISLAM 25 



Section 14: Perfect Guidance is only in Islam 

113 And the Jews say, The Christians follow nothing (good), 
and the Christians say, The Jews follow nothing (good), while 
they recite the (same) Book. Even thus say those who have no 
knowledge, like what they say." So Allah will judge between them 
on the day of Resurrection in that in which they differ. 

114 And who is more unjust than he who prevents (people) 
from the mosques of Allah, from His name being remembered in 
them, and strives to ruin them? (As for) these, it was not proper 
for them to enter them except in fear. For them is disgrace in this 
world, and theirs is a grievous punishment in the Hereafter. 
115 And Allah's is the East and the West, so whichever way you 
turn, there is Allah's purposed Surely Allah is Ample-giving, 
Knowing. 

116 And they say: Allah has taken to Himself a son — glory 
be to Him! Rather, whatever is in the heavens and the earth is His. 
All are obedient to Him. 117 Wonderful Originator of the heavens 



a (113) The Jews and the Christians are here blamed for denying all good in 
each other like ignorant people, despite both being followers of one Book, by 
which is here meant the Old Testament, which both accepted. As against this, the 
Quran accepts that there is partial truth in all religions. 

b (114) The idolatrous Quraish had turned the Muslims out of the Sacred 
Mosque at Makkah and the Jews and the Christians were now helping them to 
annihilate the small Muslim community in Madinah, which practically meant the 
laying waste of the Sacred Mosque itself. The word mosques is used here because 
the Sacred Mosque was to be the centre of all the mosques of the world. This 
generalization further shows that the fate of all those who prevented Muslims 
from worshipping Allah in mosques is predicted here, and the fate of the oppo- 
nents of the Holy Prophet bears ample testimony to the truth of this prediction. 

c (115) These words point clearly to the Divine promise that all obstacles in 
the path of the Muslims will be removed and victory will follow their footsteps. 

rf(116) The phrase "glory be to Him" {subhana-hu) is always used to dec- 
lare the freedom of the Divine Being from all imperfections, and is always 
mentioned in connection with the Christian doctrine that God has a son to show 
that to attribute a son to the Divine Being is to attribute an imperfection to Him, 
which is met with in human beings. The doctrine of sonship is mentioned here as 
being opposed to the religion which requires entire submission to Divine

and the earth! And when He decrees an affair, He only says to it, 
Be, and it is." 118 And those who have no knowledge say: Why 
does not Allah speak to us or a sign come to us? Even thus said 
those before them, like what they say. Their hearts are all alike. 
Indeed We have made the messages clear for a people who are 
sure. 119 Surely We have sent you with the Truth as a bearer of 
good news and as a warner, and you will not be called upon to 
answer for the companions of the flaming Fire. 

120 And the Jews will not be pleased with you, nor the 
Christians, unless you follow their religion. Say: Surely Allah's 
guidance — that is the (perfect) guidance. And if you follow their 
desires after the knowledge that has come to you, you shall have 
from Allah no friend, nor helper. 121 Those to whom We have 
given the Book follow it as it ought to be followed. e These believe 
in it. And whoever disbelieves in it, these it is that are the losers. 

Section 15: Covenant with Abraham 

122 O Children of Israel, call to mind My favour which I 
bestowed on you and that I made you excel the nations. 123 And be 



commandments from every person and thus dispenses with the necessity of a 
conciliator. 

a (117) This is the oft-recurring phrase in which Allah's act of the creation 
and annihilation of things is spoken of in the Holy Quran. It is not meant by this 
that there is no gradual process in the creation of things. It is, in fact, an answer to 
those who think that the creation of things by God is dependent on the previous 
existence of matter and soul and the adaptability of their attributes. The argument 
given here in the word "Originator" (bad!') is that man, who stands in need of 
matter to make things, also stands in need of a pattern after which to make them, 
but God stands in need of neither. 

b (118) The answer to both these demands is contained in v. 119, for as a 
bearer of good news the Holy Prophet told them that if they purified themselves 
by walking in his footsteps, Allah would speak to them, and as a warner he 
informed them of the coming wrath (the sign which they often demanded) if they 
persisted in their evil ways. 

c (121) The Muslims are meant, while the Book is the Quran. 

d (122) The Israelites are three times told in the Holy Quran (see earlier 2:40 
and 2:47) that God had made them a great nation but that it was by their own evil 



2:124' COVENANT WITH ABRAHAM 27 

on your guard against a day when no soul will avail another in the 
least, neither will any compensation be accepted from it, nor will 
intercession benefit it, nor will they be helped. 

124 And when his Lord tried Abraham with certain commands 
he fulfilled them. He said: Surely I will make you a leader of 
people. (Abraham) said: And of my offspring? My covenant does 
not include the wrongdoers, said He." 125 And when We made the 
House a resort for people and a (place of) security, and (saying): 
Take the Place of Abraham for a place of prayer. c And We 



deeds and forsaking the ways of righteousness that they were proving themselves 
unworthy of that greatness. Here they are being addressed the third time and 
reminded of the covenant which was made with Abraham, the great patriarch in 
whom the Israelites and the Ishmaelites met. 

a (124) Abraham was made spiritual leader of people because he was found 
perfect in fulfilling the Divine commandments. As a spiritual leader of three great 
nations of the world, that patriarch occupies a unique position. Having discussed 
at length that a prophet from the Ishmaelites had come in accordance with the 
prophecies of the Israelite prophets, the Holy Quran now proceeds to show that 
even the covenant with their great ancestor Abraham necessitated the appearance 
of a prophet in Arabia. The second part of the verse states that the spiritual 
leadership of the world was still with Abraham's descendants. The covenant was 
made, not with Israel but with Abraham, and that therefore the seed of Ishmael 
and Isaac were equally to be blessed. In fact, as stated further on in 2:125, the 
covenant was made with both Abraham and Ishmael. The Jewish and Christian 
contention that the covenant made with Ishmael was simply of a temporal nature 
is groundless. 

b (125-1) Al-Bait or The House is the famous house known by this name to 
this day, the Ka'bah. It is also known as Bait Allah or the House of Allah, and is 
the same as the Bethel of the Bible. History bears out these three distinguishing 
characteristics of the Ka'bah. It exists from the remotest antiquity, it was visited 
annually by people from the most distant corners of Arabia, and its sacredness 
was respected by the whole of Arabia. 

c (125-2) The Ka'bah, the spiritual centre of Islam, was connected with the 
name of Abraham, and pointed reference to this is made in the mention of Maqam 
Ibrahim or the Place of Abraham. It is true that a particular place, a small building 
supported by six pillars about eight feet high, situated in the Ka'bah, is known by 
this name, and is incontrovertible evidence of Abraham's connection with Arabia 
and its spiritual centre. But here really Maqam Ibrahim stands for the House 
itself. The injunction to take the Place of Abraham for a place of prayer means 
that the Ka'bah shall be the Central Mosque of the Muslims. It is called the Place 



28 2. THE COW • 2 : 126 

commanded Abraham and Ishmael," saying: Purify My House for 
those who visit (it) and those who abide (in it) for devotion and 
those who bow down (and) those who prostrate themselves. 
126 And when Abraham said: My Lord, make this a secure town 
and provide its people with fruits, such of them as believe in Allah 
and the Last Day. He said: And whoever disbelieves, I shall grant 
him enjoyment for a short while, then I shall drive him to the 
punishment of the Fire. And it is an evil destination. 

127 And when Abraham and Ishmael raised the foundations 
of the House: e Our Lord, accept from us; surely You are the 
Hearing, the Knowing. 128 0ur Lord, and make us both submissive 
to You, and (raise) from our offspring, a nation submissive to 
You, and show us our ways of devotion and turn to us (merci- 
fully); surely You are the Oft-returning (to mercy), the Merciful. 
129 0ur Lord, and raise up in them a Messenger from among them 
who shall recite to them Your messages and teach them the Book 



of Abraham because it was Abraham who purified it of the idols and it was 
Abraham who rebuilt The House as stated further on. 

a (125-3) Ishmael's connection with Arabia is established by the Bible itself, 
for Kedar (son of Ishmael, Genesis 25:13) stands throughout the writings of the 
Old Testament for Arabia (Psalms 120:5, Isaiah 42:11 and 60:7). The Arab tradi- 
tion representing Abraham as coming with Hagar and Ishmael to the place where 
now Makkah is, is quite independent of the Bible statement, and the facts recor- 
ded in the Quran are borne out fully by Arab tradition and the Bible. 

b (126) Abraham, when settling Hagar and Ishmael near the Sacred House, 
which was already there, laid the foundations of the city of Makkah there. While 
Abraham prayed for provisions of life for the righteous only, God's acceptance of 
the prayer included the wicked of that city as well (see 28:57). 

c (127) Abraham and Ishmael rebuilt the Ka'bah, which was already there; 
see 14:37. 

d (128) The word translated as submissive is Muslim in the original. A Muslim 
is so called because he surrenders himself to the will of God or because he is 
secure from the slavery of the devil or because he enters into peace. Though all 
prophets were Muslims but only the followers of the Prophet Muhammad are 
known as a Muslim nation. At the time when these verses were revealed, there 
existed only a few Muslims in Madinah, and reference to a Muslim nation was 
still prophetical. 



2:130' THE RELIGION OF ABRAHAM 29 

and the Wisdom, and purify them. Surely You are the Mighty, 
the Wise." 

Section 16: The Religion of Abraham 

130 And who forsakes the religion of Abraham but he who 
makes a fool of himself. And certainly We made him pure in this 
world, and in the Hereafter he is surely among the righteous. 
131 When his Lord said to him, Submit, he said: I submit myself to 
the Lord of the worlds. 132 And the same did Abraham command 
his sons, and (so did) Jacob: My sons, surely Allah has chosen for 
you (this) religion, so do not die except as submitting ones. 133 0r 
were you witnesses when death visited Jacob, when he said to his 
sons: What will you serve after me? They said: We shall serve 
your God and the God of your fathers, Abraham and Ishmael and 
Isaac, one God only, and to Him do we submit. 134 Those are a 
people that have passed away; for them is what they earned and 
for you what you earn; and you will not be asked of what they did. 

135 And they say: Be Jews or Christians, you will be on the 
right course. Say: Rather, (we follow) the religion of Abraham, 
the upright one, 6 and he was not of those who set up partners (with 
Allah). 136 Say: We believe in Allah and (in) what has been 
revealed to us, and (in) what was revealed to Abraham, and 
Ishmael and Isaac and Jacob and the tribes, and (in) what was 
given to Moses and Jesus, and (in) what was given to the prophets 
from their Lord, we make no distinction between any of them and 



a (129) The Messenger had appeared but the great task of teaching the Book 
and the Wisdom to the progeny of Ishmael, the Arabs, and the still greater task of 
purifying them of evil, had yet to be performed, and its mention at this time was 
therefore prophetical. The more one ponders on the unique transformation brought 
about by the Holy Prophet in Arabia, and through Arabia in the world, the more 
one's head bows before the grandeur of this prophecy. 

b (135) The word hanlf or "upright" is often mentioned in connection with 
the name of Abraham and the Holy Prophet, and his followers are also enjoined to 
be hanlf Muslims are enjoined to remain firm in the right state, and thus to be the 
true representatives of the Abrahamic faith in the world. It is for this reason that 
the word hanlf is used here in opposition to the attitude of both the Jews and the 
Christians. 



30 2. THE COW • 2 : 137 

to Him we submit." 137 So if they believe as you believe, they are 
indeed on the right course; and if they turn back, then they are 
only in opposition. But Allah will be sufficient for you against 
them; and He is the Hearing, the Knowing. 138 (We take) Allah's 
colour, and who is better than Allah at colouring, and we are His 
worshippers. 139 Say: Do you dispute with us about Allah, and He 
is our Lord and your Lord, and for us are our deeds and for you 
your deeds; and we are sincere to Him? 140 Or do you say that 
Abraham and Ishmael and Isaac and Jacob and the tribes were 
Jews or Christians? Say: Do you know better or Allah? And who 
is more unjust than he who conceals a testimony that he has from 
Allah? And Allah is not heedless of what you do. 141 Those are a 
people that have passed away; and for them is what they earned 



a (136) This shows the cosmopolitan nature of a Muslim's belief. Not only is 
belief in the great prophets of Israel an article of faith with a Muslim, but the 
words what was given to the prophets from their Lord make the Muslim concep- 
tion of belief in prophets as wide as the world. And it should be noted that this 
broad conception was promulgated at a time when the Jews and the Christians 
were exerting themselves to the utmost against the new faith. 

b (138) The religion of Islam is called Allah's colour because God is upper- 
most in a Muslim's ideas, and because his views are as broad as humanity. This 
particular word has also been adopted here as a hint to Christians that baptism of 
water does not effect any change in a person. It is the baptism of the broad prin- 
ciple of faith, accepting the prophets of all nations, that brings about change in the 
mentality of man. It is through this baptism that the new birth is received, because 
it opens the mind for the reception of all truth, and inspires it with love and rev- 
erence for all good people. 

c (139) A Muslim's conception of Allah is very broad. It includes all that is 
best in all other religions, but is free from the limitations they put. Therefore no 
one who is true to his religion can dispute the Muslim conception of the Divine 
Being. Moreover, every religion of the world limits the spiritual sustenance of 
God to one nation or one country. Not so Islam, which says that the truth was 
revealed to every nation. Every nation thus accepts partial truth, only that part of 
the truth which was revealed to it, but Islam accepts the whole truth. 

d (140) The Jewish claim was that only acceptance of the Jewish law could 
save man, and the Christians claimed that none could be saved unless he accepted 
the atonement of Jesus. They are told that their ancestors who were prophets were 
the followers of neither the one nor the other. Islam was, in fact, a reversion to the 
simple faith of sincerity, the faith of Abraham and his immediate followers and 
descendants.

2 : 142 • THE KA'BAH AS THE SPIRITUAL CENTRE 3 1 

and for you what you earn; and you will not be asked concerning 
what they did. 

Section 17: The Ka'bah as the Spiritual Centre 

142 The fools among the people will say: What has turned 
them from their qiblah which they had? Say: The East and the 
West belong only to Allah; He guides whom He pleases to the 
right path." 143 And thus We have made you an exalted nation 
that you may be the bearers of witness to the people and (that) the 
Messenger may be a bearer of witness to you. e And We did not 
make that which you would have to be the qiblah but that We 



a (142) Qiblah means the direction or point towards which one turns his 
face. In its religious usage it means the direction towards which a person turns his 
face when saying his prayers, and the qiblah is thus the Spiritual Centre of a 
people. The change here referred to is the change which took place at Madinah 
about sixteen months after the Prophet's flight to that city. While the Holy 
Prophet was at Makkah among the idolaters, he used to pray with his face to the 
Holy Temple at Jerusalem, but when he came to Madinah, where the Jewish ele- 
ment was strong and powerful, he was directed by Divine Revelation to turn his 
face to the Ka'bah as his qiblah. If Abraham's seed was to be blessed in Ishmael's 
progeny, it was necessary that the new Spiritual Centre should be the house puri- 
fied by Abraham and Ishmael, the First House appointed for mankind, the temple 
at Jerusalem being only the spiritual centre of the Israelites. 

b (143-1) The word wasat ("exalted") signifies the middle part of anything; 
and therefore, as being removed from either extreme, it signifies the best part of a 
thing. The commentators explain wasat as meaning equitable and exalted. By making 
the Ka'bah their qiblah, Allah had made it known that they were the people, the 
Muslim nation, for whom Abraham had prayed (v. 128), and therefore they were 
the inheritors of all those Divine blessings which had been promised to the seed of 
Abraham. 

c (143-2) The bearers of witness are the persons who carry knowledge to 
others, bearing testimony to its truth in their own persons. Some commentators 
explain the word shahid ("bearer of witness") as meaning a purifier. But it also 
means an Imam or a leader, and the significance is that just as the Prophet deli- 
vered the message of truth to the Muslims and was their purifier and leader, the 
role of the Muslim community was to deliver the message of truth to the whole of 
humanity and to be its purifiers and leaders. 

d (143-3) The words "that which you would have to be the qiblah" mean on 
which you had firmly set your heart that it should be your qiblah. It thus appears 
that the Prophet longed that the Ka'bah should be his qiblah, yet he did not take

might distinguish him who follows the Messenger from him who 
turns back upon his heels. And it was indeed a hard test except for 
those whom Allah has guided. Nor was Allah going to make your 
faith to be fruitless. Surely Allah is Compassionate, Merciful, to 
the people. 144 Indeed We see the turning of jour face to heaven, so 
We shall surely make you master of the qiblah which you like; a 
turn then jour face towards the Sacred Mosque. And wherever 
you are, turn your faces towards it. And those who have been 
given the Book certainly know that it is the truth from their Lord. 
And Allah is not heedless of what they do. 

145 And even if you should bring to those who have been 
given the Book every sign they would not follow jour qiblah, nor 
can jou be a follower of their qiblah, neither are they the follow- 
ers of each other's qiblah. c And ifjou should follow their desires 
after the knowledge that has come to jou, then jou would indeed 
be from among the wrongdoers. 146 Those whom We have given 
the Book recognize him as they recognize their sons, but some of 



any step until he had received the Divine Revelation. If his revelations had been 
the outcome of his own desires he would not have waited for sixteen months for a 
revelation from on high to change the qiblah. 

a (144-1) The Holy Prophet is here told that the Ka'bah will not remain an 
idol temple, as he will soon be master of it, and idolatry will forever be swept off 
from the new Spiritual Centre of the world. 

b (144-2) The truth of the Prophet was manifest so far as the Jews and the 
Christians were concerned. There was a clear prophecy for the appearance of a 
Prophet who was to be the like of Moses; see Deut. 18:15-18. They also knew 
that God had promised to bless Ishmael, but that no prophet had up to this time 
appeared from among the Ishmaelites. They also knew that Ishmael was left in 
Arabia, and they identified his son, Kedar, with the Arabs. Isaiah 21:13 speaks in 
clear words of a prophecy about "Arabia" and of the Prophet's Flight. The Bait 
Allah (Ka'bah) was the only Beit-el that the world knew. 

c (145) Every sign of the Prophet's truth had been given to them already but 
their hearts were so hardened that they did not pay any attention to the clearest 
signs. But they were not agreed even among themselves. Although the Jews and 
Christians both looked to the temple at Jerusalem as their central temple, they 
were not agreed upon it as their qiblah or Spiritual Centre. 

d (146) All the prophets of Abraham's seed had hitherto appeared among the 
Children of Israel, and hence as they know their sons is equivalent to as they

from your Lord, so do not be from among the doubters." 

Section 18: The Ka'bah as the Spiritual Centre 

148 And everyone has a goal to which he turns (himself), so 
vie with one another in good works.* Wherever you are, Allah will 
bring you all together. Surely Allah is Powerful over all things. 
149 And from whatsoever place you come forth, turn your face 
towards the Sacred Mosque. e And surely it is the truth from your 



know the Israelite prophets, the significance being that the Israelites or the Jews 
recognized the Prophet who appeared among the Children of Ishmael, as they 
recognized the prophets who appeared among the Children of Israel. 

a (147) It is the reader who is addressed here. 

b (148) In making the Ka'bah the Spiritual Centre the Muslims are told that 
their goal, as a nation, is to lead the world on to the greatest good. Their race is 
not a race for material benefits, riches or power, but a race for the attainment of 
good and for the spread of good. Hence they must vie with one another in doing 
good. In the words that follow — wherever you are, Allah will bring you all 
together — they are told that they will be spread far and wide in the world, yet 
their goal must be one. The outward unity of the qiblah stands for their unity of 
purpose, and it forms the basis on which rests the brotherhood of Islam; hence the 
saying of the Prophet: "Do not call those who follow your qiblah unbelievers". 

c (149) The Ka'bah has never been supposed by any Muslim to possess any 
Divine attribute. The Muslims honour the Ka'bah because it is their Spiritual 
Centre; they do not worship it. It should also be borne in mind that the famous 
Black Stone was not one of the Arab idols, nor can the kissing of it in performing 
the pilgrimage be looked upon as a remnant of idolatry. That Stone stands only as 
a monument: "The stone which the builders rejected has become the chief corner- 
stone" (Psalms, 118:22). Ishmael was looked upon as rejected, and the covenant 
was considered to have been made with the children of Isaac, yet it was that rejec- 
ted stone, for which the Black Stone at the Ka'bah stands as a monument, that 
was to become "the chief cornerstone". Jesus Christ made this clear in the parable 
of the husbandmen, when he plainly told the Israelites that the vineyard (i.e., the 
kingdom of God) would be taken away from them and given to "other husband- 
men", i.e. to a non-Israelite people, giving indication of that people in the words: 
"Have you never read in the Scriptures, The stone which the builders rejected has 
become the chief cornerstone?" (Matthew, 21:42). And he added: "The kingdom 
of God will be taken from you and given to a nation bearing the fruits of it" 
(Matthew, 21:43), thus showing that he was referring to a rejected nation which 
was to become the corner-stone of the Divine kingdom.

Lord. And Allah is not heedless of what you do. 150 And from 
whatsoever place you come forth, turn your face towards the 
Sacred Mosque. And wherever you are, turn your faces towards it, 
so that people may have no plea against you except such of them 
as are unjust — so do not fear them and fear Me — and that I may 
complete My favour to you and that you may go aright." 151 Even 
as We have sent among you a Messenger from among you, who 
recites to you Our messages and purifies you and teaches you the 
Book and the Wisdom and teaches you what you did not know. 
152 Therefore glorify Me, I will make you eminent, and give thanks 
to Me and do not be ungrateful to Me. 

Section 19: Hard Trials necessary to establish Truth 

153 O you who believe, seek assistance through patience and 
prayer; surely Allah is with the patient. 154 And do not speak of 
those who are slain in Allah's way as dead. Rather, (they are) 
alive, but you do not perceive. 155 And We shall certainly try you 



a (150) By completing of favour is meant the bestowing of spiritual favours 
on the Muslims. In the next verse they are told that they have been raised to carry 
the Divine message to other people and to purify them and teach them the Book 
and the Wisdom. If that message was not conveyed to other people they had a 
plea against the Muslims that they had not conveyed the Truth to them. The turn- 
ing of the face to the Sacred Mosque is thus equivalent to proclaiming the Truth 
which had its origin in the Ka'bah to the whole world. The Ka'bah was the house 
rebuilt by Abraham and Ishmael, and with prophethood now being transferred to 
the descendants of Ishmael, the Spiritual Centre had necessarily to be changed. 
The Ka'bah was moreover the first Spiritual Centre of the world (3:96), and it was 
in the fitness of things that it should be the last Spiritual Centre of the whole 
world. 

b (151) The reference is to Abraham's prayer in v. 129. The functions of the 
Promised Prophet there are exactly the same as here. 

c (152) These words may be translated either as remember Me I will remem- 
ber you or as glorify Me I will make you eminent, for the word dhikr carries either 
significance, remembrance or honouring. Adopting either significance, what is 
stated here is that if the Muslims keep God in the forefront of their programme, 
they will be made great as a nation. 

d (154) The sacrifice of life which must be undertaken in the cause of Truth 
is hinted at in this passage. The words rendered literally as in Allah 's way or in

with something of fear and hunger and loss of property and lives 
and fruits. And give good news to the patient," 156 who, when a 
misfortune befalls them, say: Surely we are Allah's, and to Him 
we shall return. 157 Those are they on whom are blessings and 
mercy from their Lord; and those are the followers of the right 
course. 

158 The Safa and the Marwah are truly among the signs of 
Allah; c so whoever makes a pilgrimage to the House or pays a 
visit (to it), there is no blame on him if he goes round them. And 
whoever does good spontaneously — surely Allah is Bountiful in 
rewarding, Knowing. 159 Those who conceal the clear proofs and 
the guidance that We revealed after We have made it clear in the 
Book for people, these it is whom Allah curses, and those who 

the cause of Allah, frequently occurring in the Holy Quran, signify the cause of 
Truth. A Christian translator's comment that the words in the way of Allah mean 
"war undertaken against unbelievers for the propagation of Islam" is baseless. 
Carrying the message of Islam to non-Muslims is indeed the duty of a Muslim, 
and anyone engaged in this work is undoubtedly working in the way of Allah, but 
that a Muslim was required to carry the message of God at the point of the sword 
is no more than a myth. 

a (155) The Muslims had already made great sacrifices in the cause of Allah. 
They had left their homes, their near and dear ones and everything they had, 
behind them at Makkah, and had come to Madinah empty-handed, but they were 
now told that they would have to make more sacrifices yet. They would have to 
face fear and hunger and all kinds of losses, even death itself. If they bore all 
these sufferings with steadfastness, they would have a great future, of which the 
good news is given to them beforehand. Those who have sacrificed their lives in 
the cause of Truth gain the life eternal, while the dead are really those who are dead 
in ignorance. 

b (156) This is the true expression of a Muslim's resignation under trials: We 
are Allah 's and to Him we shall return. He resigns himself to the will of God so 
thoroughly that no trial or misfortune can disturb the course of his life, which has 
a much higher goal before it than mere comfort. 

c (158) The Safa and the Marwah are two mountains near Makkah. They 
were the scene of Hagar's running to and fro in quest of water when left alone 
with Ishmael in the wilderness. These two mountains now serve as two monu- 
ments of the reward which patience brought, and it is as a memorial to Hagar's 
patience that they are now gone round by the pilgrims.

curse, curse them (too)." 160 Except those who repent and amend 
and make manifest (the truth), these it is to whom I turn (merci- 
fully); and I am the Oft-returning (to mercy), the Merciful. 
161 Those who disbelieve and die while they are disbelievers, these 
it is on whom is the curse of Allah and the angels and people, of 
all (of them): ' 162 abiding in it; their punishment shall not be light- 
ened nor shall they be given respite. 163 And your God is one God; 
there is no God but He! He is the Beneficent, the Merciful. c 

Section 20: Unity must prevail 

164 In the creation of the heavens and the earth, and the alter- 
nation of night and day, and the ships that run in the sea with that 
which benefits mankind, and the water that Allah sends down 
from the sky, then gives life with it to the earth after its death and 
spreads in it all (kinds of) animals, and the changing of the winds 
and the clouds made subservient between heaven and earth, there 
are surely signs for a people who understand. 165 Yet there are 
some people who take for themselves objects of worship besides 



a (159) As against those who willingly endure all kinds of sufferings in the 
cause of truth, the Quran now speaks of people who hide the truth, i.e., they neither 
act according to it, nor do they carry the message to others. These words convey a 
warning to the Muslims. 

6(161) This verse continues the subject-matter of v. 159, the disbelievers 
spoken of here being those who hide the truth. The curse of God stands for their 
estrangement from God, the curse of the angels signifies their loss of all incentive 
to good and noble deeds, and the curse of people signifies their subjugation to 
other people. 

c (163) The mention of Divine Unity is to show that it was for this object 
that the trials and privations spoken of in this section were to be undergone. The 
ultimate triumph of Divine Unity is spoken of in the next section. 

d (164) The unity of God is declared by the whole of nature, and being such 
a clear doctrine, must no doubt at last prevail over idolatry and polytheism of 
every kind. Not only did Arabia witness the truth of this at the time of the Holy 
Prophet, but even today we see that, as man is freed from the trammels of pre- 
judice, he realizes the truth of Divine Unity more and more. The uniformity that is 
clearly observed in the diversity of nature is constantly appealed to in the Quran 
as a sign of the Unity of the Maker.

Allah," whom they love as they should love Allah. And those who 
believe are stronger in (their) love for Allah. And if only the 
wrongdoers had seen, when they see the punishment, that power is 
wholly Allah's, and that Allah is Severe in punishing! 166 When 
those who were followed renounce those who followed (them), 
and they see the punishment and their ties are cut apart. i fi7 And 
those who followed will say: If only we could return, we would 
renounce them as they have renounced us. Thus will Allah show 
them their deeds to be intense regret to them, and they will not 
escape from the Fire. c 

Section 21: Prohibited Foods 

168 O people, eat the lawful and good things from what is in 
the earth, and do not follow the footsteps of the devil. Surely he is 
an open enemy to you. 169 He commands you only (to commit) 
evil and indecency, and that you speak against Allah what you do 
not know. 



a (165-1) The objects of worship here referred to may include idols, but the 
reference is apparently to the leaders who lead their followers into evil. This is 
made plain by the verses that follow, where "those who were followed", i.e. the 
leaders, renounce those who followed them. 

b (165-2) While Allah's love for His creatures is the ever-recurring theme 
expressed in the Quran, the believer's love for Allah, or absolute submission to 
the Divine Being, is here declared to be stronger than all other ties of love and 
friendship, including that which unites a man to his idols or other false deities. 

c (167) The mutual renouncement of the leaders and their followers takes 
place sometimes in this very life. It should also be noted that it is the intense regret 
for the evil deeds done, here described as being the Fire, from which there is no 
escape. 

rf(168) The fundamental principle of faith, Divine Unity, having been 
discussed, certain secondary rules and regulations are now considered, and among 
these the subject of prohibited foods is introduced first with a twofold object. 
Firstly, only lawful and good things should be eaten. Lawful things are not only 
those which the law has not declared to be forbidden, but even unforbidden things 
become unlawful if they are acquired unlawfully, by theft, cheating, etc. Secondly, 
by adding the injunction do not follow the footsteps of the devil, the Quran 
recognizes some sort of relation between the physical and the spiritual conditions 
of man. 



38 2. THE COW • 2 : 170 

170 And when it is said to them, Follow what Allah has 
revealed, they say: But we follow that (path) upon which we found 
our fathers. What! Even though their fathers had no sense at all, 
nor did they follow the right way. 171 And the parable of those who 
disbelieve is as the parable of one who calls out to that which hears 
no more than a call and a cry. Deaf, dumb, blind, so they have no 
sense." 172 you who believe, eat of the good things that We have 
provided you with, and give thanks to Allah if He it is Whom you 
serve. 173 He has forbidden you only what dies of itself, and 
blood, and the flesh of swine, e and that on which any other name 
than that of Allah has been invoked. Then whoever is driven by 
necessity, not desiring, nor exceeding the limit, no sin is upon him. 
Surely Allah is Forgiving, Merciful. 

174 Those who conceal anything of the Book that Allah has 
revealed and take for it a small price, they eat nothing but fire into 
their bellies/ and Allah will not speak to them on the day of 



a (171) The Prophet is likened to the crier who calls out, but the disbelievers 
are deaf to reason, and are like cattle which only hear the cry of the driver, but do 
not understand the meaning of what he says. This is in accordance with what is 
said in the previous verse. 

b (172) The injunction to eat of the good things is directed against the use of 
things which are injurious to health, though they may not be forbidden by law. 

c (173-1) The Jews held the swine in great detestation, and the mention of 
the animal in the Gospels shows that Jesus Christ held it in equal abhorrence, 
which proves that he too regarded the animal as impure. Neither does he appear to 
have broken the Jewish law in this respect. 

d (173-2) The words that over which any other name than that of Allah has 
been invoked are said by commentators to refer to animals slaughtered by the 
worshippers of idols, which they used to slaughter as offerings to their idols or to 
those over which the name of an idol is invoked at the time of its slaughter. But 
the statement made in the Quran is general, and the invocation of any name other 
than that of Allah makes the animal slaughtered unlawful. 

e (174) The prohibition to eat certain impure or injurious foods is followed 
by a warning against the eating of fire. Caution is always given lest too much stress 
should be laid upon the outward ceremonial of the law. Even more dangerous than 
the prohibited foods is the eating of fire, which means the concealing of what is 
revealed in the Book. The concealment in this case means not acting upon the 
teaching of the Book. The Muslims are warned of the danger of being strict in 
external acts of purity while neglecting internal purity. 



2:175' RETALIATION AND BEQUESTS 39 

Resurrection, nor will He purify them; and for them is a painful 
punishment. 175 Those are they who buy error for guidance and 
punishment for forgiveness; how bold they are to challenge the 
Fire! 176 That is because Allah has revealed the Book with truth. 
And surely those who disagree about the Book go far in opposi- 
tion." 

Section 22: Retaliation and Bequests 

177 It is not righteousness that you turn your faces towards 
the East and the West, but righteous is the one who believes in 
Allah, and the Last Day, and the angels e and the Book and the 



a (176) By those who disagree about the Book are meant people who accept 
one part of the Divine Revelation and reject the other, as the Jews and the Chris- 
tians did, the Book in this case standing for the whole of the Divine Revelation 
which is accepted by the Muslims only. Or, the Book stands for the Quran, and 
their disagreement means their rejection of it. 

b (177-1) A warning is given to the Muslims that they should not fall into 
the error into which the previous people fell, who sacrificed the spirit of religion 
for the outward ceremonial. The essence of religion is faith in God and benevo- 
lence towards people. The turning of the face to the East and the West refers to 
the outward act of facing a certain direction when saying prayers. This, though 
necessary, should not be taken as the real object of prayer, which is in fact meant 
to enable one to hold communion with the Divine Being and to imbue oneself with 
Divine morals as explained further on. 

c (177-2) A belief in angels is one of the basic principles of Islam. This 
belief is accepted generally in all monotheistic religions. As in the case of all 
other principles of faith, Islam has pointed out a certain significance underlying 
the belief in angels. There are two attractions placed in humans — the attraction 
to good or to rise up to higher spheres of virtue, and the attraction to evil or to 
stoop down to a kind of low, bestial life. If we respond to the attraction for good 
we are following the angel or the Holy Spirit, and if we respond to the attraction 
for evil we are following the devil. Our belief in angels carries, therefore, the sig- 
nificance that whenever we feel a tendency to do good we should at once obey 
that call. It does not simply mean that we should admit that there are angels. This 
is clear from the fact that not only are we not required to believe in devils, whose 
existence is as certain as that of the angels, but we are plainly told that we should 
disbelieve in the devils (2:256). As a disbelief in the devil means that we should 
repel the attraction for evil, so a belief in angels means that we should follow the 
inviter to good.

prophets, and gives away wealth out of love for Him to the near 
of kin and the orphans and the needy and the traveller and to those 
who ask and to set slaves free c and keeps up prayer and gives the 
due charity; and the performers of their promise when they make a 
promise, and the patient in distress and affliction and in the time 
of conflict. These are they who are truthful; and these are they 
who keep their duty. 

178 O you who believe, retaliation is prescribed for you in the 
matter of the slain: the free for the free, and the slave for the slave, 
and the female for the female. 2 But if remission is made to one by 
his (aggrieved) brother, prosecution (for blood-money) should be 
according to usage, and payment to him in a good manner/ This 
is an alleviation from your Lord and a mercy. Whoever exceeds 
the limit after this, will have a painful punishment. 179 And there is 
life for you in retaliation, you people of understanding, that you 
may guard yourselves. 



a (177-3) The Book stands for Divine Revelation in general or the scriptures 
of all the prophets. 

b (177-4) The love of Allah is here, as in many other places in the Quran, 
stated to be the true incentive to all deeds of righteousness. 

c (177-5) The basis was thus laid down for the abolition of slavery. 

d (177-6) The performance of promise on the part of individuals as well as 
of nations is one of the first essentials of the welfare of humanity, and hence the 
stress laid upon it by the Quran. Faithlessness to treaties and pledges on the part 
of nations has wrought the greatest havoc on humanity. Just as no society can 
prosper until its individual members are true to their mutual agreements and 
promises to each other, so humanity at large can never have peace unless the 
nations are true to their agreements. 

e (178-1) The Jewish law of retaliation is greatly modified in Islam, being 
limited only to cases of murder, while among the Jews it extended to all cases of 
grievous hurt. The words retaliation is prescribed for you in the matter of the 
slain mean that the murderer should be put to death. The pre-Islamic Arabs used 
in certain cases to insist, when the person killed was of noble descent, upon the 
execution of others besides the murderer. The Quran abolished this custom. 

/(178-2) There may be circumstances which alleviate the guilt. In such 
cases the murderer may be made to pay a fine to the relatives of the murdered 
person. Such money is called diyat or blood-money. A comparison with 4:92 makes it 
clear that when homicide is not intentional, blood-money may be paid. 



2:180' FASTING 41 

180 It is prescribed for you, when death approaches one of 
you, if he leaves behind wealth for parents and near relatives, to 
make a bequest in a kindly manner; it is incumbent upon the 
dutiful." 181 Then whoever changes it after he has heard it, the sin 
of it is only upon those who change it. Surely Allah is Hearing, 
Knowing. 182 But if one fears a wrong or a sinful course on the part 
of the testator, and effects an agreement between the parties, there 
is no blame on him. Surely Allah is Forgiving, Merciful. 

Section 23: Fasting 

183 O you who believe, fasting is prescribed for you, as it was 
prescribed for those before you, so that you may guard against 
evil. 184 For a certain number of days. But whoever among you is 
sick or on a journey, (he shall fast) a (like) number of other days. 
And those who find it extremely hard may effect redemption by 
feeding a poor one. c So whoever does good spontaneously, it is 
better for him; and that you fast is better for you if you know. 



a (180) Some commentators hold the opinion that the direction here, to make 
a bequest, is abrogated by 4:1 1 which fixes the shares of the heirs of the deceased 
person. However, that verse clearly recognizes the validity of any bequest that 
may have been made. In practice, however, traced to the Prophet himself, the right 
to make a will has been subject to the condition that not more than a third of the 
property shall be bequeathed, and that those who take as heirs shall not be entitled 
to take under the bequest. Hence, this verse really speaks of bequests made for 
charitable purposes and not of bequests to heirs. 

b (183) Fasting is a religious institution almost as universal as prayer, and in 
Islam it is one of the five fundamental practical ordinances. "Fasting has in all ages 
and among all nations been an exercise much in use in times of mourning, sorrow 
and affliction" (Cruden's Bible Concordance). But Islam has introduced quite a 
new meaning into the institution of fasting. It becomes an institution for the 
improvement of the moral and spiritual condition of man. This is plainly stated in 
the concluding words: so that you may guard against evil. The object is that man 
may learn how he can shun evil, and hence fasting in Islam does not mean simply 
abstaining from food, but from every kind of evil. Abstention from food is only a 
step to make a person realize that if he can, in obedience to Divine injunctions, 
abstain from that which is otherwise lawful, how much more necessary is it 
to abstain from the evil ways which are forbidden by God. 

c (184) The first two classes exempted are: (a) those who are sick and 
(b) those journeying. Both are required to fast afterwards when sickness or

and the Criterion.^ So whoever of you is present in the month, he 
shall fast in it, and whoever is sick or on a journey, (he shall fast) 
a (like) number of other days. Allah desires ease for you, and He 
does not desire hardship for you, and (He desires) that you should 
complete the number and that you should exalt the greatness of 
Allah for having guided you and that you may give thanks. 

186 And when My servants ask you concerning Me, surely I 
am near. I answer the prayer of the supplicant when he calls on 
Me, so they should hear My call and believe in Me that they may

journey ends. What is sickness or journey every person can determine for himself. 
Someone who needs a medicine or is unable to bear the hardship of hunger or 
thirst should not fast. In journeying again, whether one can easily fast or not is the 
determining factor. The third exception is in the case of those who find it 
extremely difficult to bear the hardship of fasting. Such people may effect a 
redemption by giving food daily to a poor person. This exception covers the case 
of pregnant women, women who are breast feeding infants, old people who cannot 
bear fasting; also such sick people whose sickness is prolonged and such people 
whose journey extends over the whole year. 

a (185-1) The revelation of the Quran commenced in the month of Ramadan, 
the ninth month of the Arabian year; hence, the month of Ramadan is particularly 
spoken of as being the month in which the Quran was revealed. 

b (185-2) Elsewhere we are told that it was revealed on the Lailat al-Qadr or 
the Night of Majesty (97:1), a well-known night in the month of Ramadan, being 
the 25th or 27th or 29th night of that month. By the revelation of the Quran in the 
month of Ramadan is therefore meant the commencement of its revelation. 
The month of Ramadan is thus a memorial of the revelation of the Quran. 

c (185-3) Firstly, the Quran is a "guidance" for all people, and therefore it 
contains teachings suitable and sufficient for all people in all countries and ages. 
Secondly, it contains "clear proofs" to demonstrate the truth of what it asserts. 
Thirdly, it contains arguments which afford a "criterion" (Arabic \furqan), separa- 
ting truth from falsehood. 

d (186) This verse speaks of the nearness of God to man and of the accept- 
ance of his prayers to show that fasting is a spiritual exercise and it brings about 
spiritual awakening in man. Fasting undoubtedly awakens a living consciousness 
of the existence of God in the mind. This is the idea underlying the words: "When 
My servants ask you concerning Me". A real and earnest search for God is raised 



2:187* FASTING 43 

187 It is made lawful for you to have intercourse with your 
wives on the night of the fast. They are an apparel for you and you 
are an apparel for them. a Allah knows that you acted unjustly to 
yourselves, so He turned to you in mercy and removed (the burden) 
from you. So now be in contact with them and seek what Allah 
has ordained for you, and eat and drink until the whiteness of the 
day becomes distinct from the blackness of the night at dawn, then 
complete the fast till nightfall/ and do not touch them while you 
keep to the mosques. These are the limits of Allah, so do not go 
near them. Thus does Allah make clear His messages for people 
that they may keep their duty. 188 And do not swallow up your pro- 
perty among yourselves by false means, nor seek to gain access 
thereby to the judges, so that you may swallow up a part of the 
property of (other) people wrongfully while you know. 6 

in the mind through fasting. "I am near" is the reply to that inner search. And then 
follow the words: "I answer the prayer of the supplicant when he calls on Me". 
God is near, but that consciousness only raises the further desire to get nearer and 
nearer to Him. For that man calls on God; he prays to Him to draw him closer and 
closer to Himself. And he is told that God accepts this prayer. 

a (187-1) First, the sex instinct is classed with hunger and thirst. It is a natural 
desire and one could not live without satisfying it. And then in these words — 
your wives are an apparel for you and you are an apparel for them — we are told 
that while satisfying a natural desire, the relation of husband and wife has higher 
ends in view. They serve as a garment for each other, i.e., they are a means of 
protection, comfort and even embellishment for each other, and the weakness of 
one is made up by the strength of the other. 

b (187-2) Muslims at first thought that it was illegal to have intercourse with 
their wives even at night, on the days during which they kept fasts. These words 
made it clear that this was permitted during the nights of fasting as the satisfaction 
of hunger and thirst was permitted. 

c (187-3) In countries where the days are sometimes very long, the time of 
fasting may be measured in accordance with the length of an ordinary day, or 
where practicable postpone the fasts to shorter days of about normal length. 

d (187-4) Those people are meant who cut themselves off from all worldly 
connections during the last ten days of Ramadan, passing day and night in the 
mosques. This practice, known as I'tikaf is voluntary and not obligatory. 

e (188) The command to abstain from illegally taking other people's pro- 
perty is a fitting sequel to the injunction relating to fasting, for by fasting a person 
abstains from using what he has a legal right to, simply in obedience to Divine

Section 24: Fighting in Defence 

189 They ask you about the new moons. Say: They are times 
appointed for people, and (for) the pilgrimage. a And it is not 
righteousness that you enter houses by their backs, but he is 
righteous who keeps his duty. And go into houses by their doors; 6 
and keep your duty to Allah, that you may be successful. 

190 And fight in the way of Allah against those who fight 
against you but do not be aggressive. Surely Allah does not love 
the aggressors. c 191 And kill them wherever you find them, and 
drive them out from where they drove you out, and persecution is 
worse than slaughter/ And do not fight with them at the Sacred 



commandments. Fasting, in fact, enables one to control his passions, and the more 
the passions are mastered, the less the greed for illegal acquisition. 

a (189-1) The reference in "new moons" is in particular to the four months 
of the year which the Arabs observed as sacred (the 11th, 12th, 1st and 7th). All 
hostilities ceased and peace was established throughout the land; thus trade was 
carried on without molestation. The pilgrimage to Makkah was also performed 
during these months. 

b (189-2) Entering by the back indicates turning aside from the right course, 
while entering by the doors signifies sticking to the right course. This also refers 
to a superstitious custom of pre-Islamic Arabs, whereby when one of them failed to 
attain his objective he would not enter his house by the door but by the back. 

c (190) This is one of the earliest revelations permitting Muslims to fight. It 
is remarkable that fighting in the way of Allah is here expressly limited to fighting 
in defence. Muslims were required to fight in the way of Allah, but they could 
fight only against those who waged war on them. Exactly the same limitation is 
placed on what was in all probability the first revelation permitting fighting: 
"Permission (to fight) is given to those on whom war is made because they are 
oppressed" (22:39). Muslims were allowed to take up the sword only as a measure 
of self-defence. The enemies of Islam, being unable to suppress Islam by perse- 
cution, and seeing that Islam was now safe at Madinah and gaining strength, took 
up the sword to annihilate it. No course was left for the Muslims but either to be 
swept off the face of the earth or take up the sword in defence against an enemy 
which was immensely stronger. 

d (191-1) The words kill them refer to those with whom fighting is enjoined 
in the previous verse, who waged war upon the Muslims. 

e (191-2) The word translated as "persecution" is fitna. Ibn Umar explained 
the w 'or d fitna when he said: "And there were very few Muslims [in the begin- 
ning], so a man used to be persecuted on account of his religion: they either

Mosque until they fight with you in it; so if they fight you (in it), 
kill them. Such is the recompense of the disbelievers. 192 But if 
they cease, then surely Allah is Forgiving, Merciful." 193 And fight 
them until there is no persecution, and religion is only for Allah. 
But if they cease, then there should be no hostility except against 
the oppressors. 194 The sacred month for the sacred month, and 
retaliation (is allowed) in sacred things. c Whoever then acts 
aggressively against you, inflict injury on him according to the 
injury he has inflicted on you and keep your duty to Allah, and 
know that Allah is with those who keep their duty. 195 And spend 
in the way of Allah and do not cast yourselves to destruction with 
your own hands and do good (to others). Surely Allah loves the 
doers of good. 

196 And accomplish the pilgrimage and the visit for Allah. 
But if you are prevented, (send) whatever offering is easy to 
obtain; and do not shave your heads until the offering reaches its 
destination. Then whoever among you is sick or has an ailment of 
the head, (he may effect) a compensation by fasting or (giving in) 
charity or sacrificing. And when you are secure, whoever profits 
by combining the visit with the pilgrimage (should take) whatever 
offering is easy to obtain. But he who cannot find (an offering) 
should fast for three days during the pilgrimage and for seven days 

murdered him or subjected him to tortures until Islam became predominant, then 
there was aofitna " (Bukhari, 65.2:30). 

a (192) Note the clemency of the Islamic fighting injunctions. Muslims were 
to sheathe their swords if the enemy desisted from fighting. 

b (193) When persecution ceases, and people are not forced to accept or 
renounce a religion, then there should be no more fighting. If they cease persecu- 
tion, Muslims are at once to stop fighting against them, and hostilities are not to 
be continued against any except the aggressors. 

c (194) This is similar to what is said in v. 191 regarding the Sacred Mosque. 
The pre-Islamic Arabs observed four months in the year as sacred, in which 
hostilities ceased and peace was established throughout the land. If the opponents 
violated the sacred months by attacking the Muslims first in those months, the 
Muslims were permitted to fight against them in the sacred months. And generally 
retaliation within the limits of the original act of aggression is permitted in the 
case of all sacred objects.

when you return. These are ten (days) complete. This is for him 
whose family is not present in the Sacred Mosque. And keep your 
duty to Allah, and know that Allah is Severe in retribution." 

Section 25: The Pilgrimage 

197 The months of the pilgrimage are well known; so who- 
ever determines to perform pilgrimage in them, there shall be 
no immodest speech, nor abusing, nor altercation in the pilgri- 
mage. And whatever good you do, Allah knows it. And make 
provision for yourselves, the best provision being to keep one's 
duty. And keep your duty to Me, you people of understanding. 
198 It is no sin for you that you seek the bounty of your Lord. e So 
when you press on from Arafat, remember Allah near the Holy 



a (196) The two subjects of war and pilgrimage are linked because Muslims 
were free at Madinah to perform all the religious ordinances required by Islam, 
but they were not free to perform the pilgrimage, their Spiritual Centre, Makkah, 
being in the possession of their enemies who were at war with them. The "visit" 
or 'umrah may be performed at any time, whilst the "pilgrimage" or hajj can only 
be performed at a particular time of the year. The pilgrimage represents the last 
stage in the progress of the spiritual pilgrim. The first requirement of the pilgri- 
mage, ihram, represents the severance of all worldly connections for the love of 
God. All costly dresses in which the inner self is so often mistaken for the out- 
ward appearance, are cast off, and the pilgrim has only two seamless wrappers to 
cover himself. The other important requirement is making circuits round the 
Ka'bah, called tawaf, and running between the Safa and the Marwah, called sa 'y, 
and both these are external manifestations of that fire of Divine love which has 
been kindled within the heart, so that like the true lover, the pilgrim makes 
circuits round the house of his beloved One. 

b (197) The pilgrimage represents the final stage of spiritual progress, and 
hence the pilgrim is told not to speak words which should be a source of annoy- 
ance to anybody. Perfect love of God requires perfect peace with fellow beings; 
hence no offence should be caused to anyone. The doing of good to others is re- 
commended instead in the words whatever good you do, Allah knows it. 

c (198-1) Seeking the bounty of the Lord here stands for trading. What is 
meant is that there is no harm in seeking an increase of wealth by trading in 
Makkah in the pilgrimage season. 

d (198-2) 'Arafat is the place where the pilgrims assemble on the 9th of the 
month of Dhii-l-Hiijah, towards the close of the pilgrimage. Here the vast gather- 
ing from all countries and nations clad in one dress, with one utterance, labbaika

Monument," and remember Him as He has guided you, though 
before that you were certainly in error. 199 Then hasten on from 
where the people hasten on, and ask the forgiveness of Allah. 
Surely Allah is Forgiving, Merciful. 

200 And when you have performed your devotions, extol 
Allah as you extolled your fathers, rather a stronger extolling/ 
But there are some people who say: Our Lord, give us (good) in 
the world. And for such there is no portion in the Hereafter. 
201 And there are some among them who say: Our Lord, grant us 
good in this world and good in the Hereafter, and save us from the 
punishment of the Fire. d 202 For those there is a portion on account 
of what they have earned. And Allah is Swift in reckoning. 203 And 
remember Allah during the appointed days. Then whoever hastens 
off in two days, it is no sin for him; and whoever stays behind, it 
is no sin for him, for one who keeps his duty. 6 And keep your duty 
to Allah, and know that you will be gathered together to Him. 

Allah-umma labbaika (here I am, O Allah, in Your Presence), declares the glory 
of God. The word 'Arafat is derived from 'arafa, meaning he knew, or acquainted 
himself with, a thing, and there is undoubtedly a reference in this name to the fact 
that here people feel truly the august Divine presence. 

a (198-3) This is the place known as Muzdalafah, or the ground bordering on 
it, where the pilgrims stop for the night after their return from Arafat on the eve- 
ning of the 9th Dhu-l-Hijiah. 

b (199) The Quraish and the Kananah used to stay at Muzdalafah, thinking it 
beneath their dignity to join other pilgrims in going to the plain of Arafat. As all 
distinctions were levelled by Islam, they were told to consider themselves on a par 
with others 

c (200) In pre-Islamic times people used to boast among themselves of the 
greatness of their fathers after they had performed the pilgrimage. The Quran for- 
bade people to boast of the greatness of their fathers, and told them to celebrate 
the praise of Allah instead. 

d (201) This is the true Muslim's prayer. As he is taught to pray for both the 
good of this life and that of the next, so he should exert himself to attain good in 
this life as well as in the Hereafter. 

e (203) The appointed days are the three days following the day of Sacrifice, 
and are called the days of Tashrlq. Ordinarily pilgrims leave on the afternoon of 
the last day of Tashrlq days, but they are allowed to leave on the evening of the 
second day.

204 And among people is he whose speech about the life of 
this world pleases you, and he calls Allah to witness as to what is 
in his heart, yet he is the most violent of adversaries. 205 And when 
he holds authority, he makes effort in the land to cause mischief in 
it and destroy crops and offspring; and Allah does not love 
mischief. 206 And when it is said to him, Be careful of your duty to 
Allah, pride carries him off to sin — so hell is sufficient for him. 
And certainly evil is the resting-place. a 207 And among people is 
he who sells himself to seek the pleasure of Allah. And Allah is 
Compassionate to the servants. 

208 O you who believe, enter into complete peace and do not 
follow the footsteps of the devil. Surely he is your open enemy. 
209 But if you slip after clear arguments have come to you, then 
know that Allah is Mighty, Wise. 210 They only wait that Allah 
should come to them in the shadows of the clouds with angels, 
and the matter has (already) been decided. And to Allah are (all) 
matters returned. 

Section 26: Trials and Tribulations 

211 Ask the Children of Israel how many a clear sign We 
gave them! And whoever changes the favour of Allah after it has 
come to him, then surely Allah is Severe in retribution. 212 The 
life of this world is made to seem attractive to those who 
disbelieve, and they mock those who believe. And those who keep 
their duty will be above them on the day of Resurrection. And 
Allah gives to whom He pleases without measure. 



a (206) Mihad ("resting-place") means a cradle, and also what a man has 
prepared for himself. Hell is a thing which a man prepares for himself; and for a 
new spiritual growth in the Hereafter in the case of those who retarded that 
growth in this world, it serves the same purpose as the cradle for a child. Else- 
where hell is called an umm or mother (101:9). 

b (210) The coming of Allah stands for the coming of the threatened punish- 
ment for those who wanted to annihilate Islam. The matter has already been 
decided, because it was repeatedly made clear in the earliest revelations that all 
opposition to Islam would perish. 

c (211) The favour of Allah is the Quran and its change implies its rejection. 



2:213' TRIALS AND TRIBULATIONS 49 

213 Mankind is a single nation. " So Allah raised prophets as 
bearers of good news and as warners, and He revealed with them 
the Book with truth, that it might judge between people in that in 
which they differed. And none but the very people who were 
given it differed about it after clear arguments had come to them, 
envying one another/ So Allah has guided by His will those who 
believe to the truth about which they differed. And Allah guides 
whom He pleases to the right path. 214 0r do you think that you 
will enter the Garden, while there has not yet come upon you the 
like of what befell those who have passed away before you. 
Distress and affliction befell them and they were shaken violently, 
so that the Messenger and those who believed with him said: 
When will the help of Allah come? Now surely the help of Allah 
is near! e 



a (213-1) The oneness of humanity is a truth on which the Quran lays the 
greatest stress. They are sometimes told that they have all been "created of a single 
being" (4:1); again that they are all descended from the same parents (49:13); still 
again that they are as it were dwellers in one home, having the same earth as a 
resting-place and the same heaven as a canopy (2:22). Hence also the conclusion 
that prophets were raised among all nations which is conveyed in the words that 
follow. 

b (213-2) As all people are a single nation (umma), God, too, has been 
revealing Himself to all. This Law of Divine Revelation has, we are told, found 
expression through prophets, to every one of whom a revealed Book was given to 
show them the right way. 

c (213-3) The universal law expressed here is that corruption followed gui- 
dance. As time passed on, the very people to whom the Book was given so that 
they might follow it, went against it. Thus, though a prophet had been raised in 
every nation, yet every nation had forsaken the right way. Differences again arose 
which necessitated the advent of another prophet. Hence it was necessary to raise 
a prophet who should show the right way to all nations, and this is what is stated 
in the words that follow. 

d (213-4) Allah's guiding those who believe refers to the raising of the 
Prophet Muhammad, through whom Muslims were guided to the right path, to the 
truth, regarding which differences had arisen among all people. If a prophet was 
needed by every nation to settle its own differences, one was surely now needed 
to settle the differences of the various nations. Thus among the different national 
religions of the world, Islam occupies the position of an international religion. 

e (214) This verse inculcates faith and perseverance under the hardest trials 



50 2. THE COW • 2 : 215 

215 They ask you as to what they should spend. Say: What- 
ever wealth you spend, it is for the parents and the near of kin and 
the orphans and the needy and the traveller. And whatever good 
you do, Allah surely is Knower of it. 

216 Fighting is ordained for you, though it is disliked by you; 
and it may be that you dislike a thing while it is good for you, and 
it may be that you love a thing while it is harmful for you; and 
Allah knows while you do not know." 

Section 27: Miscellaneous Questions 

217 They ask you about fighting in the sacred month. Say: 
Fighting in it is a grave (offence). And hindering (people) from 
Allah's way and denying Him and the Sacred Mosque and turning 
its people out of it, are still graver with Allah; and persecution is 
graver than slaughter. And they will not cease fighting you until 
they turn you back from your religion, if they can. 6 And whoever 
of you turns back from his religion, then he dies while an un- 
believer — these it is whose deeds are fruitless in this world and 
the Hereafter. e And they are the companions of the Fire: in it they 



and is an indication of the Prophet's own unequalled endurance and faith. It refers 
not only to the great trials and hardships which Muslims had already suffered at 
Makkah and the privations which they had to undergo in their exile, but more 
particularly to the hardships which were yet in store for them, and which they 
could clearly see in the massing of all forces that could be used to annihilate them. 

a (216) Muslims were too weak to carry on the struggle against the mighty 
forces that were bent upon their destruction, and they disliked the war. A picture 
of distresses and afflictions to which the few converts to Islam were subjected is 
drawn in v. 214. They were few in numbers, poor, exiled, and distressed, yet it 
became inevitable that they should fight in self-defence or they would be des- 
troyed. It was their utter weakness and the enormous disparity of numbers that 
made them dislike the fighting. 

b (217-1) The unbelievers took up the sword to force the Muslims back into 
unbelief and they were determined to carry on the war until they gained this end. 
Note the words they will not cease fighting you until they turn you back from your 
religion, if they can, which disprove the false allegation that the Muslims started 
war to convert the unbelievers by force. 

c (217-2) The persons spoken of here are the apostates. A wrong impression 
exists that those who apostatize from Islam are to be put to death. This is entirely

will abide. 218 Those who believed and those who fled (their homes) 
and strove hard in Allah's way — these surely hope for the mercy 
of Allah. And Allah is Forgiving, Merciful. 

219 They askjou about intoxicants" and games of chance. 
Say: In both of them is a great sin and (some) advantage for 
people, and their sin is greater than their advantage. And they ask 
you as to what they should spend. Say: What you can spare. Thus 
does Allah make clear to you the messages that you may ponder 
220 on this world and the Hereafter. And they ask you concerning 
the orphans. c Say: To set right their affairs is good; and if you mix 
with them, they are your brethren. And Allah knows him who 



untrue. What is stated here is that the opponents of Islam exerted themselves to 
their utmost to turn back the Muslims from their faith by their cruel persecutions, 
and therefore if a Muslim actually went back to unbelief he would be a loser in 
this life as well as in the next, because the desertion of Islam would not only 
deprive him of spiritual advantages, but also of the physical advantages which 
must accrue to the Muslims through the ultimate triumph of Islam. Neither here 
nor anywhere else in the Quran is there even a hint at the infliction of capital or 
any other punishment on the apostate. In the matter of religion, the Quran gives 
perfect freedom to all to adopt whatever religion they like: "And say: The Truth is 
from your Lord; so whoever wishes, let him believe, and whoever wishes, let him 
disbelieve" (18:29). 

a (219-1) The word khamr used here includes all intoxicating substances. 
The prohibition spoken of here as regards both intoxicating liquors and games of 
chance is made plainer in 5:90. The prohibition of intoxicants in connection with 
the mention of war shows that Islam wanted to inspire true courage into its 
followers and disliked the reckless daring which a man shows under the influence 
of intoxicating liquors and which has so often led to atrocities in wars. The 
constant fighting of Arab tribes, one against the other, had made the habit of drink 
second nature to the Arab. Intoxicating liquors were the chief feature of their 
feasts, and the habit of drink was not considered an evil, nor had there ever been a 
temperance movement among them. Yet one word of the Holy Quran was suffi- 
cient to blot out all traces of it from among a whole nation. 

b (219-2) Intoxicants and gambling are both declared in 5:91 as causing 
"enmity and hatred among you", and a society the members of which are imbued 
with feelings of hatred and enmity towards each other could never prosper. 

c (220-1) From the earliest, the revelations of the Quran always speak of the 
orphans, the needy, and the slaves in the kindest words, and lay special stress on 
helping and feeding them. See 90: 11-16 and other places. 

d (220-2) Orphans are not to be treated as a separate class, and they should

makes mischief from him who sets (affairs) right. And if Allah 
pleased, He would have made matters difficult for you. Surely 
Allah is Mighty, Wise. 

221 And do not marry female idolaters until they believe; and 
certainly a believing maid is better than a female idolater even 
though she please you. Nor give (believing women) in marriage to 
idolaters until they believe, and certainly a believing slave is 
better than an idolater, even though he please you. These invite to 
the Fire and Allah invites to the Garden and to forgiveness by His 
will and He makes clear His messages to people that they may be 
mindful. 

Section 28: Divorce 

222 And they ask j^ou about menstruation." Say: It is harmful; 
so keep aloof from women during menstrual discharge and do not 
approach them (for intercourse) until they are clean. But when they 
have cleansed themselves, go to them as Allah has commanded 
you. Surely Allah loves those who turn much (to Him), and He 
loves those who purify themselves. 223 Your wives are a tilth for 
you, so go to your tilth when you like, and send (good deeds) 
beforehand for yourselves; and have regard for your duty to Allah 
and know that you will meet Him. e And give good news to the 
believers. 



not be treated as living on the charity of others; they must be treated as brethren. 

a (222-1) Just as war made many children orphans, it made many women 
widows, but questions relating to widowhood and divorce being somewhat analo- 
gous, the two questions are treated together here and further on. 

b (222-2) The word used (adh-an) signifies anything that causes a slight 
harm. It is not, however, the menstrual discharge that is called harmful here but 
having sexual relations while the woman is in that condition. The Jewish law con- 
tains a similar prohibition in Leviticus 18:19 and 20:18, though Jewish practice 
rendered it necessary that the separation between husband and wife should be 
complete. In Islam, it is limited to the cessation of sexual intercourse as the 
answer here shows. 

c (223) This verse shows that the real object of marital relations is not 
simply the satisfaction of sexual desires. (Editor's Note: The comparison of 
women to the land that is tilled is to show that it is through them that the crop of

224 And do not make Allah by your oaths a hindrance to your 
doing good and keeping your duty and making peace between

you to account for what is vain in your oaths, but He will call you 
to account for what your hearts have earned. And Allah is Forgiv- 
ing, Forbearing. 226 Those who swear that they will not have sexual 
relations with their wives should wait four months; e then if they 
go back, Allah is Forgiving, Merciful. 227 And if they resolve on a 
divorce/ Allah is surely Hearing, Knowing. 228 Divorced women 



the next generation of human beings grows and develops, both physically and in 
character. Men are also told here to do some act of moral goodness before 
approaching their wives sexually, and to have regard for duty to God which stands 
for having regard for one's duties towards others as required by God. Thus the 
husband is required to be mindful also of moral duty and responsibility in the 
matter of sexual relations with his wife, so that it should not be merely an occasion 
for him to gratify his lust selfishly with no regard for moral goodness or the rights 
of his wife.) 

a (224) This verse refers to the pre-Islamic Arab custom of Tla ', a way of 
temporarily putting off the wife which was effected by an oath in Allah's name 
not to have sexual relations with her. The result of this was that the husband 
considered himself free from all marital obligations. The first step to bring about a 
reform in the relations of husband and wife was that this practice was abolished. It 
is in reference to this that the taking of oaths against the doing of good to others is 
prohibited. The fulfilment of marital obligations is thus referred to as the doing of 
good and observance of duty and making peace between people. But the subject is 
generalized and the taking of all oaths to forbid oneself the doing of good or 
fulfilment of obligations is prohibited. See also 66:2 footnote. 

b (225) By vain oaths are meant unintentional or thoughtless oaths in ordinary 
conversation, and by what the hearts have earned is meant an oath intentionally 
taken. 

c (226) Ila' signifies an oath by a man that he shall not approach his wife. In 
pre-Islamic times the Arabs used to take such oaths frequently, and as the period 
of suspension was not limited, the wife was compelled sometimes to pass her 
whole life having neither the position of a wife nor that of a divorced woman free 
to marry elsewhere. The Quran declares that if the husband does not reassert 
conjugal relations within four months, the wife shall be divorced. Cases in which 
husbands desert wives, having neither conjugal relations with them nor divorcing 
them, must be dealt with practically as amounting to Tla ', so that after four months 
the wife should be free if she wants a divorce. 

d (227) The Islamic law of divorce is elastic and does not strictly limit the 
causes of divorce. Divorce is allowed if sufficient reason exists, but the right is to 



54 2. THE COW • 2 : 229 

should keep themselves in waiting for three courses." And it is not 
lawful for them to conceal what Allah has created in their wombs, 
if they believe in Allah and the Last Day. And their husbands have 
a better right to take them back in the meanwhile if they wish for 
reconciliation. And women have rights similar to those against them 
in a just manner, c and men are a degree above them. And Allah is 
Mighty, Wise. 

Section 29: Divorce 

229 Divorce may be (pronounced) twice; e then keep (them) in 
good fellowship or let (them) go with kindness/ And it is not lawful 

be exercised under exceptional circumstances. A wife can claim a divorce accord- 
ing to the Islamic law, which was not a right conferred on her by Jewish and 
Christian laws on divorce as formulated in Deuteronomy and Matthew. 

a (228-1) The period of waiting, or 'iddat, forms the first condition in the 
Islamic law of divorce. But for cases in which marriage is not consummated, no 
period of waiting is necessary; see 33:49. 

b (228-2) These words give a clear right to the parties to effect a reconcilia- 
tion and re-establish conjugal relations within the period of waiting. No special 
procedure is necessary for this but both the divorce and the reconciliation must 
take place in the presence of witnesses. If, however, the 'iddat is over and no 
reconciliation has been effected, the relation of husband and wife can be re- 
established by remarriage, which right is given to the parties by v. 232. 

c (228-3) The rights of women against their husbands are here stated to be 
similar to those which the husbands have against their wives. The change in this 
respect was really a revolutionizing one, for the Arabs hitherto regarded women 
as mere property. Women were now declared to have rights similar to those which 
were exercised against them. The equality of the rights of women with those of 
men was never previously recognized by any nation or any reformer. 

d (228-4) The statement that "men are a degree above them" does not nullify 
the rights asserted in the previous passage. The words are added simply to show 
that the husband is the head of the household. 

e (229-1) The divorce spoken of here is the revocable divorce of v. 228, after 
which a reconciliation may be effected in the waiting period. Islam allows a 
revocable divorce on two occasions only, so that the period of waiting in each of 
these two cases might serve as a period of temporary separation during which 
conjugal relations could be re-established. Remarriage of the same parties is 
allowed after the lapse of the waiting period. 

/ (229-2) The husband must make his choice after the second divorce either 
to retain the wife permanently or to bring about a final separation. The object of a

for you to take any part of what you have given them," unless both 
fear that they cannot keep within the limits of Allah. Then if you 
fear that they cannot keep within the limits of Allah, there is no 
blame on them for what she gives up to become free thereby. 
These are the limits of Allah, so do not exceed them; and whoever 
exceeds the limits of Allah, these are the wrongdoers. 

230 So if he divorces her (the third time), c she shall not be 
lawful to him afterwards until she marries another husband. If he 
divorces her, there is no blame on them both if they return to each 
other (by marriage), if they think that they can keep within the 
limits of Allah. And these are the limits of Allah which He makes 
clear for a people who know. 



true marriage union is indicated in the simple words keep them in good fellowship. 
If good fellowship is entirely absent the only remedy is to let the woman go with 
kindness. 

a (229-3) The full payment of the dowry to the wife by the husband is another 
condition relating to the Islamic law of divorce. (This is the nuptial gift the hus- 
band owes the wife, as agreed between them at the time of marriage.) 

b (229-4) These words give the wife a right to claim a divorce. Islam gives 
the wife the right to claim a divorce even on grounds of disliking her husband, if 
she is willing to forgo the whole or part of her dowry (i.e., nuptial gift from the 
husband). The words unless both fear that they cannot keep within the limits of 
Allah mean their inability to perform towards each other their marital obligations 
and to maintain good fellowship. The words if you fear refer to the properly cons- 
tituted authorities and this shows that the authorities can interfere in the matter. 

c (230-1) The words refer to the "letting go with kindness" of the previous 
verse, and hence by divorce here is meant the irrevocable divorce pronounced a 
third time, i.e., after there has been a divorce and a restitution of conjugal rights 
twice. 

d (230-2) When the wife has been divorced twice, after each of which 
reconciliation has been effected and has failed, the third divorce becomes irrevo- 
cable. It is not simply by repeating the pronouncement of divorce three times that 
the third pronouncement becomes irrevocable. A divorce should actually have 
taken place twice, followed each time by reconciliation, then and only then the 
third divorce becomes irrevocable. It would, in fact, be very rare. After the third 
irrevocable divorce, the husband cannot remarry the divorced wife until she has 
been married elsewhere and divorced; but it must be a genuine marriage and a 
genuine divorce.

231 And when you divorce women and they reach their 
prescribed time, then retain them with kindness or let them go 
with kindness and do not retain them for injury so that you exceed 
the limits." And whoever does this, he indeed wrongs his own soul. 
And do not take Allah's messages for a mockery,* and remember 
Allah's favour to you, and what He has revealed to you of the 
Book and the Wisdom, instructing you by it. And keep your duty 
to Allah, and know that Allah is the Knower of all things. 

Section 30: Remarriage of Divorced Women and Widows 

232 And when you divorce women and they end their term, 
do not prevent them from marrying their husbands if they agree 
among themselves in a lawful manner. With this is instructed he 
among you who believes in Allah and the Last Day. This is more 
virtuous for you and purer. And Allah knows while you do not 
know. e 233 And mothers shall suckle their children for two whole 
years, for him who desires to complete the time of suckling. And 
their maintenance and their clothing must be borne by the father 



a (231-1) If the husband is proved to give injury to the wife, he cannot retain 
her, and she can claim a divorce. Injury to the wife may be of a general nature or 
one given with the object of compelling her to remit her dowry to obtain a 
divorce. It is for the judge to see that the husband is not taking undue advantage 
of his position. On the other hand, the husband is enjoined to show liberality to 
the divorced wife, and the judge would no doubt see that the injunctions of the 
Quran were observed. It is made clear in 4:35 that decision in matters of divorce 
rests with the judges appointed, not with the husband or the wife. 

b (231-2) The injunctions relating to the kind treatment of women must not 
be taken lightly, we are told here. Retaining women to cause them injury has already 
been declared to be a transgression and emphasis is now laid on the proper obser- 
vance of these injunctions by stating that these are most serious matters relating to 
the welfare of society as a whole. 

c (232) As already stated, when a divorce is pronounced, the conjugal rela- 
tions can be re-established within the period of waiting. Here it is stated that if the 
period of waiting has elapsed, even then the former husband can remarry the 
divorced wife. The decision to re-marry is determined solely by mutual agreement 
between the former husband and wife, on terms of equality with one another. 

d (233) By mothers here are meant in particular, as the context shows, 
women who have been divorced having children to suckle. 



2:234' DIVORCED WOMEN AND WIDOWS 57 

according to usage. No soul shall be burdened beyond its capacity. 
Neither shall a mother be made to suffer harm on account of her 
child, nor a father on account of his child; and a similar duty 
(devolves) on the (father's) heir. But if both desire weaning by 
mutual consent and counsel, there is no blame on them. And if 
you wish to engage a wet-nurse for your children, there is no blame 
on you so long as you pay what you promised according to usage. 
And keep your duty to Allah and know that Allah is Seer of what 
you do. 

234 And (as for) those of you who die and leave wives behind, 
such women should keep themselves in waiting for four months 
and ten days; a when they reach their term, there is no blame on 
you for what they do for themselves in a lawful manner.* And 
Allah is Aware of what you do. 235 And there is no blame on you 
concerning what you speak indirectly in the asking of (such) 
women in marriage or keep (the proposal) concealed within your 
minds. Allah knows that you will have them in your minds, but do 
not give them a promise in secret unless you speak in a lawful 
manner. And do not confirm the marriage tie until the prescribed 
period reaches its end. And know that Allah knows what is in your 
minds, so beware of Him; and know that Allah is Forgiving, 
Forbearing. 

Section 3 1 : Provision for Divorced Women and Widows 

236 There is no blame on you if you divorce women while yet 
you have not touched them, nor appointed for them a portion. And 
provide for them, the wealthy according to his means and the 
restricted one according to his means, a provision according to 
usage. (This is) a duty on the doers of good. c 237 And if you divorce 



a (234-1) The period of waiting in the case of a widow is four months and 
ten days. But in case a divorced woman or a widow is pregnant, the period of 
waiting is extended to the time of delivery (65:4). 

b (234-2) The meaning is that the widow may look out for a husband and 
remarry. {Editor 's Note: The words "what they do for themselves in a lawful 
manner" place decisions about the widow's remarriage entirely in her hands.) 

c (236) The "portion" is the dowry due from the husband, so that even when 



58 2. THE COW • 2 : 238 

them before you have touched them and you have appointed for 
them a portion, (pay) half of what you have appointed unless they 
forgo or he forgoes in whose hand is the marriage tie." And it is 
nearer to dutifulness that you forgo. Nor neglect the giving of free 
gifts between you. Surely Allah is Seer of what you do. 

238 Guard the prayers and the most excellent prayer, and 
stand up truly obedient to Allah. 239 But if you are in danger (say 
your prayers) on foot or on horseback. And when you are secure, 
remember Allah as He has taught you what you did not know. 

240 And those of you who die and leave wives behind, should 
make a bequest in favour of their wives of maintenance for a year 
without turning (them) out. c Then if they themselves go away, 
there is no blame on you for what they do of lawful deeds con- 
cerning themselves. And Allah is Mighty, Wise. 241 And for divorced 
women, provision (must be made) in kindness. This is incumbent 

no dowry has been agreed upon, and marriage has not been consummated, libera- 
lity must be shown to the divorced wife, and some provision should be made for 
her, even though the husband may be in difficult circumstances. 

a (237) The husband is the person in whose hand is the marriage tie. His 
forgoing his due is equivalent to not claiming the half of the dowry which he is 
entitled to by this verse. Note that forgoing on the part of husbands is here stated 
to be the more commendable course. 

b (238) There are several opinions regarding what is meant by the term 
translated above as "the most excellent prayer". Most probably it does not refer to 
any particular prayer and means simply attending to prayer in the most excellent 
form. The guarding of prayers is not simply the observance of the outward form; 
it is both the form and the spirit to which attention is drawn. Prayers are to be said 
at stated times and a particular method is to be observed, but this does not mean 
that the Islamic prayer is devoid of spirit. The external form is needed to bring the 
inner faculty into exercise. As regards the spirit of prayer, attention is called to it 
again and again in the Quran. Elsewhere we are told: "Prayer keeps (one) away 
from indecency and evil" (29:45). In fact, the Quran condemns prayers which are 
devoid of spirit (107:4-6). 

c (240) What the widow obtains under this verse is in addition to the share of 
the deceased husband's property which she inherits under 4:1 1. It is plainly stated 
in 4:12 that anything to be paid under a will shall have precedence of the division 
of the property into shares under that verse. 

d (241) This provision is in addition to the dowry which must be paid to 



2:242* FIGHTING IN THE CAUSE OF TRUTH 59 

on those who have regard for duty. 242 Allah thus makes clear to 
you His messages that you may understand. 

Section 32: Fighting in the Cause of Truth 

243 Have you not considered those who went forth from their 
homes, and they were thousands, for fear of death. Then Allah 
said to them, Die. Then He gave them life." Surely Allah is 
gracious to people, but most people are not grateful. 244 And fight 
in the way of Allah, and know that Allah is Hearing, Knowing. 
245 Who is it that will offer to Allah a goodly gift, so He multiplies 
it to him manifold? And Allah receives and amplifies, e and to Him 
you shall be returned. 

246 Have you not thought of the leaders of the Children of 
Israel after Moses? When they said to a prophet of theirs: Raise up 
for us a king, that we may fight in the way of Allah. He said: 
May it not be that you will not fight if fighting is ordained for 
you? They said: And what reason have we that we should not fight 
in Allah's way and we have indeed been deprived of our homes 
and our children? But when fighting was ordained for them, they 

them. Just as in the previous verse the widow is given an additional benefit, here a 
provision in addition to her dowry is recommended for divorced woman. This 
shows how liberal are the injunctions of the Quran regarding women. 

a (243) The thousands referred to are the Israelites who left Egypt with Moses. 
They left Egypt for fear of death, for death would surely have been their fate if 
they had not emigrated. The next incident in their history referred to here is the 
Divine commandment to them to "die". This is more fully stated in 5:21-26. 
Moses told them to enter the Holy Land "which Allah has ordained for you," but 
they refused and were made to wander about in the wilderness for forty years, so 
that that generation perished. This is also shown by their history as given in the 
Old Testament. It is also meant as a warning for Muslims, who are told that if 
they followed the footsteps of the Israelites, death must be their fate. 

b (244) See 2:190; fighting in Allah's way is equivalent to fighting in 
defence of faith. 

c (245) Allah receives and amplifies means that Allah receives the gift that is 
offered to Him and then amplifies it; in other words, any sacrifice made in the 
cause of Truth is amply rewarded by Allah. 

d (246) The prophet alluded to is Samuel. See 1 Samuel 8:19-20.

turned back, except a few of them. And Allah is Knower of the 
wrongdoers. 247 And their prophet said to them: Allah has raised 
Saul to be a king over you. They said: How can he have kingdom 
over us while we have a greater right to kingdom than he, and he 
has not been granted abundance of wealth? He said: Surely Allah 
has chosen him above you, and has increased him abundantly in 
knowledge and physique. And Allah grants His kingdom to whom 
He pleases. And Allah is Ample-giving, Knowing. 248 And their 
prophet said to them: Surely the sign of his kingdom is that there 
shall come to you the heart in which there is tranquillity from your 
Lord and the best of what the followers of Moses and the followers 
of Aaron have left," the angels bearing it. Surely in this there is a 
sign for you if you are believers. 

Section 33: Fighting in the Cause of Truth 

249 So when Saul set out with the forces, he said: Surely 
Allah will try you with a river. Whoever drinks from it, he is not 
of me, and whoever does not taste it, he is surely of me, except he 
who takes a handful with his hand. But they drank of it except a 
few of them. So when he had crossed it, he and those who 
believed with him, they said: We have today no power against 
Goliath and his forces. Those who were sure that they would meet 
their Lord said: How often has a small group overcome a numerous 
army by Allah's permission! And Allah is with the steadfast. 
250 And when they went out against Goliath and his forces, they 
said: Our Lord, pour out patience on us and make our steps firm 



a (248-1) The word tabut means a chest or a box, but also signifies the heart. 
Tranquillity from the Lord is not a thing which is placed in boxes, but the heart is 
its real repository. On five other occasions the coming down of saklnah, or 
tranquillity, is mentioned in the Quran, and every time it is the heart of the 
Prophet or the faithful that is the recipient of it. The coming of "the heart in which 
there is tranquillity" means the change which came over Saul when he was made 
king: "So it was, when he had turned his back to go from Samuel, that God gave 
him another heart" (1 Samuel 10:9). The best of what the true followers of Moses 
and Aaron left are spiritual blessings, the highest being Divine inspiration. 

b (248-2) The meaning is that the tranquillity and inspiration were borne by 
the angels into the heart of Saul.

and help us against the disbelieving people. 251 So they put them to 
flight by Allah's permission. And David killed Goliath, and Allah 
gave him kingdom and wisdom, and taught him of what He pleased. 
And if it were not for Allah's repelling some people by others, the 
earth would certainly be in a state of disorder; but Allah is full of 
grace to the worlds. 252 These are the messages of Allah — We 
recite them to you with truth; and surely you are one of the 
messengers. 

253 We have made some of these messengers to excel others." 
Among them are they to whom Allah spoke, and some of them He 
exalted by (many) degrees of rank. And We gave clear arguments 
to Jesus son of Mary, and strengthened him with the Holy Spirit. 
And if Allah had pleased, those after them would not have fought 
with one another after clear arguments had come to them, but they 
disagreed; so some of them believed and some of them denied. 
And if Allah had pleased they would not have fought with one 
another, but Allah does what He intends. 

Section 34: Compulsion in Religion forbidden 

254 O you who believe, spend (on good works) out of what 
We have given you before the day comes in which there is no 
bargaining, nor friendship, nor intercession. And the disbelievers 
— they are the wrongdoers. 

255 Allah — there is no god but He, the Ever-living, the Self- 
subsisting by Whom all subsist. Slumber does not overtake Him, 
nor sleep. To Him belongs whatever is in the heavens and what- 
ever is in the earth. Who is he that can intercede with Him but by 
His permission? c He knows what is before them and what is 



a (253-1) This also refers to the excellence of the Prophet Muhammad over 
all other prophets. 

b (253-2) Allah spoke to all, but there were some who were exalted above 
others by many degrees. 

c (255-1) Islam does not recognize the concept that man stands in need of 
any mediator to reconcile him with God, as in the sense of the Christian doctrine. 
The Prophet is the model for his people and in this sense he is called a shafT' or

behind them. And they encompass nothing of His knowledge except 
what He pleases. His knowledge extends over the heavens and the 
earth, and the preservation of them both does not tire Him. And 
He is the Most High, the Great." 

256 There is no compulsion in religion ' — the right way is 
indeed clearly distinct from error. So whoever disbelieves in the 
devil and believes in Allah, he indeed lays hold on the firmest 
handle which shall never break. And Allah is Hearing, Knowing. 
257 Allah is the Friend of those who believe — He brings them out 
of darkness into light. And those who disbelieve, their friends are 
the devils who take them out of light into darkness. They are the 
companions of the Fire; in it they abide. 

Section 35: How Dead Nations are raised to Life 

258 Have you not thought of him who disputed with Abraham 
about his Lord, because Allah had given him kingdom? c When 
Abraham said, My Lord is He Who gives life and causes to die, he 
said: I give life and cause death. Abraham said: Surely Allah causes 

an intercessor. Those who take him for their model are not all equally gifted, nor 
have all equal occasion for spiritual progress, though they exert themselves to 
their utmost. So Divine mercy takes them by the hand and amends are made for 
their shortcomings through the intercession of the Prophet. It is in this sense that 
Islam recognizes the doctrine of intercession in the life after death. 

a (255-2) This is a very well-known verse which goes under the name of 
ayat al-kursT, or the verse of knowledge, because it deals with the all-comprehen- 
sive knowledge of Allah. 

b (256) To all the allegations that the Holy Prophet preached Islam by the 
sword, this verse is a sufficient answer. Being assured of success, Muslims are 
told that when they hold power in their hands their guiding principle should be 
that there should be no compulsion in the matter of religion. The claim that this 
passage was directed only to the early converts and that it was abrogated later on 
is utterly baseless. 

c (258-1) The words "because Allah had given him kingdom" refer to 
Abraham. This is corroborated by 4:54. The Muslims are here told that just as a 
promise is given to them that they will be raised to great eminence, which is equi- 
valent to raising the dead to life, a similar promise was given to Abraham, that 
promise being in fact the basis of the present promise to the Prophet. 

d (258-2) As the discussion arose out of the promise given to Abraham that

the sun to rise from the East, so you make it rise from the West. a 
Thus he who disbelieved was baffled. And Allah does not guide 
the unjust people. 

259 Or like him who passed by a town, and it had fallen in 
upon its roofs. He said: When will Allah give it life after its death? 
So Allah caused him to die for a hundred years, then raised him. 
He said: How long have you remained? He said: I have remained a 
day, or part of a day. He said: No, you have remained a hundred 
years; but look at jour food and drink — years have not passed 
over it! And look at your donkey! That We may make you a sign 
to people. And look at the bones, how We set them together then 
clothe them with flesh. So when it became clear to him, he said: I 
know that Allah is Powerful over all things. 

260 And when Abraham said, My Lord, show me how You 
give life to the dead, He said: Do you not believe? He said: Yes, 
but that my heart may be at ease. He said: Then take four birds, 
then tame them to incline to you, then place on every mountain a 
part of them, then call them, they will come to you flying; and 
know that Allah is Mighty, Wise. e 



his descendants would be made a great nation, it is clear that the reference here is 
to the life and death of nations. 

a (258-3) The disputant belonged to a race of sun-worshippers, and therefore 
if he could give life and cause death, he could control even his deity, the sun, and 
should be able to make it rise from the opposite direction. 

b (259) This refers to Ezekiel's vision as related in Ezekiel, ch. 37. The town 
is Jerusalem. The prophet dying for a hundred years is also an incident of the 
vision, standing symbolically for the death of the Jewish nation or the desolation 
of Jerusalem for almost a hundred years after Jerusalem was taken by Nebuchad- 
nezzar in 599 B.C. The bones were a symbol of the fallen condition of the house 
of Israel. The food and drink of the prophet not showing any influence of years, 
and his donkey still standing by, proves that the hundred years' death was only a 
vision. The vision made him a symbol of the whole Jewish nation, and his symbo- 
lic death for a hundred years represented the sorrows and afflictions of Israel for a 
similar period, after which they were once more to be restored to life. 

c (260) This is a sequel to v. 258, which speaks of the manifestation of 
Allah's power in the life and death of nations. In Genesis 15:8 Abraham is made 
to say, after receiving a promise of the land of Canaan: "Lord God, whereby shall 
I know that I shall inherit it?" The Quranic parallel to this is: "My Lord, show me

Section 36: Spending Money in the Cause of Truth 

261 The parable of those who spend their wealth in the way of 
Allah is as the parable of a grain growing seven ears, in every ear 
a hundred grains. a And Allah multiplies (further) for whom He 
pleases. And Allah is Ample-giving, Knowing. 262 Those who spend 
their wealth in the way of Allah, then do not follow up what they 
have spent with reproach or injury, their reward is with their Lord, 
and they shall have no fear nor shall they grieve. 263 A kind word 
with forgiveness is better than charity followed by injury. And 
Allah is Self-sufficient, Forbearing. 

264 O you who believe, do not make your charity worthless 
by reproach and injury, like him who spends his wealth to be seen 
by people and does not believe in Allah and the Last Day. c So his 
parable is as the parable of a smooth rock with earth upon it, then 
heavy rain falls upon it, so it leaves it bare! They are not able to 
gain anything of what they earn. And Allah does not guide the 
disbelieving people. 265 And the parable of those who spend their 



how You give life to the dead." He believed in the Divine promise, but how 
would it be fulfilled? The answer to Abraham's how as given in the Quran is a 
perfectly intelligible parable. If he should take four birds and tame them, they 
would obey his call and fly to him even from distant mountains. The words "place 
a part (juz ') of them" can only mean one each of the four birds. The story of 
cutting the birds into pieces, in connection with this verse, is not traceable to any 
reliable authority, nor do these words occur here. {Editor 's Note: To revive a dead 
people with spiritual truth, from which they are running away like birds, they 
have to be tamed as one tames birds so that instead of being repelled away from 
the truth they are attracted towards it even from a great distance.) 

a (261) The expenditure of money must be accompanied with hard labour, as 
a seed cast on the ground unaccompanied by any labour would not grow. 

b (262) Gifts, whether given in the cause of national or individual suffering, 
must not be accompanied by any interested motives; hence the donor is forbidden 
even to mention them afterwards. 

c (264-1) This conveys a very strong disapproval of giving charity to be seen 
by people, making it utterly hateful in the sight of true believers. 

d (264-2) The concluding words of the parable show that the efforts of the 
disbelievers to deal a death-blow to Islam are meant here. They were spending 
their money to retard the advancement of Islam, but their efforts would be 
fruitless. 



2 : 266 • SPENDING MONEY IN THE CAUSE OF TRUTH 65 

wealth to seek Allah's pleasure and for the strengthening of their 
souls is as the parable of a garden on elevated ground, upon which 
heavy rain falls, so it brings forth its fruit twofold; but if heavy 
rain does not fall on it, light rain (is sufficient)." And Allah is Seer 
of what you do. 266 Does one of you like to have a garden of palms 
and vines with streams flowing in it — he has in it all kinds of 
fruits — and old age has overtaken him and he has weak 
offspring, when a whirlwind with fire in it strikes it so it becomes 
blasted. Thus Allah makes the messages clear to you that you may 
reflect. 

Section 37: Spending in the Cause of Truth 

267 O you who believe, spend (on good works) out of the 
good things that you earn and out of what We bring forth for you 
from the earth, and do not aim at the bad to spend from it, while 
you would not take it yourselves unless you turned a blind eye to it.* 
And know that Allah is Self-sufficient, Praiseworthy. 268 The devil 
threatens you with poverty and commands you to be miserly, and 
Allah promises you forgiveness from Himself and abundance. 
And Allah is Ample-giving, Knowing; 269 He grants wisdom to 
whom He pleases. And whoever is granted wisdom, he indeed is 
given a great good. And none are mindful but those who have 
understanding. 270 And whatever you spend in charity or (whatever) 
vow you vow, Allah surely knows it. And the wrongdoers shall 
have no helpers. 

271 If you manifest charity, how excellent it is! And if you 
hide it and give it to the poor, it is good for you. c And it will do 



a (265) This is the parable of the believers who will reap the fruits of the 
sacrifices they make. 

b (267) Muslims are here enjoined to support the cause of Truth by spending 
good things, things which they love, and not to even think of giving bad things, 
things which they themselves would not accept from others. Elsewhere it is said: 
"You cannot attain to righteousness unless you spend out of what you love" 
(3:92). 

c (271) The manifesting of charity or giving charity openly is quite different 
from giving "to be seen by people", for which see v. 264. By the giving of charity 



66 2. THE COW • 2 : 272 

away with some of your evil deeds; and Allah is Aware of what 
you do. 272 Their guidance is not jour duty, but Allah guides whom 
He pleases. And whatever good thing you spend, it is to your good. 
And you do not spend but to seek Allah's pleasure. And whatever 
good thing you spend, it will be paid back to you in full, and you 
will not be wronged." 

273 (Charity is) for the poor who are confined in the way of 
Allah, 4 they cannot go about in the land; the ignorant man thinks 
them to be rich on account of (their) abstaining (from begging). 
Fou can recognize them by their mark — they do not beg of people 
demandingly. c And whatever good thing you spend, surely Allah 
is Knower of it. 

Section 38: Usury prohibited 

274 Those who spend their wealth by night and day, privately 
and publicly, their reward is with their Lord; and they have no 
fear, nor shall they grieve. 275 Those who swallow usury cannot 
arise except as he arises whom the devil prostrates by (his) touch. rf 

openly is meant the giving of subscriptions for the advancement of national or 
public welfare. The rule laid down here enjoins public as well as private acts of 
charity, mentioning public charity first, as that is of greatest importance. 

a (272) Muslims did not fight to bring the disbelievers into the fold of Islam; 
for that, the Prophet is told here in plain words, was not his responsibility. It was 
for the good of their people, for their defence, that the Muslims were required to 
raise subscriptions. Hence what they spent was for Allah's pleasure, because it 
was in the cause of truth. They are assured that for these deeds of sacrifice they 
will be fully rewarded. As regards private charity, Muslim charity was exercised 
not only for the welfare of their own people but also for that of non-Muslims. 
Islam did not allow difference of religion to be a hindrance in giving charity. 

b (273-1) "Confined in the way of Allah" included those who had to fight in 
defence of Islam but had no means of livelihood, those who could not go forth to 
trade because of insecurity, and those who were wounded in the fighting. 

c (273-2) Those who abstain from begging deserve to be assisted by private 
acts of charity. 

d (275-1) Riba means an addition over and above the principal sum that is 
lent and includes usury as well as interest. Just as charity is the broad basis of 
human sympathy, usury annihilates all sympathetic affection and leads to the 



2 : 276 • USURY PROHIBITED 67 

That is because they say, Trading is only like usury. And Allah 
has allowed trading and forbidden usury." To whomsoever then 
the exhortation has come from his Lord, and he refrains, he shall 
have what has already passed. And his affair is in the hands of 
Allah. And whoever returns (to it) — these are the companions of 
the Fire: in it they will abide. 276 AUah will blot out usury, and He 
causes charity to prosper. And Allah does not love any ungrateful 
sinner. 277 Those who believe and do good deeds and keep up 
prayer and give the due charity — their reward is with their Lord; 
and they have no fear, nor shall they grieve. 

278 O you who believe, keep your duty to Allah and relin- 
quish what remains (due) from usury, if you are believers. 
279 But if you do not, then be apprised of war from Allah and His 
Messenger^ and if you repent, then you shall have your capital. 



extreme of miserliness. Islam refused to allow the rich to grow richer by reducing 
the poor to still greater poverty, which is the real aim of usury. Usury causes man 
to be obsessed by love of wealth and selfishness; and this is, in fact, what is meant 
by the devil prostrating a devourer of usury. It may also be mentioned that while 
Islam enjoins acts of sacrifice to carry on the struggle for national existence, it 
prohibits usurious dealings which are the basis of modern warfare. All wars are 
now carried on with the help of loans, interest on which ultimately is a source of 
ruin to both the conquerers and the conquered. A just war, a war in self-defence, 
would always lead a community to acts of sacrifice to which they would be 
impelled in the interest of their own existence. 

a (275-2) In trade the capitalist takes the risk of loss along with the hope of 
profit, but in lending money on usury the whole of the loss is suffered by the one 
who uses his labour, while the capitalist may count upon his profit even in the 
case of loss in the actual concern. Hence trading is quite different from usury. 

b (276) Usury is here condemned, while charitable deeds are commended as 
being the real source of the prosperity of a nation or of humanity in general. It is a 
prophetic reference to the general tendency in the growth of civilization to lessen- 
ing rates of interest, so much so that usurious dealings, in the proper sense of the 
word, are becoming almost extinct, while the tendency for public charity or 
personal sacrifice in the interests of a community, or even humanity in general, is 
gaining ground. 

c (279) Going directly against the commandments of Allah is here described 
as a war with Allah and His Messenger. The money received as bank interest may 
be spent in the cause of Allah and His Messenger or for the propagation of Islam.

Wrong not, and you shall not be wronged. 280 And if (the debtor) is 
in difficulty, let there be postponement till (he is in) ease. And that 
you forgo it as charity is better for you, if only you knew. a 281 And 
guard yourselves against a day in which you will be returned to 
Allah. Then every soul will be paid in full what it has earned, and 
they will not be wronged. 

Section 39: Contracts and Evidence 

282 O you who believe, when you contract a debt for a fixed 
time, write it down. And let a scribe write it down between you 
with fairness; nor should the scribe refuse to write as Allah has 
taught him, so let him write. And let him who owes the debt 
dictate, and he should observe his duty to Allah, his Lord, and not 
diminish anything from it. But if he who owes the debt is unsound 
in understanding or weak, or (if) he is not able to dictate himself, 
let his guardian dictate with fairness. e And call to witness from 
among your men two witnesses; but if there are not two men, then 
one man and two women from among those whom you choose to 

In fact the Divine purpose in the prohibition of interest is fulfilled if interest is 
changed into charity. 

a (280) This indicates the kind of sympathy Islam demands. The poor man is 
not to be prosecuted and thrown into prison, and payment of debt must be post- 
poned till the debtor is able to pay, or, better still, the whole may be remitted as 
charity. 

b (282-1) If Islam enjoins charity and prohibits usury, it also requires that the 
greatest precautions must be taken for safeguarding property rights. The Arabs 
were quite an illiterate people, among whom writing was very rare. Even then they 
were required to put down all their transactions, great or small, in writing, except 
in hand-to-hand dealings. 

c (282-2) A guardian may be appointed for one who is not able to manage 
his own property because he is a minor or his understanding is not sound on 
account of age or any other reason. 

d (282-3) As women did not take much part in business, and might be 
unfamiliar with the transaction, two women are required instead of one man. 
(Editor's Note: It is quite unwarranted to presume from this advice that the evi- 
dence of two women equals the evidence of one man. According to 24:6-9 if a 
husband accuses his wife of adultery which she denies and he is the sole witness, 
her testimony is treated as of equal value to his. In 5:106 and 65:2 it is required to 



2 : 283 • CONTRACTS AND EVIDENCE 69 

be witnesses, so that if one of the two commits error, the one may 
remind the other." And the witnesses must not refuse when they 
are summoned. And do not be averse to writing it whether it is 
small or large along with the time of its falling due. This is more 
equitable in the sight of Allah and makes testimony surer and the 
best way to keep away from doubts. But when it is ready mer- 
chandise which you give and take among yourselves from hand to 
hand, there is no blame on you in not writing it down. And have 
witnesses when you sell to one another. And let no harm be done 
to the scribe or to the witnesses. And if you do (it), then surely it 
is a transgression on your part. And keep your duty to Allah. And 
Allah teaches you. And Allah is Knower of all things. 

283 And if you are on a journey and you cannot find a scribe, 
a security may be taken into possession.^ But if one of you trusts 
another, then he who is trusted should deliver his trust, and let him 
keep his duty to Allah, his Lord. And do not conceal testimony. 
And whoever conceals it, his heart is surely sinful. And Allah is 
Knower of what you do. 

have "two just ones" as witnesses and not specifically men. There are a number of 
reports in Hadith showing that the Holy Prophet Muhammad gave full weight to 
the testimony of a woman.) 

a (282-4) The personal pronoun humd may refer either to the testimony of 
the two witnesses or the two women. Reminding here stands for making up the 
deficiency of the other's memory. The Holy Quran does not say that no case 
should be decided except on the testimony of two witnesses, but requires ordinari- 
ly the calling of two witnesses at the time of the transaction, so that the deficiency 
of one may be rectified by the other. Cases may be decided on circumstantial 
evidence as well, which is sometimes stronger than the evidence of witnesses. The 
Quran itself speaks of Joseph's innocence being established on circumstantial 
evidence (12:26-27). 

b (282-5) The scribe and the witnesses must not be made to suffer loss in 
their own business. In other words, their convenience must be kept in view, and 
they should be paid. 

c (283) This does not mean that a security cannot be taken in any other case. 
Security may be taken when the lender does not trust the debtor. Also, advantage 
can be derived by the lender from the property which has been given into his 
possession as a security for the debt.

Section 40: Muslims shall be made Victorious 

284 To Allah belongs whatever is in the heavens and what- 
ever is in the earth. And whether you manifest what is in your 
minds or hide it, Allah will call you to account according to it." So 
He forgives whom He pleases and punishes whom He pleases. 
And Allah is Powerful over all things. 

285 The Messenger believes in what has been revealed to him 
from his Lord, and (so do) the believers. They all believe in Allah 
and His angels and His Books and His messengers. We make no 
distinction between any of His messengers. And they say: We hear 
and obey; our Lord, Your forgiveness (do we crave), and to You is 
the eventual course. 

286 Allah does not impose on any soul a duty beyond its 
ability. To its benefit is what (good) it earns, and to its detriment 
is what (evil) it works. Our Lord, do not punish us if we forget or 
make a mistake. Our Lord, do not lay on us a burden as You did 
lay on those before us. Our Lord, do not impose on us (afflictions) 
which we have not the strength to bear. And pardon us! And grant 
us protection! And have mercy on us! You are our Patron, so grant 
us victory over the disbelieving peopled 



a (284) This verse does not signify "Allah will call you to account for it" but 
that He "will call you to account according to it"; so that he who hides (i.e. keeps 
under control) his evil inclinations and he who manifests (i.e. gives vent to them) 
shall not be dealt with in the same manner, but according to their deserts. Almost 
the same statement is contained in 3:29, where it is said: "Say: Whether you hide 
what is in your hearts or manifest it, Allah knows it". Evil thoughts are not 
unpunishable, but evil inclinations which a man keeps suppressed, and which 
therefore gradually disappear, cannot be included in the category of evil thoughts; 
it is these that are meant here. 

b (285) The breadth of the Muslim faith, which has been dealt with on 
several occasions in this chapter, is again mentioned in reference to the triumph of 
the Muslims; for even if the Muslims were triumphant, their religion could not 
triumph over other religions unless established on very broad principles which 
should commend themselves to all. The triumph of the Muslim religion would be 
due to the excellence and breadth of its principles. Hence, even in these days of 
Muslim political decadence, Islam is making spiritual conquests. 

c (286) See next page. 



2:284' MUSLIMS SHALL BE MADE VICTORIOUS 71 

c (286) As a preliminary to the prayer for victory over the disbelieving people, 
there is one set of three petitions in the first part of the verse and another set of 
three petitions in the second part. The first three petitions made to God are do not 
punish us, do not lay on us the burden of sins, do not impose on us afflictions 
which we have not the strength to bear. Corresponding to these three petitions 
respectively are the three petitions in the second part, pardon us, grant us 
protection, have mercy on us. Thus corresponding to the desire to be saved from 
punishment is the petition that God may pardon His servant whatever faults he 
has committed; corresponding to the desire that one may not be burdened with 
sins is the petition that one may be granted protection from the commission of 
sins; and corresponding to the desire to be saved from afflictions which one has 
not the strength to bear is the petition for the mercy of God. 

It is noteworthy that if Muslims are taught to pray for victory over dis- 
believers, as here, they are at the same time taught to be humble and forgiving. 



Chapter 3 
ai 'immn The Family of Amran 

The name of this chapter is taken from the mention of 'Imran in v. 33, who is 
Amran of the Bible, the father of Moses and Aaron. It deals with the depar- 
ture of prophethood from the Mosaic dispensation. It opens with a rule of 
interpretation for Divine books, which is that any allegorical statement must 
be interpreted so as not to contradict the clear principles laid down by Divine 
revelation. This is a preliminary to a discussion of Christian doctrines, which 
are based on wrong interpretations of certain allegorical statements. The 
chapter then deals with: the last Divine elect of the Israelites, including Jesus, 
after whom the spiritual kingdom was granted to the Muslims, religious 
controversy with the Jews and Christians, and their opposition to Islam, testi- 
mony to the truth of Islam in previous scriptures, the need for Muslim unity, 
the need for Muslims to show perseverance in suffering as in the battle of 
Uhud, and how they will triumph in the end after their struggles. Almost the 
entire chapter was revealed in 3 A.H. 



Section 1 : Rule of Interpretation 

In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful. 

1 I, Allah, am the Best Knower," 2 Allah, (there is) no god but 
He, the Ever-living, the Self-subsisting, by Whom all subsist. 
3 He has revealed to you the Book with truth/ verifying what is 
(already) before it, and He revealed the Torah and the Gospel 



a (1) For explanation, see 2:1 footnote. 

b (2) As this chapter controverts Christian doctrines, it fittingly opens with 
two attributes of the Divine Being, the Ever-living and the Self-subsisting, which 
refute the doctrine of the divinity of Jesus Christ. The statement that there is no 
god but He contains an ideal expression of the religion of Islam in four words. 

c (3-1) "With truth" signifies that the Quran was revealed suitably to the 
requirements of wisdom and justice, and to the exigencies of the case; in other 
words, it was revealed at a time when revelation was sorely needed by humanity. 

d (3-2) Taurat is the name given to the books of Moses, or the Pentateuch, 
and hence its correct rendering is the Hebrew word Torah. The Taurat does not 
signify the Old Testament, because the latter is the name of the whole collection 



72 



3:4« RULE OF INTERPRETATION 73 

4 before, a guidance for the people," and He sent the Criterion. 
Those who disbelieve in the messages of Allah — for them is a 
severe punishment. And Allah is Mighty, the Lord of retribution/ 
5 Surely nothing in the earth or in the heaven is hidden from Allah. 
6 He it is Who shapes you in the wombs as He pleases. There is no 
god but He, the Mighty, the Wise. 

7 He it is Who has revealed the Book to you; some of its verses 
are decisive — they are the basis of the Book — and others are 
allegorical. Then those in whose hearts is perversity follow the 
part of it which is allegorical, seeking to mislead, and seeking to give 
it (their own) interpretation. 6 And none knows its interpretation 

of the books of the Israelite prophets. The word Injil (Gospel) does not signify the 
New Testament but the revelation granted to Jesus. 

a (4-1) The Torah and the Gospel were undoubtedly a guidance before the 
Quran; but even as they now exist, they afford guidance in many respects with a 
mixture of error, and contain numerous prophecies fulfilled in the advent of 
Prophet Muhammad. 

b (4-2) See 2:53 and 2:185 footnote 3. The Quran is here mentioned by the 
name Furqdn or that which distinguishes between truth and falsehood, and pro- 
vides a criterion, because it was sent to separate the truth in previous revelation 
from the falsehood which had found its way into it. As the Furqdn, or the 
criterion of truth, in the case of the Holy Prophet was also provided by the battle 
of Badr, this event is referred to in v. 13 as a prelude to the actual controversy. 

c (4-3) The word used here for retribution conveys the idea of avenging but 
not of revenge. 

d (7-1) The Quran establishes certain principles in clear words which are to 
be taken as the basis, while there are statements made in allegorical words or sus- 
ceptible to different meanings, the interpretation of which must be in consonance 
with the other parts and the spirit of the Book. When a certain principle is laid 
down in unmistakable words, any statement carrying a doubtful significance, or 
one which is apparently opposed to that principle, must be interpreted subject to 
the principle enunciated. The subject is appropriately dealt with here as a prelude 
to a controversy with the Christians, who attribute divinity to Jesus on the basis of 
certain ambiguous words or allegorical statements, without heeding the funda- 
mental principles established by the earlier prophets. 

e (7-2) These are people who do not care to seek the real interpretation which 
can only be found by referring to the principles laid down elsewhere but give an 
interpretation to an ambiguous verse alone, without considering it in conjunction 
with other similar verses or the principles laid down elsewhere. 



74 3. THE FAMILY OF AMRAN • 3 : 8 

except Allah, and those firmly rooted in knowledge. They say: We 
believe in it, it is all from our Lord." And none are mindful except 
those who have understanding. 8 Our Lord, do not make our hearts 
to deviate after You have guided us and grant us mercy from 
Yourself; surely You are the most liberal Giver. 9 Our Lord, surely 
You are the Gatherer of people on a day about which there is no 
doubt. Surely Allah will not fail in (His) promise. 

Section 2: Unity of God as Basis of all Religions 

10 Those who disbelieve, neither their wealth nor their child- 
ren will avail them at all against Allah. And they will be fuel for 
fire — n as was the case of the people of Pharaoh, and those 
before them! They rejected Our messages, so Allah destroyed 
them on account of their sins. And Allah is Severe in retribution. 
12 Say to those who disbelieve: You will be defeated, and driven 
together to hell; and evil is the resting-place. 13 Indeed there was 
a sign for you in the two armies (which) met together in encounter 
— one party fighting in the way of Allah and the other dis- 
believing, whom they saw twice as many as themselves with the 
sight of the eye. c And Allah strengthens with His aid whom He 
pleases. There is surely a lesson in this for those who have eyes. 



a (7-3) The words it is all from our Lord signify that there is no disagreement 
between the various portions of the Holy Book. Hence the rule of interpretation 
which they follow is that they refer passages which are susceptible to various inter- 
pretations to those whose meaning is obvious or to similar passages, and subject 
particular statements to general principles. 

b (12) This is one of the passages in which the punishment of this life, which 
is defeat, is spoken of in the same breath with the punishment of the Hereafter, 
which is hell. 

c (13) The reference here is to the battle of Badr. The actual strength of the 
two parties was: Quraish about 1000, Muslims 313. The Muslims saw the 
disbelievers to be twice as many as themselves, and therefore they appeared fewer 
in their eyes as compared with their actual numbers. The battle of Badr is here 
stated to be a sign of the truth of the Holy Prophet, not only because of the pro- 
phecies of victory contained in the Quran, but also because of the clear prophecy 
in the Bible in the book of Isaiah, 21:13-17. It speaks of future events in the land 
of Arabia, which clearly came to pass in the emigration of the Muslims to 
Madinah and the defeat, one year later, of the army of the Quraish. 



3:14' UNITY OF GOD AS BASIS OF ALL RELIGIONS 75 

14 The love of desires is made attractive to people — of women 
and sons and hoarded treasures of gold and silver and well-bred 
horses and cattle and crop produce. This is the provision of the life 
of this world. And Allah — with Him is the good goal (of life). 
15 Say: Shall I tell you of what is better than these? For those who 
guard against evil are Gardens with their Lord, in which rivers 
flow, to abide in them, and pure companions and Allah's goodly 
pleasure." And Allah is Seer of the servants. 16 Those who say: Our 
Lord, we believe, so forgive our sins and save us from the punish- 
ment of the fire. 17 The patient and the truthful and the obedient 
and those who spend (on good works) and those who ask Divine 
protection in the morning times. 

18 Allah bears witness that there is no god but He, and (so do) 
the angels and those possessed of knowledge, maintaining justice. e 
There is no god but He, the Mighty, the Wise. 19 Surely the (true) 
religion with Allah is Islam. And those who were given the Book 



a (15) For the companions in paradise see 2:25 footnote 3. Among the 
blessings of paradise is Allah's goodly pleasure, which is elsewhere said to be the 
greatest of all the blessings of paradise (9:72). The addition of this word here 
shows that the blessings of paradise are spiritual. 

b (17) Seeking of Divine protection (istighfar) is really a prayer to attain to 
sinlessness. The righteous servants of God are here spoken of as possessing the 
great qualifications of steadfastness, truthfulness, obedience to God, spending in 
Allah's way, and finally as resorting to istighfar or Divine protection, which shows 
that it is one of the highest stages to which the spiritual pilgrim aspires. 

c (18) Allah bears witness to His Unity through nature, which is His handi- 
work, and also by His word made known through revelation. The angels bear 
witness by their working within man, whose nature bears testimony to Divine 
Unity. Those who have a true knowledge of the holy scriptures of any religion 
also bear testimony to the great truth of the Unity of Allah. The Unity of Allah is, 
in fact, the common principle which is recognized by all religions. 

The words maintaining justice most likely qualify those possessed of know- 
ledge, the meaning being that every possessor of knowledge, to whatever religion 
he may belong, bears witness to the grand truth of Divine Unity if he maintains 
justice in bearing witness. 

d (19) The meaning is that the principle of submission to God, thereby enter- 
ing into peace, has always been the true religion. According to the Holy Quran, 
Islam was the religion of all the prophets. The Israelite prophets who followed 



76 3. THE FAMILY OF AMRAN • 3 : 20 

differed only after knowledge had come to them, out of envy 
among themselves. And whoever disbelieves in the messages of 
Allah — Allah indeed is Quick at reckoning. 20 But if they dispute 
with you say: I submit myself entirely to Allah and (so does) he 
who follows me. And say to those who have been given the Book 
and the Unlearned (people):" Do you submit yourselves? If they 
submit, then indeed they follow the right way; and if they turn 
back, jour duty is only to deliver the message. And Allah is Seer 
of the servants. 

Section 3: Kingdom granted to another People 

21 Those who disbelieve in the messages of Allah and would kill 
the prophets unjustly and kill those among people who command 
(the doing of) justice, announce to them a painful punishment. 
22 Those are they whose deeds will be fruitless in this world and 
the Hereafter, and they will have no helpers. 23 Have you not seen 
those who are given a portion of the Book? They are invited to 
the Book of Allah that it may decide between them, then some of 
them turn back and they withdraw/ 24 This is because they say: 
The Fire shall not touch us but for a few days; and what they forge 
deceives them regarding their religion. 25 Then how will it be when 
We gather them together on a day about which there is no doubt. 
And every soul shall be fully paid what it has earned, and they 
shall not be wronged? 

26 Say: O Allah, Owner of the Kingdom, You give the king- 
dom to whom You please, and take away the kingdom from whom 

Moses are spoken of as the prophets who submitted themselves (to Allah) (5:44). 
It is also the natural religion of man, as in 30:30 it is described as being "the 
nature made by Allah in which He has created mankind". 

a (20) By the Unlearned people are meant the Arabs. 

b (23-1) The Jews are spoken of as being given only a portion of the Book, 
because much of it had already been lost. Moreover, the Torah was not a complete 
law. 

c (23-2) The reference here is to the broad principles of religion regarding 
which the Jews and the Christians differed. The Book of Allah is the Holy Quran 
which gave a decision in the differences between them. 



3 : 27 • KINGDOM GRANTED TO ANOTHER PEOPLE 77 

You please, and You exalt whom You please and degrade whom 
You please. In Your hand is the good. Surely You are Powerful 
over all things. 27 You make the night to pass into the day and You 
make the day to pass into the night; and You bring forth the living 
from the dead and You bring forth the dead from the living; and 
You give sustenance to whom You please without measure." 

28 The believers should not take the disbelievers as allies 
rather than believers. And whoever does this has no connection 
with Allah — except that you guard yourselves against them, c 
guarding carefully. And Allah cautions you against His retribu- 
tion. And to Allah is the eventual coming. 29 Say: Whether you 
hide what is in your hearts or manifest it, Allah knows it. And He 
knows whatever is in the heavens and whatever is in the earth. 
And Allah is Powerful over all things. 30 On the day when every 
soul will find present whatever good it has done, and whatever 
evil it has done, it will wish that between it and that (evil) there 
were a long distance. And Allah cautions you against His retribu- 
tion. And Allah is Compassionate to the servants. 



a (27) Verses 26-27 refer to the fact that kingdom and honour shall be given 
now to another nation, whose night shall be made to pass into a day of triumph. 
The Jews had already been warned by Jesus that "the kingdom of God will be 
taken from you and given to a nation bearing the fruits of it" (Matthew, 21:43). A 
living nation of Muslims was brought forth from among the dead Arabs, and the 
living nation of Israelites was represented now by a people who were spiritually 
dead. 

b (28-1) The Muslims, being in a state of war with the disbelievers, were 
forbidden to look to their enemies to guard their interests or for help of any kind. 
The clear statement made in 60:8-9 settles the point beyond all doubt: "Allah 
does not forbid you, with regard to those who do not fight you for religion, nor 
drive you forth from your homes, that you show them kindness and deal with 
them justly. . . . Allah forbids you only with regard to those who fight you for 
religion, and drive you forth from your homes and help (others) in your expulsion, 
that you make friends of them". 

c (28-2) The meaning is: Do not look to them for guarding your interests, 
rather guard yourselves against them.

Section 4: Last Members of a Chosen Race 

31 Say: If you love Allah, follow me: Allah will love you, a 
and grant you protection from your sins. And Allah is Forgiving, 
Merciful. 32 Say: Obey Allah and the Messenger; but if they turn 
back, Allah surely does not love the disbelievers. 

33 Truly Allah chose Adam and Noah and the descendants of 
Abraham and the descendants of Amran above the nations,* 
34 offspring, one of the other. And Allah is Hearing, Knowing. 
35 When a woman of Amran c said: My Lord, I vow to You what is 
in my womb, to be devoted (to Your service), so accept (it) from 
me; surely You, only You, are the Hearing, the Knowing. 36 So when 
she gave birth to it, she said: My Lord, I have given birth to a 
female — and Allah knew best what she had given birth to — and 
the male is not like the female, and I have named it Mary, and I 
commend her and her offspring into Your protection from the 
accursed devil. 6 



a (31) The love of Allah is the great goal of life to which Islam leads. 

b (33) Here begins the story of Jesus Christ, the central figure of the Chris- 
tian religion, and as a preliminary we are told that if Jesus was chosen by God so 
were his great ancestors, Adam and Noah. The descendants of Abraham and 
Amran are then spoken of as having been chosen above the nations. For the 
choice of the descendants of Abraham, see 2:124 footnote. They are divided into 
two branches, the Israelites and the Ishmaelites. The former are here spoken of as 
the descendants of 'Imran, who is the same as Amran of the Bible. The descen- 
dants of Amran are Moses and Aaron. Moses became the founder of the Israelite 
law and Aaron the head of the Israelite priesthood. The last of this race were John 
and Jesus. Their parents, Zacharias and Mary, are first spoken of here. 

c (35) Imra 'at means a woman and also a wife. I take imra 'at 'Imran as 
meaning a woman of the family of Amran rather than wife of Amran because the 
name of a great ancestor is frequently used to indicate the nation which has 
sprung from him. According to tradition, however, 'Imran was the name of 
Mary's father, and therefore the words imra'at 'Imran may mean the wife of 
Amran. 

d (36-1) She had vowed the child to be devoted to the service of the Temple, 
but a female could not do the priestly work. 

e (36-2) Mary's mother while praying for Mary prays also for her offspring, 
because, while dedicating her daughter to the Temple, she entertained the hope 
that Mary would eventually become a wife and mother. 



3:37* BIRTH OF JESUS AND HIS MINISTRY 79 

37 So her Lord accepted her with a goodly acceptance and 
made her grow up a goodly growing, and gave her into the charge 
of Zacharias. Whenever Zacharias entered the sanctuary to (see) 
her, he found food with her. He said: Mary, from where does this 
come to you? She said: It is from Allah. Surely Allah gives to 
whom He pleases without measure." 38 There did Zacharias pray 
to his Lord. He said: My Lord, grant me from Yourself goodly 
offspring; surely You are the Hearer of prayer. 39 So the angels 
called to him as he stood praying in the sanctuary: Allah gives you 
the good news of John, verifying a word from Allah, c and 
honourable and chaste and a prophet from among the good ones. 
40 He said: My Lord, how can I have a son when old age has 
already come upon me, and my wife is barren? He said: Even thus 
does Allah do what He pleases. 41 He said: My Lord, appoint a sign 
for me. Said He: Four sign is that you do not speak to people for 
three days except by signs. And remember your Lord much and 
glorify (Him) in the evening and early morning. 

Section 5: Birth of Jesus and his Ministry 

42 And when the angels said: O Mary, surely Allah has chosen 
you and purified you and chosen you above the women of the world. 
43 Mary, be obedient to your Lord and humble yourself and bow 
down with those who bow. 44 This is among the tidings of things 



a (37) Mary's reply, that she got sustenance/rom Allah, is the reply of every 
devout person who believes that Allah is the sustainer of all, and that therefore all 
provision or sustenance comes from Him. Mary being attached to the Temple, the 
worshippers would naturally bring gifts to her, and as it was through Divine grace 
that she received these gifts she said that it was Allah Who gave her these things. 

b (39-1) The Arabic word for John is Yahya, this name indicating that he 
would not die in sin like his other relations. 

c (39-2) The promise given to Zacharias was a word from Allah, and John 
was the verifier of that word, because his birth brought about the fulfilment of the 
prophecy. A word from Allah, therefore, stands for a Divine prophecy; see also 
6:34 and 10:64. 

rf(43) After speaking of Mary's birth and her growing up, the Quran now 
speaks of her election just as the righteous before her were elected. Evidently this 
refers to a time when she had grown up to the age of puberty and left the temple. 



80 3. THE FAMILY OF AMRAN • 3 : 45 

unseen which We reveal to you. And you were not with them 
when they cast their pens (to decide) which of them should have 
Mary in his charge, and you were not with them when they con- 
tended with one another." 

45 When the angels said: O Mary, surely Allah gives you 
good news with a word from Him (of one) whose name is the 
Messiah, Jesus, son of Mary, c worthy of regard in this world and 
the Hereafter, and one of those who are drawn near (to Allah), 
46 and he will speak to the people when in the cradle and when of 
old age, and (he will be) one of the good ones. 47 She said: My 
Lord, how can I have a son and man has not yet touched me? He 
said: Even so; Allah creates what He pleases. When He decrees a 
matter, He only says to it, Be, and it is. e 



a (44) This verse cannot refer back to Mary's history as a child in the temple, 
as some think. The Quran has described her history in the natural order: her con- 
ception (v. 35), birth (v. 36), being dedicated to and residing in the temple (v. 37), 
and her election at the age of discretion (v. 42 and 43). Therefore this particular 
incident refers to her espousal. The casting of lots and the contention as to who 
should have her in his charge means her charge as a wife. 

b (45-1) The good news was given by means of a prophetic word from God. 

c (45-2) The Quran makes no mention at all of Mary's husband, but nor does 
it at all mention Moses' father when relating the circumstances of Moses' birth. 
The mere fact, therefore, that there is no mention of Jesus' father is not sufficient 
to show that Jesus had no father. Moreover, of his two parents Joseph and Mary, 
Mary was undoubtedly much more well-known than Joseph. 

d (46) Speaking "when in the cradle and when of old age" cannot be consi- 
dered as miracles, as the latter is undoubtedly not. The good news conveyed con- 
sists in the fact that the child announced will be a healthy child and shall not die 
in childhood. It would thus appear that, according to the Holy Quran, Jesus did 
not die at thirty-three years of age, but lived to a sufficiently old age. 

e (47) She is told in reply to her question that the child will be born because 
God would bring about the circumstances which result in the birth of a child. The 
words do not show that she would conceive out of the ordinary course of nature, 
for there is no doubt that Mary had other children, which no one supposes to have 
been conceived out of the ordinary course of nature. Nor do the words that follow 
prove anything beyond the simple fact that Mary must give birth to a son in accor- 
dance with the prophecy. The whole of creation is brought about, we are told 
again and again, by the Divine word "Be" (see 2:117), yet no one supposes that 
creation is not brought about according to the laws of nature. 



3:48* BIRTH OF JESUS AND HIS MINISTRY 8 1 

48 And He will teach him the Book and the Wisdom and the 
Torah and the Gospel, 49 and (make him) a messenger to the Child- 
ren of Israel (saying): I have come to you with a sign from your 
Lord, that I determine for you out of dust the form of a bird, then I 
breathe into it and it becomes a bird with Allah's permission, and 
I heal the blind and the leprous, and bring the dead to life e with 
Allah's permission; and I inform you of what you should eat and 
what you should store in your houses. Surely there is a sign in 
this for you, if you are believers. 50 And (I have come) verifying 
what is (already) before me of the Torah, and I allow you part of 
what was forbidden to you; 6 and I have come to you with a sign 
from your Lord, so keep your duty to Allah and obey me. 51 Surely 
Allah is my Lord and your Lord, so serve Him. This is the right 
path. 



a (49-1) As Jesus spoke in parables, this passage must be taken allegorically. 
What is meant is that Jesus, by breathing a spirit into mortals, will make them rise 
above those who are bent low upon the earth, and the apostles of Jesus, who were 
all men of humble origin (which is referred to in the word dust in the parable), left 
everything for the master's sake and went into the world by his command to 
preach the truth. Here was mere dust having the form of a bird, which the messen- 
ger of God converted into high-soaring birds by breathing truth into them. 

b (49-2) The Quran gives an explanation of the healing of the sick when, 
speaking of itself, it says that it is "a healing for what is in the hearts" (10:57), i.e. 
for spiritual diseases. A prophet's healing is spiritual, not healing of physical dis- 
eases. The Quran speaks of the blind and the deaf frequently, but it never means 
those who do not possess the senses of seeing and hearing. 

c (49-3) The Quran says plainly that those who die are not sent back to this 
world; see 39:42 and 23:100. But the use of the word mauta, i.e. the dead, and of 
their being raised to life, is frequent in the Quran in a spiritual sense: "Is he who 
was dead, then We raised him to life . . . like him whose likeness is that of one in 
darkness" (6:122). And again: "O you who believe, respond to Allah and His 
Messenger, when He calls you to that which gives you life" (8:24). The prophets 
are raised only for quickening to life those who are spiritually dead, and it is to 
this quickening through Jesus that the Quran refers here. 

d (49-4) Jesus laid special stress on not having any care "for the morrow", 
and advised a rich man when he came to him to sell all he had. He would have 
them lay up treasures in heaven. The verse refers to this aspect of his teaching. 

e (50) The law of Moses was upheld by the Israelite prophets, but amended 
from time to time. These changes are particularly marked out in Jesus' teaching. 



82 3. THE FAMILY OF AMRAN • 3 : 52 

52 But when Jesus perceived disbelief on their part, he said: 
Who will be my helpers in Allah's way? The disciples said: We 
are Allah's helpers, we believe in Allah, and (ask you to) bear 
witness that we are submitting ones. 53 0ur Lord, we believe in 
what You have revealed and we follow the messenger, so write us 
down with those who bear witness. 54 And (the Jews) planned and 
Allah (also) planned. And Allah is the Best of planners." 

Section 6: Jesus cleared of False Charges 

55 When Allah said: O Jesus, I will cause you to die* and 
exalt you in My presence c and clear you of those who disbelieve 
and make those who follow you above those who disbelieve to the 
day of Resurrection. 6 Then to Me is your return, so I shall decide 
between you in that in which you differ.' 56 Then as to those who 
disbelieve, I shall punish them with severe punishment in this world 



a (54) The word makr used here is the equivalent of the word plan, the good 
or evil nature of the plan being dependent on the doer's intention. The Jews plan- 
ned to put Jesus to death by crucifixion, and Allah made a plan to frustrate their 
plans; and Allah's plan was successful, i.e. he was saved from death on the cross, 
for which see 3:55 and 4: 157. 

b (55-1) Ibn Abbas says that the words used here, mutawafji-ka, mean 
mumltu-ka, i.e. I will cause you to die (see Bukhari, 65.5:12). These words are 
used to show that the Jewish plans to cause Jesus' death on the cross would be 
frustrated and that he would afterwards die a natural death; see 4:157. 

c (55-2) The word raf signifies raising or elevating, and also exalting or 
making honourable. When the raf of a human being to Allah is spoken of in the 
religious literature of Islam, it is always in the sense of exaltation. The exaltation 
of Jesus is mentioned here as a reply to the Jews, whose object was to make him 
die an accursed and ignominious death on the cross. 

rf(55-3) This signifies clearing Jesus of the false charges relating to the 
alleged illegitimacy of his birth, and so on, charges of which Jesus was cleared by 
the Quran. 

e (55-4) This is the fourth promise made to Jesus in this verse, that those 
who follow Jesus shall be made dominant over his rejectors till the day of Judg- 
ment. Its truth is witnessed to this day in the dominance of the Christians over the 
Jews. 

/(55-5) Differences of belief are dealt with in the life after death, while the 
worst of transgressions in deeds are punished even in this life. 



3:57* JESUS CLEARED OF FALSE CHARGES 83 

and the Hereafter, and they will have no helpers. 57 And as to those 
who believe and do good deeds, He will pay them fully their 
rewards. And Allah does not love the unjust. 

58 This We recite to you of the messages and the Reminder 
full of wisdom. 59 The likeness of Jesus with Allah is truly as the 
likeness of Adam. He created him from dust, then said to him, Be, 
and he was." 60 (This is) the truth from your Lord, so do not be one 
of the disputers. ^Whoever then disputes with you in this matter 
after the knowledge that has come to you, say: Come! Let us call 
our sons and your sons and our women and your women and our 
people and your people, then let us be earnest in prayer, and invoke 
the curse of Allah on the liars. 62 Surely this is the true account, 
and there is no god but Allah. And Allah, He surely is the Mighty, 
the Wise. 63 But if they turn away, then surely Allah knows the 
mischief-makers . 

Section 7: Controversy with Jews and Christians 

64 Say: O People of the Book, come to an equitable word 
between us and you, that we shall serve none but Allah and that 
we shall not set up any partner with Him, and that some of us shall 



a (59) Adam stands for man generally, because all human beings are created 
from dust (see 18:37, 22:5 and 30:20). All that is meant is that Jesus is no more 
than a mortal, and that it is an error to take him for God. If Adam is taken as a 
proper name, the meaning would be that just as Adam was created from dust and 
then chosen by Allah, so was Jesus created from dust, and his election was similar 
to the election of Adam, the command "Be" referring to the election of a right- 
eous servant of Allah. In either case there is no reference to Jesus being brought 
into existence without the agency of a male parent. 

b (61) The persons addressed in particular in this verse are the members of 
the Christian deputation from Najran that came in 10 A.H. to see the Prophet 
Muhammad. The deputation was lodged by the Holy Prophet in his mosque. Thus 
did he set an unparalleled example of freedom of religious belief and practice. 
After the Holy Prophet gave them arguments showing that Jesus was not God, and 
finding them still insisting on their false belief, they were invited as a last resort to 
pray earnestly that the curse of Allah might overtake the party that insisted on 
falsehood. After some deliberation they decided against it and told the Prophet 
that they had decided not to pray against him as suggested. Thereupon they were 
given a pledge by which they were free to practise their religion. 



84 3. THE FAMILY OF AMRAN • 3 : 65 

not take others for lords besides Allah. But if they turn away, then 
say: Bear witness, we are Muslims." 65 People of the Book, why 
do you dispute about Abraham, when the Torah and the Gospel 
were not revealed till after him? Do you not understand? 66 Look! 
You are they who disputed about that of which you had know- 
ledge; why then do you dispute about that of which you have no 
knowledge? And Allah knows while you do not know.* 67 Abraham 
was not a Jew nor a Christian, but he was (an) upright (man), a 
Muslim; and he was not of those who set up partners (with Allah). 
68 The nearest of people to Abraham are surely those who follow him 
and this Prophet and those who believe. And Allah is the Friend of 
the believers. 

69 Some of the People of the Book desire that they should 
lead you astray; and they lead astray only themselves, but they do 
not perceive. 70 O People of the Book, why do you disbelieve in 
the messages of Allah while you witness (their truth)? 71 People 
of the Book, why do you mix the truth with falsehood, and hide 
the truth while you know? 

Section 8: Machinations to discredit Islam 

72 And a group of the People of the Book say: Affirm belief 
in what has been revealed to those who believe, in the first part of 



a (64) In this verse the Jews and the Christians are called upon to accept the 
broad principles of the faith of Abraham, which were also the basic principles of 
the faith of Islam. The words some of us shall not take others for lords is to the 
practice prevailing then both among Jews and Christians, and at present among 
Muslims too, to treat religious leaders as if invested with Divine powers. The basic 
doctrines of Islam are the greatest common measure of the truth contained in 
different religions of the world. The doctrine of Unity as taught by Islam affords 
an illustration. All higher religions start on the basis of Divine Unity but then each 
religious system has its peculiarities unknown to all others. Islam alone is free 
from all these additions to the basic doctrine, and it preaches Unity in its simplest 
form. There are no idols, no gods, no incarnations of the Divine Being, no sons of 
God, and finally no priests or clerics to be followed blindly. 

b (66) The Jews invited people to a belief in the Torah and the Christians to 
a belief in the Gospel, but both these had lost the purity of the faith of Abraham 
which was pure monotheism, unmixed with either Jewish priesthood or Christian 
doctrine of sonship. 



3 : 73 • MACHINATIONS TO DISCREDIT ISLAM 85 

the day, and disbelieve in the latter part of it, perhaps they may 
turn back." 73 And do not believe except in him who follows your 
religion. Say: True guidance — Allah's guidance — is that one 
may be given the like of what you were given; or they would 
prevail on you in argument before your Lord. e Say: Grace is 
surely in Allah's hand. He gives it to whom He pleases. And Allah 
is Ample-giving, Knowing. 74 He specially chooses for His mercy 
whom He pleases. And Allah is the Lord of mighty grace. 

75 And among the People of the Book is he who, if you 
entrust him with a heap of wealth, would pay it back to you; and 
among them is he who, if you entrust him with a dinar, would not 
pay it back to you, unless you kept on demanding it. This is 
because they say there is no blame on us in the matter of the 
unlearned people and they forge a lie against Allah while they 
know. 6 76 No, whoever fulfils his promise and keeps his duty — 
then Allah surely loves the dutiful. 77 Those who take a small price 
for the covenant of Allah and their own oaths — they have no 
portion in the Hereafter, and Allah will not speak to them, nor will 



a (72) This has two different significances. One is that they should affirm 
belief in the earlier part of the revelation, while denying the latter portion, as some 
modern critics do, thus creating doubts as to the sincerity of the Prophet. The 
other is that they should affirm a belief in the truth of Islam in the morning and 
deny it in the evening, creating the impression that the religion of Islam was a 
false religion. The fact that a group of Jews, in Madinah under Muslim rule, could 
conceive this plan is a clear proof that apostates in Islam were not put to death. 

b (73-1) Editor's Note: This is the statement of the Jews continued from v. 
72, that they should not believe in any prophet who did not follow their religion. 

c (73-2) The contention of the Jews not to believe in any prophet who did 
not follow the law of Moses is met with the reply that a revelation must be given 
to another prophet like the revelation that had been given to Moses, for the Divine 
promise to Moses was that God would raise up a prophet like him from among the 
"brethren" of the Israelites (Deuteronomy, 18:18). In this argument the Muslims 
are said to prevail over their opponents. 

d (74) Allah's choosing for His mercy stands here for His choice of a 
prophet. 

e (75) They considered themselves free from all responsibility towards the 
Arabs, despite any agreement they might have made with them. They are, how- 
ever, told that God never allowed dishonesty against any people. 



86 3. THE FAMILY OF AMRAN • 3 : 78 

He look upon them on the day of Resurrection, nor will He purify 
them, and for them is a painful punishment. 

78 And certainly there are some of them who lie about the 
Book that you may consider it to be (a part) of the Book while it is 
not (a part) of the Book; and they say, It is from Allah, while it is 
not from Allah; and they forge a lie against Allah while they 
know. 79 It is not for a mortal that Allah should give him the Book 
and the judgment and the prophethood, then he should tell people: 
Be my servants besides Allah's; but (he would say): Be worship- 
pers of the Lord because you teach the Book and because you 
study (it); 80 nor would he command you to take the angels and the 
prophets for lords." Would he command you to disbelieve after 
you submit? 

Section 9: Covenant of the Prophets 

81 And when Allah made a covenant through the prophets: 
Certainly what I have given you of Book and Wisdom — then a 
Messenger comes to you verifying what is (already) with you, you 
shall believe in him, and you shall aid him. He said: Do you 
affirm and accept My compact in this (matter)? They said: We do 
affirm. He said: Then bear witness, and I (too) am a bearer of wit- 
ness with you. 82 Whoever then turns back after this, these are the 
transgressors. 83 Do they then seek other than Allah's religion? 
And to Him submits whoever is in the heavens and the earth, 



a (80) Thus according to the Quran no prophet — Jesus included — ever 
taught his followers to take him as God. Even the current Gospels do not attribute 
any such teaching to Jesus. The angels are mentioned because the pagan Arabs 
worshipped the angels. 

b (81) The covenant was made through the prophets with their people. Both 
Moses and Jesus specially laid an obligation on their people to accept the prophet 
about whom they prophesied (see, for instance, Deuteronomy 18:18 and John 
16:13). In fact, all the prophets of the world foretold the advent of the Prophet 
Muhammad. The covenant was made through each prophet separately as he 
appeared in the world. And just as all the prophets foretold the advent of the 
Prophet Muhammad and laid an obligation upon their people to accept him, so the 
Prophet Muhammad also taught his followers to believe in all the prophets that 
had appeared among different people in different ages, and this is stated in v. 84. 



3 : 84 • COVENANT OF THE PROPHETS 87 

willingly or unwillingly, and to Him they will be returned. 

84 Say: We believe in Allah and (in) what is revealed to us, 
and (in) what was revealed to Abraham and Ishmael and Isaac and 
Jacob and the tribes, and (in) what was given to Moses and Jesus 
and to the prophets from their Lord; we make no distinction 
between any of them, and to Him we submit. 85 And whoever seeks 
a religion other than Islam, it will not be accepted from him, and in 
the Hereafter he will be one of the losers. 

86 How shall Allah guide a people who disbelieved after their 
believing, and (after) they had borne witness that the Messenger 
was true, and clear arguments had come to them? And Allah does 
not guide the unjust peopled 87 As for these, their reward is that on 
them is the curse of Allah and the angels and of people, all 
together — ""abiding in it. Their punishment shall not be lightened, 
nor shall they be given respite — 89 except those who repent after 
that and amend, for surely Allah is Forgiving, Merciful. 90 Those 
who disbelieve after their believing, then increase in disbelief, 
their repentance is not accepted, and these are they that go astray. 
91 Those who disbelieve and die while they are disbelievers, the earth 
full of gold will not be accepted from anyone of them, though he 
should offer it as ransom. These it is for whom is a painful punish- 
ment, and they shall have no helpers. 



a (83) Compare 13:15, 22:18, etc., where it is said that all those who are in 
the heavens and the earth make submission to Allah. The verse, in fact, shows that 
Islam, or the rule of submission to Divine law, is a law which is seen working 
throughout nature, and this is an argument of the truth of the religion of Islam. 

b (85) The cosmopolitan nature of the religion of Islam having been clearly 
set forth in the previous verse, it is now stated that anyone who refused to accept 
such principles would unfailingly lose in the end. A Muslim accepts the whole 
truth, the truth as revealed to any prophet anywhere in the world, the truth as 
revealed to all mankind. 

c (86) The persons meant are those who believed in the former prophets and 
disbelieved in the Holy Prophet Muhammad. Having clear signs of the Prophet's 
truth with them, and professing a belief in the prophets who had foretold the advent 
of the last of the prophets, they still disbelieved in him. 






88 3. THE FAMILY OF AMRAN • 3 : 92 

Section 10: Ever-living Testimony to Truth of Islam 

92 You cannot attain to righteousness unless you spend (on 
good works) out of what you love." And what you spend, Allah 
surely knows it. 93 A11 food was lawful to the Children of Israel, 
before the Torah was revealed, except what Israel forbade himself. 
Say: Bring the Torah and read it, if you are truthful. 94 So who- 
ever forges a lie against Allah after this, these are the wrongdoers. 

95 Say: Allah speaks the truth; so follow the religion of 
Abraham, the upright one. And he was not one of those who set 
up partners (with Allah). 96 Certainly the first house appointed for 
mankind is the one at Bakkah, c blessed and a guidance for the 
nations. 97 In it are clear signs: (It is) the Place of Abraham; and 
whoever enters it is safe; and pilgrimage to the House is a duty 
which people owe to Allah — whoever can find a way to it. e And 



a (92) The connection with the last verse is clear. No wealth will buy 
redemption for a person if he has wasted his opportunity here, and to make the 
best of that opportunity a person must spend here what he loves most. 

b (93) The Jews objected to the Muslims making use of certain foods which 
the law of Moses did not allow. An answer is given here that such foods were 
lawful for Abraham and his descendants, and Islam agreed in principle with the 
religion of Abraham. By all food is meant all food made lawful for Muslims. 

c (96-1) Bakkah is the same as Makkah (Mecca). The Temple at Jerusalem 
was erected long after Abraham, while the Holy House at Makkah was there even 
before Abraham, and was, in fact, the first House on earth for the worship of the 
Divine Being. 

d (96-2) The word mubarak, rendered as blessed, signifies the continuance 
forever of the blessings which a thing possesses. Thus Makkah is not only the first 
spiritual centre for mankind but also the ultimate spiritual centre for the whole of 
humanity. 

e (97) There are three signs or prophecies here with regard to the future of 
Makkah. The first sign is that it is the Place of Abraham and hence the first 
prophecy is that the doctrine of the Unity of God will be proclaimed to the whole 
world from this centre. The second sign is that Makkah will always be secure, i.e., 
it shall not fall into the hands of an enemy who should destroy it. Thus its security 
is assured both physically and spiritually. The third prophecy is that a pilgrimage 
to the Sacred House shall continue to be made forever, and no power in the world 
shall ever be able to put a stop to it. The most striking fact about these prophecies 
is that they were all announced at a time when the Prophet and his followers had

whoever disbelieves, surely Allah is above need of the worlds. 

98 Say: O People of the Book, why do you disbelieve in the 
messages of Allah? And Allah is a witness of what you do. "Say: 
O People of the Book, why do you hinder those who believe from 
the way of Allah, seeking (to make) it crooked, while you are 
witnesses? And Allah is not heedless of what you do. 100 O you 
who believe, if you obey some of those who have been given the 
Book, they will turn you back as disbelievers after your belief. 
101 And how can you disbelieve while to you are recited the mess- 
ages of Allah, and among you is His Messenger? And whoever 
holds fast to Allah, he indeed is guided to a right path. 

Section 1 1 : Muslims exhorted to remain United 

102 O you who believe, keep your duty to Allah, as it ought 
to be kept, and do not die except as Muslims." 103 And hold fast by 
the covenant of Allah all together and do not be disunited. And 
remember Allah's favour to you when you were enemies, then He 
united your hearts so by His favour you became brethren. And you 
were on the brink of a pit of fire, then He saved you from it. e Thus 
Allah makes clear to you His messages that you may be guided. 
104 And from among you there should be a community who invite 

apparently been driven away forever from the Sacred Place, when that place was 
in the exclusive possession of an enemy who did not allow the Muslims to visit it, 
and when the small Muslim community was in danger of being utterly destroyed 
by that powerful enemy at any moment. 

a (102) The Muslims are exhorted, first to be individually conscious of the 
duty they owe to God (v. 1 02), and then to remain united in carrying the message 
of Islam to the whole world (v. 103). Every Muslim must live a life of true sub- 
mission to God, so that when death comes to him it should find him a Muslim. As 
v. 104 shows, the Muslim's great duty, to which attention is called here, is the 
carrying of the message of Islam to others. 

b (103-1) By the covenant of Allah is meant the Quran, a significance sup- 
ported by sayings of the Holy Prophet. All Muslims, we are here told, should be 
united in holding fast to the Quran and carrying its message to other people. 

c (103-2) Before the advent of the Holy Prophet, the Arabs were in a state of 
continual internecine warfare which threatened to devastate the whole country. He 
brought about the impossible of uniting all these factions. 



90 3. THE FAMILY OF AMRAN • 3 : 105 

to good and enjoin the right and forbid the wrong. And these are 
they who are successful." 105 And do not be like those who became 
divided and disagreed after clear arguments had come to them. 
And for them is a grievous punishment. 

106 On the day when (some) faces will brighten and (some) 
faces will darken. Then as to those whose faces are darkened: Did 
you disbelieve after your belief? So taste the punishment because 
you disbelieved. 107 And as to those whose faces are brightened, 
they shall be in Allah's mercy. In it they shall abide. 108 These are 
the messages of Allah which We recite to you with truth. And Allah 
desires no injustice to (His) creatures. i° 9 And to Allah belongs 
whatever is in the heavens and whatever is in the earth. And to 
Allah are all affairs returned. 

Section 12: Relations of Muslims with Jews 

110 You are the best nation raised up for mankind: you enjoin 
good and forbid evil and you believe in Allah. And if the People 
of the Book had believed, it would have been better for them. 
Some of them are believers but most of them are transgressors. 
m They will not harm you except a slight hurt. And if they fight 
you, they will turn (their) backs to you. Then they will not be 
helped. ^Degradation will be their lot wherever they are found, 



a (104) This verse and 9:122 both direct Muslims to have always among 
them a missionary group, whose only object should be the propagation of Islam 
and rightly directing their own people. This is the most neglected injunction of the 
Quran in our day. Muslims have arrangements for all other things but have no 
arrangements for inviting people to the great truth revealed in the Quran. 

b (106) By faces brightening is meant their being expressive of joy, and by 
their darkening is meant their being expressive of regret. (Editor's Note: Physical 
colour of skin, white or black, is not meant here; compare 16:58: "And when the 
birth of a daughter is announced to one of them, his face becomes dark".) 

c (110) The excellence of the Muslim people lies in their enjoining good and 
forbidding evil and in their great faith in Allah. If they lose these characteristics, 
they lose their excellence as well. Their excellence was no doubt due to the 
excellence of that Great Teacher who thoroughly purified them of the worst vices 
and made perfect the light within them. 



3:113' RELATIONS OF MUSLIMS WITH JEWS 91 

except under a covenant with Allah and a covenant with people," 
and they shall incur the wrath of Allah, and humiliation will be 
made to cling to them. This is because they disbelieved in the 
messages of Allah and killed the prophets unjustly. This is because 
they disobeyed and exceeded the limits. 113 They are not all alike. 
Of the People of the Book some are upright — they recite Allah's 
messages in the night-time and they adore (Him). n4 They believe 
in Allah and the Last Day, and they enjoin good and forbid evil 
and hasten in (doing) good deeds. And those are among the right- 
eous. 115 And whatever good they do, they will not be denied it. 
And Allah knows those who keep their duty. 

116 Those who disbelieve, neither their wealth nor their children 
will avail them at all against Allah. And these are the companions 
of the Fire; in it they abide. 117 The likeness of what they spend in 
the life of this world is as the likeness of wind in which is intense 
cold; it strikes the harvest of a people who are unjust to them- 
selves and destroys it. And Allah did not wrong them but they 
wronged themselves. n8 you who believe, do not take for intimate 
friends others than your own people: they spare no pains to cause 
you loss. c They love whatever distresses you. Vehement hatred has 
already appeared from out of their mouths, and what their hearts 
conceal is greater still. Indeed We have made the messages clear 
to you, if you understand. 119 Look! You are the ones who will love 
them while they do not love you, and you believe in the Book, 



a (112) The Jews had already been subjected to disgrace before the appear- 
ance of the Prophet. But with the advent of Islam they could better their condition 
either by accepting the covenant of Allah, by which is meant the acceptance of 
Islam, or by making a compact of security with such people as could give them 
protection. This remains true to this day. 

b (115) These verses speak of the good among the Jews and the Christians. 
The Quran does not deny that there is good in others, its own eminence lying in 
the fact that it makes man attain the highest degree of perfection in goodness. 
Thus the description of the upright among the followers of the Book concludes 
with the words: whatever good they do, they will not be denied it. 

c (118) As the context shows, these people made war on the Muslims and 
wished to cause them loss. Hence Muslims could not be friendly with them. 

d (119) This verse clearly indicates the difficulties which the Muslims had in

(in) the whole of it. And when they meet you they say, We believe, 
and when they are alone, they bite (their) finger tips in rage against 
you. Say: Die in your rage. Surely Allah is Knower of what is in 
the hearts. 120 If good befalls you, it grieves them, and if an evil 
afflicts you, they rejoice at it. And if you are patient and keep your 
duty, their struggle will not injure you in any way. Surely Allah 
encompasses what they do. 

Section 13: The Battle of Uhud 

121 And when you went forth early in the morning from your 
family, to assign to the believers their positions for the battle. a 
And Allah is Hearing, Knowing. 122 When two parties from among 
you thought of showing cowardice, and Allah was the Guardian of 
them both. And in Allah should the believers trust. 123 And Allah 
certainly helped you at Badr when you were weak. So keep your 
duty to Allah that you may give thanks. 

124 When you said to the believers: Is it not sufficient for you 
that your Lord should help you with three thousand angels sent 
down? * 125 Indeed, if you are steadfast and keep your duty, and 

establishing friendly and loving relations with non-Muslims. The Muslims would 
offer friendship, but the other party was always on the look-out for some oppor- 
tunity to inflict loss on them. 

a (121) Much of the rest of this chapter is devoted to the events of the battle 
of Uhud. In 3 A.H. the Quraish marched against Madinah. The Prophet at first in- 
tended to stay within the town, but afterwards marched into the open field with a 
thousand men, one-third of whom, under the leadership of Abdullah ibn Ubayy, 
the hypocrite leader, left him and returned to Madinah. The enemy were first 
completely routed, but fifty Muslim archers, who were placed in a strong position 
to cut off the retreat of the enemy, made a mistake, and in order to join in the pur- 
suit left their position. The enemy fell back upon the Muslims who were now in 
disorder and had lost their naturally fortified position, and after inflicting some 
loss upon them, left the field secure from the pursuit of the Muslim force. It was 
not a victory for the Quraish, who thought it safe to go back when they found the 
Muslims involved in their own troubles. They could not take a single prisoner of 
war, nor had they the courage to attack Madinah, which they did two years later 
with a very strong force. 

b (124) The promise of the coming of angels is fully explained in the 8th 
chapter in connection with the battle of Badr. As here, it is first stated there that 



3:126' THE BATTLE OF UHUD 93 

they come upon you in a headlong manner, your Lord will assist 
you with five thousand of havoc-making angels." 126 And Allah 
made it only as good news for you, and that your hearts might be 
at ease by it. And help comes only from Allah, the Mighty, the 
Wise, 127 that He may cut off a part of those who disbelieve or 
humble them so that they should return in failure. 128 You have no 
concern in the matter whether He turns to them (mercifully) or 
punishes them; surely they are wrongdoers/ 129 And to Allah 
belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is in the earth. 
He forgives whom He pleases and punishes whom He pleases. 
And Allah is Forgiving, Merciful. 

Section 14: What Success meant for Muslims 

130 O you who believe, do not devour usury, doubling and 
redoubling, and keep your duty to Allah, that you may be success- 
ful. 131 And guard yourselves against the fire which has been 



the promise was given only "as good news, and that your hearts might be at ease 
by it" (8:10). Then it is made further clear there that the believers were strength- 
ened and made firm while terror was cast into the hearts of their enemy. This was 
the result of the action of the angels upon the hearts. 

a (125) The assistance of the angels stated in this verse refers to a third occa- 
sion, when the enemy came "in a headlong manner", all the tribes uniting with the 
Quraish to crush the Muslims. This happened in the battle of Ahzab, or the Allies, 
when the Quraish, numbering about five thousand, with the help of allied forces, 
the total strength being more than ten thousand, suddenly attacked Madinah. The 
dispersal of such a large army when the Muslims were only about fourteen hund- 
red was no doubt due to Divine help, sent through angelic hosts. 

b (127) Although the object of the disbelievers was to extirpate the Muslims 
by war, God's aim was not to destroy all the disbelievers by defeat but to cut off 
their ringleaders and chiefs. The word translated as "a part", taraf, also means the 
leading men. When the leaders of mischief were cut off, the rest would be dis- 
appointed of attaining the object of extirpating Islam, and persecution would 
cease. 

c (128) As a mortal the Prophet might have sometimes desired a severe 
punishment for his enemies; but he is told that it was not his concern, for Allah 
might as well forgive them, even though they deserved punishment. The all- 
comprehensiveness of the Divine mercy expressed in this verse is unapproached 
in sacred literature.

prepared for the disbelievers." 132 And obey Allah and the Messen- 
ger, that you may be shown mercy. 

133 And hasten to forgiveness from your Lord and a Garden, 
as wide as the heavens and the earth; it is prepared for those who 
keep their duty: 134 Those who spend in ease as well as in adversity 
and those who restrain (their) anger and pardon people. And Allah 
loves the doers of good (to others). 135 And those who, when they 
commit an indecency or wrong their souls, remember Allah and 
ask forgiveness for their sins. And who forgives sins but Allah? 
And they do not persist knowingly in what they do. 136 Their reward 
is protection from their Lord, and Gardens in which rivers flow, to 
abide in them. And excellent is the reward of the workers! 

137 Indeed there have been examples before you; so travel in 
the earth and see what was the end of the deniers. i 38 This is a clear 
statement for mankind, and a guidance and an admonition to those 
who would keep their duty. 139 And do not be weak-hearted, nor 
grieve, and you will have the upper hand if you are believers. 140 If 
a wound has afflicted you, a wound like it has also afflicted the 
(disbelieving) people. And We bring these days to people by turns, 
that Allah may know e those who believe and (He may) take wit- 
nesses from among you. And Allah does not love the wrongdoers, 
141 and that He may purge those who believe and deprive the 
disbelievers of blessings. 142 Do you think that you will enter the 
Garden while Allah has not yet known those from among you who 
strive hard (nor) known the steadfast? 143 And certainly you desired 
death before you met it. So indeed you have seen it now as you 
look/ 



a (131) The fire in this case is excessive love of wealth. See chapter 104. 

b (134) Restraining of anger, pardoning, and doing good to others, besides 
being great moral qualities, strengthen the bond of union which is so necessary for 
success. The verse has on many occasions inspired Muslims with the noblest 
thoughts of toleration and charitableness. 

c (140) Allah knows all that is seen or unseen. The knowing here and the not 
knowing in v. 142 refer to the knowledge of the event actually having taken place. 

d (143) This refers to the desire of those who insisted that they should meet 
the enemy in the open field, while the Holy Prophet's own desire was that the 
Muslims should defend themselves within Madinah. 



3 : 144 • SUFFERINGS TO BE MET WITH PERSEVERANCE 95 

Section 15: Sufferings to be met with Perseverance 

144 And Muhammad is but a messenger — messengers have 
already passed away before him. If then he dies or is killed, will 
you turn back upon your heels? " And he who turns back upon his 
heels will do no harm at all to Allah. And Allah will reward the 
grateful. 145 And no soul can die but with Allah's permission — the 
term is fixed. And whoever desires the reward of this world, We 
give him of it, and whoever desires the reward of the Hereafter, 
We give him of it. And We shall reward the grateful. 

146 And how many a prophet has fought, with whom were 
many worshippers of the Lord. So they did not lose heart on 
account of what befell them in Allah's way, nor did they weaken, 
nor did they disgrace themselves. And Allah loves the steadfast. 
147 And their cry was only that they said: Our Lord, grant us pro- 
tection from our sins and our extravagance in our affair, and make 
firm our feet and grant us victory over the disbelieving people. 
148 So Allah gave them the reward of the world and a good reward 
of the Hereafter. And Allah loves the doers of good (to others). 

Section 16: Causes of Misfortune in Battle of Uhud 

149 O you who believe, if you obey those who disbelieve, 
they will make you turn back upon your heels, so you will turn 
back losers. 150 Rather, Allah is your Patron, and He is the Best of 



a (144) The Prophet received severe wounds in the battle of Uhud; there was 
even a rumour that he was killed. Even if the Prophet were killed, Islam was so 
far superior to all forms of faith that the Muslims could not give up Islam. This 
verse served another important purpose at the death of the Prophet. Some of the 
Companions thought that he was not dead. Abu Bakr went in, and seeing that life 
had departed, ascended the pulpit and read this verse, which had a magical effect 
upon his hearers, all of them being convinced that the Prophet had passed away, 
as all prophets had passed away before him. The prophets were but mortals, and 
their span of mortal life must no doubt terminate like that of other mortals. This 
verse affords a conclusive proof that Jesus was also dead; otherwise Abu Bakr's 
argument could not have silenced the doubters of the Prophet's death. 

b (149) The war was carried on only with the object of making the Muslims 
renounce their religion, and hence they could not think of accepting the disbelie- 
vers as their rulers. 



96 3 . THE FAMILY OF AMRAN • 3 : 1 5 1 

the helpers. 151 We will cast terror into the hearts of those who 
disbelieve a because they set up partners with Allah for which He 
has sent down no authority, and their abode is the Fire. And evil is 
the abode of the wrongdoers. 

152 And Allah certainly made good His promise to you when 
you slew them by His permission, until you became weak-hearted 
and disputed about the affair and disobeyed after He had shown 
you what you loved. Some of you desired this world, and some of 
you desired the Hereafter. Then He turned you away from them 
that He might try you; and He has indeed pardoned you. c And 
Allah is Gracious to the believers. 153 When you went away far, 
and paid no heed to anyone, and the Messenger was calling you in 
your rear. So He gave you (another) grief for (your) first grief 
that you might not grieve at what escaped you, nor (at) what befell 
you. And Allah is Aware of what you do. 



a (151) The Muslims were less than one-fourth of their opponents, being at 
the same time not so well equipped as their foes, and in spite of the disorder into 
which the Muslim forces had fallen, the enemy had to flee, leaving the Muslims in 
the field, not even making a show of attacking Madinah, which was quite defence- 
less. This clearly shows that they were terror-stricken. 

b (152-1) The weak-heartedness of a part of the archers who were placed in 
an important position to cut off the enemy's retreat consisted in their disobeying 
the clear orders of the Prophet: "If you see us overcoming the enemy do not leave 
your position, and if you see the enemy overcoming us, do not leave your posi- 
tion". But they fell a prey to the love of the world and left their position to get a 
share in the booty when they saw the enemy fleeing before the Muslim onrush. 

c (152-2) The enemy, who was being pursued, turned against the pursuers on 
seeing the important position of the archers vacated, and the result was that the 
Muslims who were now in disorder on account of the pursuit found themselves 
helpless against the enemy who turned back on them, and some of them who were 
cut off from the main body took to flight. However, God pardoned them as their 
flight was the result of circumstances which were beyond their control. 

d (153) It refers to the Prophet's call, at whom the Muslims now saw that the 
attack of the enemy was directed. So they did not grieve for losing an opportunity 
of pursuing the enemy, but for the dangerous position in which they saw the 
Prophet. 



3:154' CAUSES OF MISFORTUNE IN BATTLE OF UHUD 97 

154 Then after grief He sent down security on you, slumber 
overcoming a group of you," while (there was) another group 
whom their own minds had made anxious — they entertained about 
Allah thoughts of ignorance quite unjustly. They said: Have we 
any hand in the affair? Say: The affair is wholly (in the hands) of 
Allah. They hide within themselves what they would not reveal to 
you. They say: If we had any hand in the affair, we would not have 
been slain here. c Say: Had you remained in your houses, those for 
whom slaughter was ordained would have gone forth to the places 
where they would be slain. And (this happened) that Allah might 
test what was in your minds and that He might purge what was in 
your hearts. And Allah is Knower of what is in the minds. 
i S5 Those of you who turned back on the day when the two armies 
met, only the devil sought to cause them to make a slip on account 
of some deeds they had done, and certainly Allah has pardoned 
them. Surely Allah is Forgiving, Forbearing. 6 



a (154-1) This happened when the enemy departed. The slumber was a sign 
of security. 

b (154-2) These were the disaffected who took no part in fighting. They now 
gave vent to their hidden rancour against the Muslims. The evil thoughts which 
the hypocrites entertained about Allah were that Allah had not helped the 
Muslims. 

c (154-3) The hypocrites sided with the minority whose counsel was that the 
Muslims should not fight the enemy in the open field and should remain besieged 
in Madinah. The majority was, however, in favour of going out and meeting the 
enemy where it had encamped. The Prophet decided that the majority vote must 
be accepted. The hypocrites now argued that the disaster would not have befallen 
the Muslims if their advice as to remaining within the town had been accepted. 
They took no part in fighting but they spoke of the loss of the Muslims as their 
own loss. 

d (154-4) They are given the reply that even if the Muslims had defended 
themselves by remaining in Madinah, those who laid down their lives in the field 
of Uhud would have laid them down in Madinah as well. 

e (155) The persons spoken of here are those who were unable to join the 
main Muslim army and fled to Madinah, or in some other direction. It was a slip 
on their part, not intentional disobedience, and God granted them a free pardon. 



3. THE FAMILY OF AMRAN • 3 : 156 



Section 17: Battle of Uhud afforded a Distinction 

156 O you who believe, do not be like those who disbelieve 
and say of their brethren when they travel in the earth or engage in 
fighting: If they had been with us, they would not have died, or 
been killed;" that Allah may make it a regret in their hearts. And 
Allah gives life and causes death. And Allah is Seer of what you 
do. 157 And if you are killed in Allah's way or you die, surely 
Allah's protection and (His) mercy are better than what they amass. 
158 And if you die or you are killed, to Allah you are gathered. 

159 Thus it is by Allah's mercy that you are gentle to them. 
And if you had been rough, hard-hearted, they would certainly 
have dispersed from around you. b So pardon them and ask protec- 
tion for them, and consult them in (important) matters/ But when 
you have determined, put jour trust in Allah. Surely Allah loves 
those who trust (in Him). 160 If Allah helps you, there is none that 
can overcome you; and if He forsakes you, who is there that can 
help you after Him? And in Allah should the believers put their 
trust. 

161 And it is not for a prophet to act dishonestly. And who- 
ever acts dishonestly will bring his dishonesty on the day of 



a (156) By "their brethren" are meant their relatives who were sincere in 
professing Islam, and who had to lay down their lives in defence of their faith. 

b (159-1) The Quran calls attention to the Prophet's gentle dealing with those 
around him when speaking of his experience in the field of battle as a general, a 
capacity which required him to be very strict in punishing any delinquency. He 
was the ablest general in leading his men, yet his gentle manners and his 
forbearance in dealing with his friends as well as foes stand in remarkable 
contrast with his capacity as a commander in the field of battle. After the Uhud 
trouble he did not speak even a harsh word to those who were guilty of disobey- 
ing his orders. 

c (159-2) It was the majority decision to meet the enemy in the open field 
that had brought about the present trouble, but just at this juncture Divine revela- 
tion affirmed the principle of adhering to decision by counsel. 

d (159-3) Trusting in Allah does not imply inaction. Everything necessary is 
to be done. A course of action must be determined and then in pursuing that 
course trust must be placed in Allah. The consequences must then be accepted. 



3 : 1 62 • BATTLE OF UHUD AFFORDED A DISTINCTION 99 

Resurrection. Then shall every soul be paid back fully what it has 
earned, and they will not be wronged. 162 Is then he who follows 
the pleasure of Allah like him who incurs Allah's displeasure, and 
his abode is hell? And it is an evil destination. 163 There are grades 
with Allah. And Allah is Seer of what they do. 

164 Certainly Allah conferred a favour on the believers when 
He raised among them a Messenger from among themselves, reci- 
ting to them His messages and purifying them, and teaching them 
the Book and the Wisdom, although before that they were surely 
in manifest error. 165 What! When a misfortune befell you, and you 
had inflicted twice as much, you say: From where is this? Say: It 
is from yourselves. Surely Allah is Powerful over all things. 
166 And what befell you on the day when the two armies met was 
by Allah's permission, that He might know the believers, 167 and 
that He might know the hypocrites. And it was said to them: Come, 
fight in Allah's way, or defend yourselves." They said: If we knew 
fighting, we would have followed you. They were on that day 
nearer to disbelief than to belief; they say with their mouths what 
is not in their hearts. And Allah best knows what they conceal. 
168 Those who said of their brethren whilst they (themselves) held 
back: If they had obeyed us, they would not have been killed. Say: 
Avert death from yourselves, if you are truthful. 

169 And do not think of those who are killed in Allah's way 
as dead. Rather, they are alive being provided sustenance from 
their Lord, 170 rejoicing in what Allah has given them out of His 
grace, and they rejoice for the sake of those who, (being left) 
behind them, have not yet joined them, that they have no fear, nor 
shall they grieve. 171 They rejoice for Allah's favour and (His) 
grace, and that Allah does not waste the reward of the believers. 



a (167) The words show clearly that, in the language of the Quran, fighting 
in Allah 's way carries the significance of fighting in self-defence. 



100 3 . THE FAMILY OF AMRAN • 3 : 1 72 

Section 18: Uhud no gain to the Enemy 

172 Those who responded to the call of Allah and the Messen- 
ger after the misfortune had befallen them — for such among 
them who do good and keep their duty is a great reward. 173 Those 
to whom people said: Surely men have gathered against you, so 
fear them; but this increased their faith, and they said: Allah is 
sufficient for us and He is an excellent Guardian. i 74 So they 
returned with favour from Allah and (His) grace; no evil touched 
them, and they followed the pleasure of Allah. And Allah is the 
Lord of mighty grace. 175 It is the devil who only frightens his 
friends, but do not fear them, and fear Me, if you are believers. 

176 And do not let those grieve you who run into disbelief 
hastily; surely they can do no harm to Allah. Allah does not intend 
to assign them any portion in the Hereafter; and for them is a 
grievous punishment. 177 Those who buy disbelief at the price of 
faith can do no harm to Allah, and for them is a painful punish- 
ment. 178 And those who disbelieve should not think that our grant- 
ing them respite is good for themselves. We grant them respite 
only that they may add to their sins; and for them is a humiliating 
punishment. 179 Allah will not leave the believers in the condition 
in which you are until He separates the evil from the good. Nor is 
Allah going to make you acquainted with the unseen, but Allah 
chooses of His messengers whom He pleases. So believe in Allah 
and His messengers. And if you believe and keep your duty, you 
will have a great reward. 

180 And those who are miserly in spending what Allah has 
granted them out of His grace should not think that it is good for 
them. Rather, it is evil for them. They shall have a collar of their 
miserliness on their necks on the day of Resurrection." And Allah's 
is the heritage of the heavens and the earth. And Allah is Aware of 
what you do. 



a (180) The same idea in more general terms, as to the effect of deeds being 
bound to the neck, is expressed in 17:13. Every person carries the effect of his 
deeds with him in this life, but on the day of Resurrection that effect will become 
clearly visible. 



3:181' CARPINGS OF THE PEOPLE OF THE BOOK 1 1 

Section 19: Carpings of the People of the Book 

181 Allah has certainly heard the saying of those who said: 
Allah is poor and we are rich. We shall record what they say, and 
their killing the prophets unjustly, and We shall say: Taste the 
punishment of burning." 182 This is for what your own hands have 
sent ahead, and because Allah is not in the least unjust to the ser- 
vants. 183 Those who say: Allah has enjoined us that we should not 
believe in any messenger until he brings us an offering which is 
consumed by fire.* Say: Indeed messengers came to you before 
me with clear arguments and with what you demand. Why then 
did you try to kill them, if you are truthful? e 184 But if they reject 
you, so indeed were rejected before you messengers who came 
with clear arguments and scriptures and the illuminating Book. 
185 Every soul must taste of death. And you will be paid your reward 
fully only on the day of Resurrection. Then whoever is removed 
far from the Fire and is made to enter the Garden, he indeed attains 
the object. And the life of this world is nothing but a provision of 
vanities. 

186 You will certainly be tried in your property and your 
persons. And you will certainly hear from those who have been 
given the Book before you and from the idolaters much abuse. 
And if you are patient and keep your duty, surely this is an affair 
of great resolution. 187 And when Allah took a covenant from 



a (181) The Jews ridiculed the poverty of the Muslims and their borrowings 
from the Jewish money-lenders. They also ridiculed the raising of funds for the 
defence of the faith by subscriptions. See also 5:64. 

b (183-1) They were referring to the burnt offerings of the Mosaic law. 

c (183-2) The critics are told that they even sought to kill those prophets who 
followed the Mosaic law, who came "with what you demand". 

d (186) This verse speaks of the future, in fact the distant future. The abuses 
which have been heaped on Islam in the past two centuries are without a parallel 
in the whole history of religion. The scurrilous language of Western publications, 
political as well as Christian, and the vituperations of their imitators elsewhere have 
exceeded all moral bounds. But Muslims are taught in this verse to bear all such 
abuse only with patience. (Editor's Note: Hence it is not at all required or even 
allowed in Islam that Muslims should respond by killing or physically attacking 



102 3. THE FAMILY OF AMRAN • 3 : 188 

those who were given the Book: You shall explain it to people and 
shall not hide it. But they threw it behind their backs and took a 
small price for it. And evil is what they buy. 188 Do not think that 
those who exult in what they have done, and love to be praised for 
what they have not done — do not think them to be safe from the 
punishment; and for them is a painful punishment. 189 And Allah's 
is the kingdom of the heavens and the earth. And Allah is Power- 
ful over all things. 

Section 20: Ultimate Triumph of the Faithful 

190 In the creation of the heavens and the earth and the alter- 
nation of the night and the day, there are surely signs for those 
who have understanding, 191 those who remember Allah, standing 
and sitting and (lying) on their sides, and reflect on the creation of 
the heavens and the earth: Our Lord, You have not created this in 
vain! Glory be to You! Save us from the punishment of the Fire. a 
192 0ur Lord, whomsoever You make enter the Fire, him You indeed 
bring to disgrace. And there will be no helpers for the wrongdoers. 
193 0ur Lord, surely we have heard a Crier calling to the faith, 
saying: Believe in your Lord. So we do believe. Our Lord, grant 
us protection from our sins and remove our evils and make us die 
with the righteous. 194 0ur Lord, grant us what You have promised 
us by Your messengers and do not disgrace us on the day of 
Resurrection. Surely You never fail in (Your) promise! 

195 So their Lord accepted their prayer, (saying): I will not let 
the work of any worker among you to be lost, whether male or 



those who vilify Islam and its Holy Prophet. See also 20:130, 33:48, 73:10, 4:140 
and 6:68 which lead to the same conclusion.) 

a (191) This chapter, like the one before it, ends with a prayer for the victory 
of Faith over disbelief and a prediction for its ultimate triumph. Verses 190-191 
describe true believers on the one hand as remembering God in the midst of all 
worldly pursuits, standing and sitting and lying on their sides, being thus fully 
conscious of the Divine presence in all conditions; and, on the other, they set out 
for the conquest of nature with the full consciousness that nothing has been crea- 
ted in vain and that a purpose underlies the whole of creation. This is the grand 
object which Islam sets before its followers, to conquer self by remembrance of 
God and to conquer nature by pursuit of knowledge.

female; each of you is as the other. So those who fled and were 
driven forth from their homes and persecuted in My way and who 
fought and were slain," I shall truly remove their evil and make 
them enter Gardens in which rivers flow — a reward from Allah. 
And with Allah is the best reward. 196 Do not let control in the 
land, of those who disbelieve, deceive you. 197 A brief enjoyment! 
Then their abode is hell. And evil is the resting-place. 198 But those 
who keep their duty to their Lord, for them are Gardens in which 
rivers flow, to abide therein; and entertainment from their Lord. 
And what Allah has in store for the righteous is best. 

199 And among the People of the Book are those who believe 
in Allah and (in) what has been revealed to you and (in) what has 
been revealed to them, humbling themselves before Allah — they 
do not take a small price for the messages of Allah. These it is that 
have their reward with their Lord. Surely Allah is Swift to take 
account! 200 O you who believe, be steadfast and try to excel in 
steadfastness and guard (the frontiers). And keep your duty to 
Allah that you may be successful. 



a (195) Editor's Note: This shows that Muslims were first made to flee, were 
driven from their homes, and were persecuted for worshipping the One God, by 
their enemies, and it was then that they fought in battles in which they were slain. 
And they fought only after war was made upon them; see 22:39-40, 2: 190. 

b (200) While victory is predicted for the Muslims, they are required to be 
humble in the hour of triumph, as at the close of the last chapter. The three quali- 
ties spoken of here, namely, steadfastness or endurance, trying to excel in stead- 
fastness, and guarding, carry a temporal as well as a spiritual significance. They 
require, on the one hand, showing endurance in wars, excelling the enemy in endu- 
rance and to remain in readiness on the frontiers of the Muslim territory to meet 
the enemy, and, on the other, remaining steadfast in keeping away from evil and 
in keeping to obedience to God, trying to excel each other in the quality of 
endurance and to remain on guard against the temptations of the devil. 



Chapter 4 
Ai-Nisa' Women 

This chapter deals chiefly with the rights of women. The battle of Uhud, dealt 
with in the last chapter, had left a large number of orphans and widows 
among the Muslims, and this chapter opens with the subject of duties towards 
them followed by rights of women generally. During the battle of Uhud the 
hypocrites had deserted the Muslims, and this chapter then deals with the 
subject of hypocrisy. Following the battle of Uhud had come the final rupture 
with the Jews as they had sided with the enemy, and the chapter towards its 
end speaks of their transgressions against the Israelite prophets and their 
allegations against Jesus. This chapter was mainly revealed in 4 A.H. 



Section 1 : Duties of Guardians to Orphans 

In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful. 

1 O people, keep your duty to your Lord, Who created you 
from a single being and created its mate of the same (kind)," and 
spread from these two many men and women.* And keep your 
duty to Allah, by Whom you demand one of another (your rights), 
and (to) the ties of relationship. Surely Allah is ever a Watcher 
over you. 



a (1-1) How the first man was created is not stated either in the Quran or in 
the Hadith, nor is the Bible statement accepted that Eve was created from a rib of 
Adam. Muslims do not accept that man was created six thousand years ago. There 
are traditions stating that there were many Adams, even hundreds of thousands of 
Adams, before our Adam. Nor do Muslims accept that our world is the only world 
in this universe; one Imam is reported as saying that in God's universe there are 
twelve thousand systems each bigger than our solar system. The words "Who 
created you from a single being and created its mate of the same" only declare the 
unity of the human race and the equality of the male and the female. Elsewhere 
we are told that for all of you wives are created from yourselves: 'And Allah has 
made wives for you from among yourselves" (16:72). 

b (1-2) "Many men and women" spring from married pairs. The verse does 
not necessarily refer to any parent pair of the whole of mankind. It reminds people 
of the strength of the ties of relationship, an idea mentioned in what follows. 



104 



4 : 2 • DUTIES OF GUARDIANS TO ORPHANS 105 

2 And give to orphans their property, and do not substitute 
worthless (things) for (their) good (ones), nor devour their pro- 
perty (adding) to your own property. This is surely a great sin. a 
3 And if you fear that you cannot do justice to orphans, marry such 
women as seem good to you, two, or three, or four; * but if you 
fear that you will not do justice, then (marry) only one or what 
your right hands possess. c This is more proper that you may not do 
injustice. 4 And give women their dowries as a free gift. But if they 
of themselves are pleased to give you a portion from it, consume it 
with enjoyment and pleasure/ 



a (2) The care of the orphan was one of the earliest injunctions that Islam 
gave, and the Prophet had always shown a deep anxiety for the welfare of the poor 
and the orphans; see 2:220 and 90:15-16. The subject is here introduced in detail 
because of the number of orphans having been greatly increased by the war. 

b (3-1) This passage permits polygamy under certain circumstances; it does 
not prescribe it, nor even permit it unconditionally. This chapter was revealed to 
guide the Muslims under the conditions which followed the battle of Uhud, and 
the last chapter deals with that battle. Now in that battle 70 men out of 700 
Muslims had been killed, and this had greatly decreased the number of males. The 
number was likely to diminish further still in the battles which had yet to be fought. 
Thus many orphans would be left in the charge of widows, who would find it 
difficult to procure the necessary means of support. Hence in the first verse of this 
chapter Muslims are enjoined to respect ties of relationship. As they all came from 
a single ancestor, a breadth is introduced into the idea of relationship. In the second 
verse the care of orphans is particularly stressed. In the third verse we are told that 
if they could not do justice to the orphans, they might marry the widows, whose 
children would thus become their own children; and as the number of women was 
now much greater than the number of men, they were permitted to marry even 
two or three or four women. The Holy Prophet's own action in marrying widows 
corroborates this statement. Marriage with orphan girls is also sanctioned in this 
passage, for there were the same difficulties in their case as in the case of widows, 
and the words are general. See also 4:127. It is not only the preponderance of 
females over males that necessitates polygamy in certain cases, but there is a 
variety of other circumstances, not only for the moral but also for the physical 
welfare of society. 

c (3-2) By what your right hands possess are meant the females who were 
taken prisoners in war. The Quran sanctions marriage with them in this verse. As 
for the conditions of that marriage, see 4:25. 

d (4) It is obligatory in Islam that a "dowry" or nuptial gift should be given 
by the husband to the wife at the time of marriage, whether she is a free woman, 



106 4. WOMEN «4:5 

5 And do not make over your property, which Allah has made 
a (means of) support for you, a to the weak of understanding, and 
maintain them out of it, and clothe them and give them a good 
education. 6 And test the orphans until they reach the age of 
marriage/ Then if you find in them maturity of intellect, make 
over to them their property, and do not consume it extravagantly 
and hastily against their growing up. And whoever is rich, let him 
abstain, and whoever is poor let him consume reasonably. And 
when you make over to them their property, call witnesses in their 
presence. And Allah is enough as a Reckoner. 

7 For men is a share of what the parents and the near relatives 
leave, and for women a share of what the parents and the near 



an orphan girl, or a prisoner of war. So every woman begins her married life as 
the owner of some property, and thus marriage is the means of raising her status. 
The practice has, however, become more or less general to recognize dowry as a 
debt which the husband owes to the wife and which she can claim when she likes. 

a (5-1) By your property is meant the property of the orphans which is under 
your control as guardians. This verse requires guardianship in the case of all who 
are weak of understanding, whether minors or not. While on the one hand the 
Quran lays stress on the transitoriness of this life, on the other it teaches that 
wealth is not a thing to be despised or wasted, because it is the means of support. 

b (5-2) The words "give them a good education" are generally rendered as 
meaning "speak to them good words", but the word qaul (speak) is used to 
express all kinds of deeds. After referring to the maintenance and clothing of the 
orphans in a befitting manner, the Quran now calls attention to another great need 
of theirs which is education. From the first revelation, Islam laid stress on know- 
ledge, read and write (96: 1-5) being its very first message, and the Prophet spoke 
of the acquisition of knowledge as being as great a need of humanity as the acqui- 
sition of wealth. It is the education of orphans that the Quran refers to here, and 
the next verse which enjoins guardians to "test" their wards makes it clear. 

c (6-1) These words show further that the guardian is not only responsible 
for the education of the wards but he is also required to examine them and see 
what progress they have made. According to Abu Hanifah, majority is attained at 
eighteen years, but if maturity of intellect is not attained at eighteen, the limit may 
be extended. These words, moreover, show that marriage should be performed at 
an age after a person has attained majority, not before it, for the age of marriage is 
spoken of as being the age of attaining majority. 

d (6-2) These words allow payment of reasonable wages to the manager of a 
ward's estate out of the ward's property if the manager is not a rich man. 



4:8« LAW OF INHERITANCE 107 

relatives leave, whether it is little or much — an appointed share. " 
8 And when relatives and the orphans and the needy are present at 
the division, give them out of it and speak to them kind words. 
'And let those fear who, if they should leave behind them weakly 
offspring, would fear on their account; so let them observe their 
duty to Allah and let them speak right words. 10 Those who swallow 
the property of the orphans unjustly, they swallow only fire into 
their bellies. And they will burn in blazing fire. 

Section 2: Law of Inheritance 

11 Allah commands you concerning your children: for the male 
is the equal of the portion of two females; but if there are more 
than two females, two-thirds of what the deceased leaves is theirs; 
and if there is one, for her is the half. e And as for his parents, for 
each of them is the sixth of what he leaves, if he has a child; but if 
he has no child and (only) his two parents inherit him, for his 
mother is the third; but if he has brothers, for his mother is the 
sixth, after (payment of) a bequest he may have bequeathed or a 
debt. Your parents and your children, you do not know which of 
them is the nearer to you in benefit. This is an ordinance from 
Allah. Surely Allah is ever Knowing, Wise. 



a (7) Among the Arabs, women and children had no share in inheritance. 
Islam introduced a great reform. The principle laid down here is the basis of the 
Muslim law of inheritance. Children and near relatives, or failing these, distant 
relatives, whether males or females, are the lawful heirs, and the whole of the pro- 
perty does not go to the eldest son. This is in accordance with the broad principles 
of democracy and the brotherhood of man which Islam seeks to establish. 

b (8) That is, distant relatives who for any reason are not entitled to inherit. 

c (11-1) By females are here meant the female children. When daughters are 
the sole heirs they are entitled to a share of two-thirds of the inheritance if there 
are two or more of them (the words "more than two" include the case of two 
daughters). If there is only one daughter she is entitled to a half. 

d (11-2) The parents first take their respective shares, and the residue goes to 
the children, if there are any, failing which, the share of the parents is increased. 
But in case the deceased has brothers, the mother receives the same share as she 
would have received if the deceased had children. In all cases the payment of 
bequests and debts takes precedence of the shares of the heirs. 



108 4. WOMEN «4:12 

12 And yours is half of what your wives leave if they have no 
child; but if they have a child, your share is a fourth of what they 
leave after (payment of) any bequest they may have bequeathed or 
a debt; and theirs is the fourth of what you leave if you have no 
child, but if you have a child, their share is the eighth of what you 
leave after (payment of) a bequest you may have bequeathed or a 
debt." And if a man or a woman, having no children, leaves pro- 
perty to be inherited and he (or she) has a brother or a sister, then 
for each of them is the sixth; but if they are more than that, they 
shall be sharers in the third after (payment of) a bequest that may 
have been bequeathed or a debt not injuring (others). e This is an 
ordinance from Allah, and Allah is Knowing, Forbearing. 

13 These are Allah's limits. And whoever obeys Allah and 
His Messenger, He will admit him to Gardens in which rivers flow, 
to abide in them. And this is the mighty achievement. 14 And 
whoever disobeys Allah and His Messenger and goes beyond His 
limits, He will make him enter fire to abide in it, and for him is a 
humiliating punishment. 

Section 3: Treatment of Women 

15 And as for those of your women who are guilty of an 
indecency, call to witness against them four (witnesses) from 
among you; so if they bear witness, confine them to the houses 
until death takes them away or Allah opens a way for them.'' 



a (12-1) The husband or the wife (and surviving parents) take their fixed 
shares first, and the residue goes to the children. The two-thirds share for two or 
more daughters can only be given when there are neither parents, nor husband or 
wife; otherwise they take the residue, as in the case of sons or sons and daughters. 

b (12-2) This is the case where the deceased has no children but has parents, 
and therefore the brothers and sisters are not the only heirs and their share is only 
one-sixth. See 4:176 for one who leaves neither children nor parents, and there- 
fore the brothers and the sisters take the whole of the inheritance. 

c (12-3) The words not injuring others mean that debts and bequests shall 
not prejudice the rights of the legal heirs. 

d (15) The word "indecency" here signifies immoral conduct short of illicit 
sexual intercourse, the punishment for which is given in 24:2. Women guilty of 



4 : 16 • TREATMENT OF WOMEN 109 

16 And as for the two of you who are guilty of it, give them both a 
slight punishment; then if they repent and amend, turn aside from 
them. a Surely Allah is ever Oft-returning (to mercy), the Merciful. 

17 Repentance with Allah is only for those who do evil in 
ignorance, then turn (to Allah) soon, so these it is to whom Allah 
turns (mercifully). And Allah is ever Knowing, Wise. 18 And repent- 
ance is not for those who go on doing evil deeds, until when death 
comes to one of them, he says: Now I repent; nor (for) those who 
die while they are disbelievers. For such We have prepared a pain- 
ful punishment. 

19 O you who believe, it is not lawful for you to take women 
as heritage against (their) will. c Nor should you cause them hard- 
ship by taking part of what you have given them, unless they are 
guilty of manifest indecency. And treat them kindly. Then if you 



immoral conduct are curtailed of their liberty. If they mend their ways, or being 
unmarried they get married, a way is opened for them by Allah, and they regain 
their liberty. 

a (16) The crime spoken of in this verse is the same as that in the previous 
verse. The committers are two, and though the masculine gender is used, it does 
not imply that they are both necessarily males. Slight punishment has been ex- 
plained as meaning reproving with the tongue. 

b (18) Repentance, according to the Quran, implies an actual change in the 
course of one's life, not the mere utterance of words. In fact, the law stated here 
shows how repentance does away with sins. When the very course of a person's 
life is changed in respect of a particular sin, the tendency to that sin is uprooted. 
But those who continue doing evil until death cannot obtain the benefit of repent- 
ance, because there is no time left for them to improve themselves. 

c (19-1) Among the pre-Islamic Arabs, when a man died his elder son or 
other relations had a right to possess his widow or widows, marrying them them- 
selves if they wished, without settling a dowry on them, marrying them to others, 
or prohibiting them from marriage altogether. This is abolished by these words. 

d (19-2) This passage remedies another evil. Some husbands who were dis- 
satisfied with their wives gave them trouble in order to force them to claim a 
divorce and remit the dowry (i.e., the legally-due nuptial gift from the husband to 
the wife). This is disallowed. If the judge finds that the fault lies actually with the 
husband, he will not allow the dowry to be remitted in his favour. It can only be 
taken back if the woman is guilty of immoral conduct. In such cases, when the 
fault is with the woman, she may be required to return it wholly or in part.

placed abundant good in it. 20 And if you wish to have (one) wife 
in the place of another and you have given one of them a heap of 
gold, take nothing from it. Would you take it by slandering (her) 
and (doing her) manifest wrong? a 2 iAnd how can you take it when 
you have been intimate with each other and they have taken from 
you a strong covenant? 

22 And do not marry women whom your fathers married, 
except what has already passed. This surely is indecent and hate- 
ful; and it is an evil way. 

Section 4: What Women may be taken in Marriage 

23 Forbidden to you are your mothers, and your daughters, 
and your sisters, and your paternal aunts, and your maternal aunts, 
and brother's daughters and sister's daughters, and your mothers 
that have suckled you, and your foster-sisters, and mothers of your 
wives, and your stepdaughters who are in your guardianship (born) 
of your wives with whom you have had sexual relations — but if 
you have not had sexual relations with them, there is no blame on 
you — and the wives of your sons who are of your own loins; and 
that you should have two sisters together, except what has already 
passed. Surely Allah is ever Forgiving, Merciful, 

24 And all married women except those whom your right 
«■ hands possess (are forbidden); c (this is) Allah's ordinance to you. 

a (20) Another social evil was that a husband, wanting to marry another 
woman instead, would accuse his wife of adultery or other gross immorality, thus 
compelling her to obtain a divorce by paying a large sum of money. 

b (21) Marriage is here called a covenant or agreement between the husband 
and the wife. As there can be no agreement unless both parties give their consent 
to it, marriage in Islam can only be entered into with the free consent of the hus- 
band and wife. 

c (24-1) It is thus forbidden to a man to marry a woman who is already 
married. An exception is made, however, regarding those whom your right hands 
possess. This expression may here mean those whom you have lawfully taken in 
marriage, and the meaning would be that all free women are prohibited to you 
except those whom you have lawfully married. Generally by this expression in the

blame on you about what you mutually agree after what is appoin-

25 And whoever among you cannot afford to marry free 
believing women, (let him marry) such of your believing maidens 
as your right hands possess. And Allah knows best your faith — 
you are (sprung) the one from the other. So marry them with the 
permission of their masters, and give them their dowries justly, 
they being chaste, not fornicating, nor taking lovers in secret; then 
if they are guilty of adultery when they are taken in marriage, they 
shall suffer half the punishment for free married women. This is 
for him among you who fears falling into evil. And that you 
abstain is better for you. And Allah is Forgiving, Merciful.

Quran are meant those who are taken prisoners in war. It sometimes happened 
that such prisoners became converts to Islam, and therefore they could not be sent 
back. Such women it was lawful to take in marriage, even though they might not 
have been divorced formally by their former husbands. 

a (24-2) The husband and the wife are free to increase or decrease the 
amount of dowry fixed at the time of marriage by agreement among themselves. 

b (25) There is no verse in the Quran or any instance in the Holy Prophet's 
life sanctioning what is called concubinage. Whenever the establishment of con- 
jugal relations with slave-girls or women prisoners of war is mentioned, their 
taking in marriage is clearly laid down as a condition as in v. 3, v. 24, and this 
verse. Here marriage with such women is allowed under the following conditions: 
(1) they should be Muslims; (2) a man has not the means to marry a free woman, 
and (3) he fears to fall into evil.

yourselves by false means except that it be trading by your mutual 
consent. And do not kill your peopled Surely Allah is ever Merci- 
ful to you. 30 And whoever does this aggressively and unjustly, We

have appointed heirs of whatever parents and near relatives leave. 
And as to those with whom your right hands have ratified agree- 
ments, give them their due. Surely Allah is ever Witness over all 
things. e 



a (28) In Islam all principles of right action are stated with such complete- 
ness, devoid of unnecessary details, that the real burden of man is much lighter 
than in any other religion. It, moreover, points out the right way for man's free- 
dom from the bondage of sin, and thus reduces his burden by saving him from 
falling into evil ways. Man being "created weak" refers to Allah's great mercy in 
having shown him the truth and guidance, because he could not chalk out a way 
for himself which was free from error. 

b (29-1) All illegal methods of acquiring property are forbidden. Only the 
seeking of gain from one another by trading by mutual consent is allowed. The 
passage is particularly directed to guard women's right to property, because it was 
women's and orphans' property that was generally swallowed up unjustly. 

c (29-2) This forbids the killing of anfusa-kum, which means your people or 
yourselves. In the first case, the significance is that life must also be protected; in 
the second case, it is an injunction against suicide which according to the law of 
Islam is a grave sin. (Editor's Note: This injunction also forbids sending "your 
people" on suicide missions to their certain death.) 

rf(31) If a person avoids committing sins, the evil inclinations within him 
die also. Division of sins into kabira (major) and saghira (minor) is baseless. 

e (33) In pre-Islamic days, people entered into covenants with one another, 
by which they undertook to defend and inherit one another. Such inheritance was 
abolished by this verse, and the words give them their due mean the rendering of 
assistance in general. 



4:34' DISAGREEMENT BETWEEN HUSBAND AND WIFE 1 1 3 



Section 6: Disagreement between Husband and Wife 

34 Men are the maintainers of women, with what Allah has 
given some of them above others and with what they spend out of 
their wealth. So the good women are obedient (to Allah)," guard- 
ing the unseen as Allah has guarded. And (as to) those on whose 
part you fear desertion, admonish them, and leave them alone in 
the beds e and turn them away (from wrongdoing). So if they obey 



a (34-1) Obedience here signifies obedience to Allah. This significance of 
the word is made clear by a comparison with 33:31, 33:35, and 66:5. 

b (34-2) This refers to their guarding the husband's rights. The two qualifi- 
cations of a good wife as given here are her obedience to God and chastity. 

c (34-3) The word translated here as desertion, when used about a woman in 
connection with her husband, means her rising against her husband. This is ex- 
plained by the commentators in a number of ways; for example, her leaving the 
husband's place and taking up an abode which he does not like or that the wife 
resisted her husband and hated him and deserted him. The remedy for her correc- 
tion is that she is to be admonished, but if she persists in the wrong course, her 
bed is to be separated, i.e. a cessation of sexual relations. 

rf(34-4) Editor's Note: The words translated as "turn them away" use the 
term darb, and have often been translated as "beat them". Maulana Muhammad 
Ali rendered them as "chastise them" and explained that very slight chastisement 
was allowed only in extreme cases, which should not leave an impression, and 
further that this permission is meant only for the crass type of people in society 
among whom such chastisement is acceptable. However, as he pointed out in his 
footnotes on verses 2:60 and 2:73, the verb darb signifies "all kinds of actions 
except a few"; and apart from striking it is used to mean, for example, marching 
on, setting forth a parable, and likening. In these other senses it is commonly used 
in the Quran. It is used in 43:5 as meaning to turn (something) away: "Shall We 
then turn away the Reminder from you...?", which is how Maulana Muhammad 
Ali and many other translators have rendered this verse. This sense seems to be 
applicable here. Thus the meaning here would be that by admonishing and, if 
necessary, breaking off sexual relations, the husband should turn the wife away 
from her wrong course, or it may mean that if these measures fail he should turn 
her away from himself, i.e. divorce her. It may be added that the Quran clearly 
forbids a man from causing injury to his wife. In its rules for divorce, husbands 
are told about their wives: "retain them with kindness or let them go with kind- 
ness and do not retain them for injury" (2:23 1), "retain them with kindness or part 
from them with kindness ... do not injure them in order to impose hardship upon 
them" (65:2, 6). In fact, only a few verses prior to v. 34 above, in v. 19, husbands 
have been instructed as follows about their wives: "Nor should you cause them

you, do not seek a way against them. Surely Allah is ever Exalted, 
Great. 

35 And if you fear a breach between the two, appoint an 
arbiter from his people and an arbiter from her people. If they both 
desire agreement, Allah will effect harmony between them. Surely 
Allah is ever Knowing, Aware." 

36 And serve Allah, and do not set up any partner with Him, 
and be good to the parents and to the near of kin and the orphans 
and the needy and the neighbour of (your) kin and the alien neigh- 
bour, and the companion in a journey and the traveller and those 
whom your right hands possess. e Surely Allah does not love such 
as are proud, boastful, 3 7who are miserly and tell people to be 
miserly and hide what Allah has given them out of His grace. And 
We have prepared for the disbelievers a humiliating punishment 



hardship . . . And treat them kindly. Then if you hate them, it may be that you 
dislike a thing while Allah has placed abundant good in it". 

a (35) This verse lays down the procedure for divorce. It is not for the 
husband to put away his wife; it is the business of the judge to decide the case. He 
is required to appoint two arbiters, one belonging to the wife's family and the 
other to the husband's. These two arbiters will find out the facts, but their objec- 
tive must be to effect a reconciliation between the parties. If all hopes of recon- 
ciliation fail, a divorce is allowed, but the final decision for divorce rests with the 
judge who is legally entitled to pronounce a divorce. Cases were decided in accor- 
dance with these directions in the early days of Islam. 

b (36-1) The neighbour of kin may mean a neighbour who is a relative or a 
Muslim neighbour, and the alien neighbour is either a neighbour not related or a 
neighbour of an alien religion. Thus the charity of Islam is not limited to one's 
own people or one's own co-religionists, but is extended to others also. {Editor's 
Note: The companion in a journey or the traveller, mentioned after neighbours, 
could belong to any people or any religion. Indeed, the parents, near of kin, orphans 
and needy mentioned at the beginning could also be non-Muslims and it would be 
a Muslim's duty to do good to them regardless of their religion.) 

c (36-2) By those whom your right hands possess are meant all those with 
whose care you are entrusted, so that it includes even animals over which one has 
control. While dealing with the rights of women, the Quran generalizes the law of 
doing good to others, so much so that it requires goodness to be extended even to 
a fellow-traveller. If even companions whose company is so short-lived are to be 
treated generously, how generous must a man be to her who is the companion of 
his whole life! 



4:38* PURIFICATION OF THE SOUL 1 1 5 

— 3S and those who spend their wealth to be seen by people and do 
not believe in Allah nor in the Last Day. And as for him whose 
companion is the devil, an evil companion is he! 

39 And what (harm) would it do them if they believe in Allah 
and the Last Day and spend (on good works) out of what Allah 
has given them? And Allah is ever Knower of them. 40 Surely 
Allah does not wrong (anyone even by) the weight of an atom; 
and if it is a good deed, He multiplies it and gives from Himself a 
great reward. a 

41 But how will it be when We bring from every people a 
witness and bring you as a witness against these? 42 0n that day 
will those who disbelieved and disobeyed the Messenger desire 
that the earth were levelled with them. And they can hide no fact 
from Allah. 

Section 7: Purification of the Soul 

43 O you who believe, do not go near prayer when you are 
intoxicated till you know what you say, c nor after sexual inter- 
course — except you are merely passing by — until you have 
bathed. And if you are sick, or on a journey, or one of you has 



a (40) Such is the ever-recurring description of the preponderance of mercy 
in Divine nature: good done is always multiplied and evil nullified by God. 

b (41) The prophet sent to a people is frequently spoken of as being a wit- 
ness in respect of them, and by these are here meant the followers of the Holy 
Prophet Muhammad. It appears that the people spoken of here are Muslims who 
disobey the Prophet, and hence the Prophet's anxiety for the later generations of 
his followers. This is made clear in the verse that follows in the words those who 
disbelieved and disobeyed the Messenger. Disobedience amounts to disbelief in 
practice. 

c (43-1) The prohibition against praying when intoxicated was a step towards 
the total prohibition of drink, for the necessity of going to prayer five times a day 
would leave little opportunity for indulgence in drink. The verse also makes it 
clear that one must know the meaning of what one says when praying to God. 

d (43-2) Going near prayer may signify going into mosques, and the 
meaning in that case would be unless you pass (through the mosques) as by a 
way.

women," and you cannot find water, then resort to pure earth and 
wipe your faces and your hands (with it). Surely Allah is ever 
Pardoning, Forgiving. 

44 Do you not see those to whom a portion of the Book was 
given? They buy error and desire to make you go astray from the 
(right) way. 45 And Allah best knows your enemies. And Allah is 
sufficient as a Friend and Allah is sufficient as a Helper. 

46 Some of those who are Jews alter words from their places e 
and say, We have heard and we disobey; and (say), Hear without 
being made to hear, and (say), Ra 'i-nd, distorting with their tongues 
and slandering religion. And if they had said, We hear and we 
obey, and listen, and unzur-na, it would have been better for them 
and more upright; but Allah has cursed them on account of their 
disbelief, so they do not believe except a little. 47 you who have 
been given the Book, believe in what We have revealed, verifying 
what you (already) have, 6 before We destroy the leaders and turn 
them on their backs, or curse them as We cursed the Sabbath- 
breakers. And the command of Allah is ever executed. 

48 Surely Allah does not forgive that a partner should be set 
up with Him, and forgives all besides that to whom He pleases. 
And whoever sets up a partner with Allah, he devises indeed a 



a (43-3) Literally, "you have touched women", which is a euphemism for 
sexual intercourse. Many of the fine phrases used in the Quran to express this 
delicate relation were unknown to the Arabs. 

b (43-4) Tayammum means striking both hands on pure earth, or anything 
containing pure dust, and then passing the hands over the face and the backs of 
the hands. When water is not found, or is likely to do harm, tayammum suffices 
instead of ablution before prayer. 

c (46-1) The corruption of the previous books is constantly referred to in the 
Quran, and, as the words clearly show, it implies a corruption of the text as well 
as a false rendering of it. 

d (46-2) See 2: 104 and footnote. 

e (47) The verification referred to here and elsewhere implies only a verifi- 
cation of the general principles and the prophecies contained in the earlier books.

great sin. a 49 Have you not seen those who attribute purity to them- 
selves? ' Rather, Allah purifies whom He pleases, and they will 
not be dealt with unjustly in the least. 50 See how they forge lies 
against Allah! And sufficient is this as a manifest sin. 

Section 8: Kingdom granted to Abraham's Descendants 

51 Have you not seen those to whom a portion of the Book 
was given? They believe in sorcery and diviners c and say of those 
who disbelieve: These are better guided in the path than those who 
believe. 52 Those are they whom Allah has cursed. And whomever 
Allah curses, you will not find a helper for him. 53 0r have they a 
share in the kingdom? But then they would not give to people 
even the speck on a date-stone. 54 0r do they envy the people for 
what Allah has given them of His grace? But indeed We have 
given to Abraham's children the Book and the Wisdom, and We 
have given them a grand kingdom. e 55 So some of them believe in 



a (48) Shirk or setting up partners with Allah is spoken of as the gravest sin. 
Wrong belief in false deities lowers the dignity of man. Man is made to rule 
nature itself and all creatures, but when he lowers himself before creatures lower 
than himself, he sets at naught the very purpose of his creation. It should be noted 
that shirk or setting up gods with God also includes blind obedience rendered to 
leaders; see 9:31 and also the next footnote. It should also be noted that if a 
person guilty of shirk repents of it before his death then all his sins including shirk 
are forgiven because he gives a new turn to his life. Even those who die while 
guilty of shirk will, after suffering the consequences of their deeds in the after life, 
be received into the mercy of God. 

b (49) These are the priests, doctors of law and monks who demanded blind 
obedience from their followers, and include such ulama, shaikhs and pirs among 
the Muslims as well. 

c (51) These words seem to refer to the general debasement of the Jews, who 
believed in all kinds of enchantment, divination, and sorcery, and had long bidden 
farewell in practice to the pure monotheism of Moses. 

d (53) This shows that a temporal or worldly kingdom cannot be granted to a 
nation which would not deal liberally with others. 

e (54) By the people are meant the Arabs. The promised kingdom was still in 
Abraham's seed, but was now transferred from the descendants of Israel to those 
of Ishmael, in accordance with the covenant made with Abraham.

cient to burn. 

56 Those who disbelieve in Our Messages, We shall make 
them enter Fire. As often as their skins are burned, We shall change 
them for other skins, that they may taste the punishment. Surely 
Allah is ever Mighty, Wise. 57 And those who believe and do good 
deeds, We shall make them enter Gardens in which rivers flow, to 
abide in them forever. They will have therein pure companions 
and We shall make them enter a pleasant shade. 

58 Surely Allah commands you to make over trusts to those 
worthy of them, and that when you judge between people, you 
judge with justice. 6 Surely Allah instructs you with what is 
excellent. Surely Allah is ever Hearing, Seeing. 59 you who 
believe, obey Allah and obey the Messenger and those in authority 
from among you; then if you quarrel about anything, refer it to 
Allah and the Messenger, if you believe in Allah and the Last Day. e 
This is best and more suitable to (achieve) the end. 

Section 9: The Prophet must be obeyed 

60 Have you not seen those who assert that they believe in 
what has been revealed to you and what was revealed before you? 
They desire to seek the judgment of the devil, though they have 



a (55) By "him" is meant the Holy Prophet Muhammad, who was now the 
true exponent of Abraham's religion. 

b (58) Muslims, having been granted worldly rule, are here told to entrust 
the affairs of State to people who are worthy of this responsibility, while the autho- 
rities and judges so entrusted are required to judge with justice. 

c (59) This verse lays down three important rules in matters relating to the 
welfare of the Muslim community and to affairs of State. These are obedience to 
God and His Messenger in the first place; secondly, obedience to those in autho- 
rity from among the Muslims; and thirdly, referring matters to God and His 
Messenger in cases of dispute with those in authority. God and His Messenger are 
thus the final authority. It is especially in matters religious that differences would 
arise, in which case it would be necessary to refer the matter to God and His 
Messenger; in other words to the Quran and Hadith. In case of Muslims living 
under non-Muslim authority, Islam requires them to abide by the laws of the land. 



4:61' THE PROPHET MUST BE OBEYED 1 1 9 

been commanded to deny him. And the devil desires to lead them 
far astray. 61 And when it is said to them, Come to what Allah has 
revealed and to the Messenger, you see the hypocrites turning away 
from you with aversion. 62 But how is it that when a misfortune 
befalls them on account of what their hands have already done, 
they come to you swearing by Allah: We desired nothing but good 
and concord? 63 These are they, the secrets of whose hearts Allah 
knows; so turn aside from them and admonish them and speak to 
them effective words concerning themselves. 

64 And We sent no messenger but that he should be obeyed 
by Allah's command. And if they had, when they wronged them- 
selves, come to you and asked forgiveness of Allah, and the 
Messenger had (also) asked forgiveness for them, they would have 
found Allah Oft-returning (to mercy), merciful. 65 But no, by your 
Lord! they do not believe until they make you a judge of what is in 
dispute between them, then find no reluctance in their hearts as to 
what you decide and submit with full submission. 66 And if We had 
ordained for them: Lay down your lives or go forth from your 
homes, they would not have done it except a few of them." And if 
they had done what they are exhorted to do, it would certainly 
have been better for them and more strengthening, 67 and then We 
would certainly have given them from Ourselves a great reward, 
68 and We would certainly have guided them in the right path. 

69 And whoever obeys Allah and the Messenger, they are with 
those upon whom Allah has bestowed favours from among the 
prophets and the truthful and the faithful and the righteous, and a 
goodly company are they! 



a (66) The Companions of the Holy Prophet had to lay down their lives in 
defence of their faith, and had to leave their homes for the sake of their religion. 
But the hypocrites at Madinah were too weak of heart to undergo such hardships. 
They were only required to contribute to the struggle which was being carried on 
for national defence and to obey the Prophet' s orders which was a far easier task, 
but they did not do even this. 

b (69) Those upon whom Allah has bestowed favours are spoken of as 
belonging to four classes: (1) the prophets; (2) the truthful — those who are true 
in their sayings and their belief, and confirm their truth by their deeds or acting; 
(3) the faithful — those who bear witness to the truth both by words and deeds, 



120 4. WOMEN • 4 : 70 

70 Such is the grace from Allah, and Allah is sufficient as 
Knower. 

Section 10: Believers must defend Themselves 

71 O you who believe, take your precautions, then go forth in 
detachments or go forth in a body. 72 And among you is he who 
would hang back. Then if a misfortune befalls you, he says: Allah 
indeed bestowed a favour on me as I was not present with them. 
73 And if bounty from Allah comes to you, he would cry, as if there 
were no friendship between you and him: If only I had been with 
them, then I should have achieved a mighty success! 74 So let those 
fight in the way of Allah who sell this world's life for the Here- 
after. And whoever fights in the way of Allah, whether he is killed 
or is victorious, We shall grant him a mighty reward. 

75 And what reason have you not to fight in the way of Allah, 
and of the weak among the men and the women and the children, 
who say: Our Lord, take us out of this town, whose people are 
oppressors, and grant us from Yourself a friend, and grant us from 
Yourself a helper!" 76 Those who believe fight in the way of Allah, 
and those who disbelieve fight in the way of the devil. So fight 
against the friends of the devil; surely the struggle of the devil is 
ever weak. 



and one slain in defence of his religion is included because he too gives evidence 
of the truth of religion by laying down his life; (4) the righteous or those who 
stick to the right course in all their deeds, come what may. Those who obey Allah 
and the Messenger are here told that they are with the perfect ones who belong to 
these four classes. Thus this verse promises to those who have not attained to per- 
fection the company, in the life to come, of those who have attained to perfection 
when the former have done their best to obey God and His Messenger. It may be 
added that no one can become a prophet by obeying the Holy Prophet. If this were 
true, not only would all the truthful and the faithful and the righteous be prophets, 
because they perfectly obeyed Allah and His Messenger, but even all those who 
tried to follow them would also be prophets which is absurd. 

a (75) This explains what is meant by fighting in the way of Allah. While 
most of the believers who had the means had escaped from Makkah, there 
remained those who were weak and unable to undertake a journey. These were 
still persecuted and oppressed at Makkah. Fighting to deliver them from the per- 
secution of their oppressors was really fighting in the way of Allah. 



4 : 77 • ATTITUDE OF THE HYPOCRITES 121 

Section 1 1 : Attitude of the Hypocrites 

77 Have you not seen those to whom it was said: Withhold 
your hands, and keep up prayer and give the due charity. But when 
fighting is prescribed for them, then some of them fear men as 
they ought to fear Allah, or with a greater fear, and say: Our Lord, 
why have You ordained fighting for us? Would You not grant us 
respite for a little while?" Say: The enjoyment of this world is 
short, and the Hereafter is better for him who keeps his duty. And 
you will not be dealt with unjustly in the least. 78 Wherever you are, 
death will overtake you, though you are in towers, raised high. 
And if good befalls them, they say: This is from Allah; and if a 
misfortune befalls them, they say: This is from you. Say: All is 
from Allah. But what is the matter with these people that they 
make no effort to understand anything? 79 Whatever good befalls 
you (O man), it is from Allah, and whatever misfortune befalls you, 
it is from yourself. And We have sent you (O Prophet) to man- 
kind as a Messenger. And Allah is sufficient as a witness. 

80 Whoever obeys the Messenger, he indeed obeys Allah. 
And whoever turns away, We have not sent you as a keeper over 
them. 81 And they say: Obedience. But when they go out from your 
presence, a group of them plan by night doing otherwise than what 
you say. And Allah writes down what they plan by night, so turn 
aside from them and trust in Allah. And Allah is sufficient as hav- 
ing charge of affairs. 82 Will they not then meditate on the Quran? 



a (77) Had there been any hope of plunder to animate the ranks of Muslims, 
those who loved this world most, who are here called the hypocrites, would have 
been foremost in fighting; but as they knew that they were fighting against odds, 
they considered acting on this order as equivalent to courting death, and requested 
to be granted a respite until they died a natural death. 

b (79) Good and evil, or benefits and misfortunes, proceed from Allah; but 
while He sends benefits from Himself, i.e. out of His beneficence, no evil or mis- 
fortune afflicts a man unless his own hands have called for it. The previous verse 
states that the hypocrites attributed their misfortunes to the Prophet; they are told, 
in the words "All is from Allah", that misfortunes were sent by Allah. This verse 
tells them that, though sent by Allah, the immediate cause of these misfortunes 
was to be found in their own doings. 



122 4. WOMEN • 4 : 83 

And if it were from any other than Allah, they would have found 
in it many a discrepancy. a 83 But if any news of security or fear 
comes to them, they spread it about. And if they had referred it to 
the Messenger and to those in authority among them, those of 
them who can search out knowledge of it would have known it. 
And if it were not for the grace of Allah upon you and His mercy, 
you would certainly have followed the devil except a few. 84 Fight 
then in Allah's way — you are not responsible except for yourself; 
and urge on the believers. It may be that Allah will restrain the 
fighting of those who disbelieve. And Allah is stronger in prowess 
and stronger to give exemplary punishment. 

85 Whoever intercedes in a good cause has a share of it, and 
whoever intercedes in an evil cause has a portion of it. And Allah 
is ever Keeper over all things. c 86 And when you are greeted with 
a greeting, greet with one better than it, or return it. Surely Allah 



a (82) The Quran was not written out and given on one occasion, but it con- 
tinued to be delivered in small portions during twenty-three years under the most 
varying circumstances. But what is striking throughout the entire revelation is that 
it keeps up one and the same strain — absolute submission to Allah, entire trust in 
Him, perfect confidence of future success, a liberal view of humanity, an attitude 
of charity towards all nations and religions, and goodness to all alike. The spirit of 
the revelations to the solitary, persecuted, and rejected preacher of Makkah does 
not differ in these and a hundred other particulars from the spirit of the revelations 
to the sole temporal and spiritual monarch of Arabia. 

b (84) The primary duty to defend Islam lay on the Holy Prophet alone, as 
against all the forces of Arabia. This shows that he never put any trust in the 
prowess of his followers, and his confidence was based solely on Divine help. 

c (85) The meaning is that he who joins himself to another and assists him, 
and becomes to him as one of a pair or an intercessor in doing good or evil, and 
thus aids him and strengthens him, partakes with him the benefit or the harm of it. 
Interceding here also implies that one institutes for another a way of good or a 
way of evil which the other imitates, and thus becomes to him as one of a pair. 
The connection is clear; the Prophet made himself an example of good for others 
to imitate or to aid him. For the meaning of intercession see 2:255 footnote 1. 

d (86) A greeting is a prayer for the good of another; tahiyyah, the word used 
for it here, meaning originally a prayer for one 's long life. The minimum require- 
ment is that a greeting must be returned in the same words. What is really aimed 
at is that a Muslim should always wish good for, or do good to, his brother, and 
the other is required to do greater good in return. 



4 : 87 • HOW TO DEAL WITH THE HYPOCRITES 123 

ever takes account of all things. 87 Allah, there is no god but He — 
He will certainly gather you together on the day of Resurrection, 
there is no doubt in it. And who is more true in word than Allah? 

Section 12: How to deal with the Hypocrites 

88 Why should you, then, be two parties in relation to the 
hypocrites while Allah has made them return (to disbelief) for 
what they have earned? Do you desire to guide him whom Allah 
leaves in error? And whomsoever Allah leaves in error you cannot 
find a way for him. 89 They long that you should disbelieve as they 
have disbelieved so that you might be on the same level; so do not 
take from among them friends until they flee (their homes) in 
Allah's way. Then if they turn back (to hostility), seize them and 
kill them wherever you find them, and take no friend nor helper 
from among them, 90 except those who join a people between whom 
and you there is an alliance, or who come to you, their hearts 
shrinking from fighting you or fighting their own people. And if 
Allah had pleased, He would have given them power over you, so 
that they would have fought you. So if they withdraw from you 
and do not fight you and offer you peace, then Allah allows you no 
way against them." 91 You will find others who desire to be secure 
from you and secure from their own people. Whenever they are 
made to return to hostility, they are plunged into it. So if they do 
not withdraw from you, nor offer you peace and restrain their 
hands, then seize them and kill them wherever you find them. 
And against these We have given you a clear authority. 



a (90) This shows clearly that even waverers were not to be killed or fought 
against if they refrained from fighting, though they may have gone over to 
disbelief after accepting Islam. The persons referred to in this verse were disbelie- 
vers and not Muslims. Note also that we have here the clear injunction that if any 
people offered peace, they were not to be fought against. 

b (91) Editor's Note: The meaning of the words "then seize them and kill 
them wherever you find them" is clearly shown by the preceding text: "So if they 
do not withdraw from you, nor offer you peace and restrain their hands". Those 
enemies are meant who themselves attacked the Muslims first. The words "kill 
them wherever you find them" also occur in 2:190-191, preceded by: "And fight 
in the way of Allah against those who fight against you but do not be aggressive".

Section 13: Murderer of a Muslim 

92 And a believer would not kill a believer except by mistake." 
And he who kills a believer by mistake should free a believing 
slave, and blood-money should be paid to his people unless they 
forgo it as charity. But if he is from a tribe hostile to you and he is 
a believer, the freeing of a believing slave (is sufficient). And if he 
is from a tribe between whom and you there is a covenant, the 
blood-money should be paid to his people along with the freeing 
of a believing slave; but he who has not the means should fast for 
two months successively: a penance from Allah. And Allah is ever 
Knowing, Wise. 93 And whoever kills a believer intentionally, his 
punishment is hell, abiding in it; and Allah is furious with him and 
He has cursed him and prepared for him a grievous punishment. 

94 O you who believe, when you go forth (to fight) in Allah's 
way, make investigation, and do not say to anyone who offers you 
salutation, Fou are not a believer, seeking the good of this world's 
life. e But with Allah there are abundant gains. You too were such 
before, then Allah conferred a benefit on you; so make investiga- 
tion. Surely Allah is ever Aware of what you do. 95 Those who 
hold back from among the believers, not disabled by injury, and 
those who strive hard in Allah's way with their property and their 



a (92) The man who killed a believer intentionally could not be a believer. 
Disbelievers often made use of ruses, professing belief in Islam and thus tempting 
Muslims to go over to them as religious teachers, and afterwards murdering them. 

b (93) The commentators are agreed that this verse speaks of a disbeliever 
who murders a believer. In fact, the word intentionally stands here for murdering 
a man because he is a believer, as this was what the disbelievers often did. 

c (94) The original word for salutation is salam (meaning peace). The first 
word of the Muslim salutation stands therefore for the Muslim salutation. The 
Muslims were surrounded by enemies on all sides, yet they were told not to pre- 
sume that every Arab tribe belonged to the enemy camp but were to make an 
investigation first. Even when a man belonging to an enemy tribe offered the 
Muslim salutation, to show that he was a Muslim, he was to be taken as a brother 
Muslim and could not be dealt with as an enemy. Incidentally, it lays down the 
principle that no Muslim can be called a kafir, not even the man whose claim to 
Islam is borne out only by offering the Muslim salutation.

persons, are not equal. Allah has made those who strive with their 
property and their persons to excel those who hold back by a (high) 
degree. And to each Allah has promised good. And Allah has 
granted to those who strive above those who hold back a mighty 
reward — "(high) degrees from Him and protection and mercy. 
And Allah is ever Forgiving, Merciful. 

Section 14: Muslims who remained with the Enemy 

97 (As for) those whom the angels cause to die while they are 
unjust to themselves, (the angels) will say: What were you doing? 
They will say: We were weak in the earth. (The angels) will say: 
Was not Allah's earth spacious, so that you could have migrated 
in it? So these it is whose refuge is hell — and it is an evil 
destination." 98 Except the weak from among the men and the 
women and the children who do not have the means, nor can they 
find a way (to escape); "so these, it may be that Allah will pardon 
them. And Allah is ever Pardoning, Forgiving. 100 And whoever 
flees in Allah's way, he will find in the earth many a place of 
escape and abundant resources. And whoever goes forth from his 
home fleeing to Allah and His Messenger, then death overtakes 
him, his reward is indeed with Allah. And Allah is ever Forgiving, 
Merciful. 

Section 15: Prayer when Fighting 

101 And when you journey in the earth, there is no blame on 
you if you shorten the prayer, if you fear that those who disbelieve 
will give you trouble.* Surely the disbelievers are an open enemy 
to you. 102 And when you are among them and lead the prayer for

convinced of the truth of Islam, but chose to remain among the disbelievers, who 
did not allow them to give expression to their beliefs, despite having the means to 
join the Muslims and avow Islam openly. 

b (101) The prayer service on a journey is shorter than the ordinary prayer 
service in the zuhr (midday), 'asr (afternoon) and 'isha' (night) prayers but the 
shortening of prayer as mentioned in this verse is quite different from the ordinary 
shorter service of the journey, and its details are given in the next verse. 



126 4. WOMEN • 4 : 103 

them, let a group of them stand up with you, and let them take 
their arms. Then when they have performed their prostration, let 
them go to your rear, and let another group who have not prayed 
come forward and pray with you, and let them take their pre- 
cautions and their arms. Those who disbelieve long that you may 
neglect your arms and your baggage, that they may attack you 
with a sudden united attack. And there is no blame on you, if you 
are inconvenienced on account of rain or if you are sick, to put 
away your arms; and take your precautions. Surely Allah has pre- 
pared a humiliating punishment for the disbelievers." 103 So when 
you have finished the prayer, remember Allah standing and sitting 
and reclining. But when you are secure (from danger) keep up 
(regular) prayer. Prayer indeed has been enjoined on the believers 
at fixed times. 4 104 And do not be weak-hearted in pursuit of the 
enemy. If you suffer they (too) suffer as you suffer, and you hope 
from Allah what they do not hope. And Allah is ever Knowing, 
Wise. 

Section 16: Hypocrites are Dishonest 

105 Surely We have revealed the Book to you with truth that 
you may judge between people by means of what Allah has taught 
you. And do not be one pleading the cause of the dishonest/ 



a (102) This verse and the previous one show the importance of prayer and 
of offering prayer in congregation in Islam, which could not be neglected even on 
the field of battle. 

b (103) The hours of prayer were fixed by the Prophet under Divine guid- 
ance, and the observance of the hours of prayer is an essential part of the due 
observance of prayer. It is this feature of the Islamic prayer which makes it a 
unique force in the unification of the human race. 

c (105) The occasion of the revelation of these verses was a dispute between 
a Muslim and a Jew, in which judgment was given by the Prophet against the 
Muslim. It was a time when every Muslim hand was sorely needed for the 
defence of Islam, and a verdict against a man supported by his whole tribe meant 
the loss of that tribe. But such considerations did not carry any weight with the 
Prophet. Thus these verses lay down the broad principle that dishonesty must be 
punished, and the balance of justice must be held equal between Muslims and 
non-Muslims and between friends and foes.

106 and ask the forgiveness of Allah." Surely Allah is ever For- 
giving, Merciful. 107 And do not contend on behalf of those who 
act unfaithfully to their souls. Surely Allah does not love him who 
is treacherous, sinful: 108 They seek to hide from people and they 
cannot hide from Allah, and He is with them when they counsel 
by night matters which do not please Him. And Allah ever encom- 
passes what they do. 109 Look! You are they who may contend on 
their behalf in this world's life, but who will contend with Allah 
on their behalf on the day of Resurrection, or who will have charge 
of their affairs? 

110 And whoever does evil or wrongs his soul, then asks 
forgiveness of Allah, will find Allah Forgiving, Merciful. ni And 
whoever commits a sin, commits it only against himself. And Allah 
is ever Knowing, Wise. 112 And whoever commits a fault or a sin, 
then accuses of it one innocent, he indeed takes upon himself the 
burden of a slander and a manifest sin. 

Section 17: Secret Counsels of the Hypocrites 

113 And if it were not for Allah's grace upon you and His 
mercy, a group of them had certainly aimed to ruin you. And they 
ruin only themselves, and they cannot harm you in any way. And 
Allah has revealed to you the Book and the Wisdom, and taught 
you what you did not know, and Allah's grace on you is very 
great. 114 There is no good in most of their secret counsels except 
(in) him who enjoins charity or goodness or reconciliation 
between people. And whoever does this, seeking Allah's pleasure, 
We shall give him a mighty reward. 115 And whoever acts hostilely 
to the Messenger after guidance has become manifest to him and 
follows other than the way of the believers, We turn him to that to 



a (106) The injunction in this as well as the previous verse is meant for 
every Muslim who is called upon to act as a judge. He must be strictly just as 
between his own people and aliens, and must further ask the protection of Allah 
from being guilty of an act of injustice, even unknowingly. 

b (108) Those who supported the guilty man are condemned here as hypo- 
crites. The same subject is continued in the verses that follow.

which he (himself) turns and make him enter hell; and it is an evil 
destination." 

Section 18: Idolatry condemned 

116 Surely Allah does not forgive setting up partners with 
Him, and He forgives all besides this to whom He pleases. And 
whoever sets up a partner with Allah, he indeed goes far astray. 
117 Besides Him they call on nothing but female divinities and they 
call on nothing but a rebellious devil, 118 whom Allah has cursed. 
And he said: Certainly I will take of Your servants an appointed 
portion; 119 and certainly I will lead them astray and excite in them 
vain desires and bid them so that they will slit the ears of the 
cattle^ and bid them so that they will alter Allah's creation. And 
whoever takes the devil for a friend, forsaking Allah, he indeed 
suffers a manifest loss. 120 He promises them and excites vain 
desires in them. And the devil promises them only to deceive. 
121 These — their refuge is hell, and they will find no way of 
escape from it. 

122 And those who believe and do good, We shall make them 
enter Gardens in which rivers flow, to abide in them forever. It is 



a (115) This verse clearly speaks of the hypocrites, who followed a way 
other than the way of the believers. Only a distortion of the words could make 
them signify that it was a sin to differ with the majority of the Muslims on any 
question of religion. 

b (117) The word translated here as "female divinities" can signify inanimate 
things, such as trees and stones and wood, which they worshipped, as well as 
idols because they named the idols as females. 

c (119-1) The practice of slitting or cutting off the ear of certain animals was 
a prevalent form of polytheism in Arabia, for such an animal was looked upon as 
devoted to certain idols. 

d (119-2) A comparison with 30:30 will show clearly that by Allah's crea- 
tion is here meant the religion of Allah, the natural religion of man. By the devil's 
changing the creation of Allah is therefore meant the changing of the natural reli- 
gion of man which requires obedience to Allah and His laws. Some commentators 
understand by changing the creation of Allah the using of His created things for 
an object other than that for which they were created, and worshipping objects 
such as the sun, etc., which were really created to be subservient to man. 



4:123' EQUITABLE DEALINGS 129 

Allah's promise, in truth. And who is more truthful in word than 
Allah? 123 It will not be in accordance with your vain desires nor 
the vain desires of the People of the Book. Whoever does evil, 
will be recompensed for it and will not find for himself besides 
Allah a friend or a helper." 124 And whoever does good deeds, 
whether male or female, and is a believer — these will enter the 
Garden, and they will not be dealt with unjustly in the least. 
125 And who is better in religion than he who submits himself entirely 
to Allah while doing good (to others) and follows the faith of 
Abraham, the upright one? And Allah took Abraham for a friend. 
126 And to Allah belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever 
is in the earth. And Allah ever encompasses all things. 

Section 19: Equitable Dealings with Orphans and Widows 

127 And they ask you a decision about women. Say: Allah 
makes known to you His decision concerning them; and what is 
recited to you in the Book is concerning widowed women, whom 
you do not give what is appointed for them, while you are not 
inclined to marry them, nor to the weak among children, and that 
you should deal justly with orphans. And whatever good you do, 
Allah is surely ever Knower of it. 128 And if a woman fears 



a (123) Editor's Note: Divine reward is not bestowed upon anyone in accor- 
dance with their vain desires, whether they are Muslims or Jews or Christians. 
People are judged by their deeds, and rewarded or punished accordingly. 

b (127) It is stated here that a decision regarding the doing of good to 
women, to weak children and to orphans has already been given (see 4: 1-10). The 
words "and what is recited to you in the Book is concerning widowed women, 
whom you do not give what is appointed for them while you are not inclined to 
marry them" refer to 4:3. The meaning is that the order given in 4:3 in the words 
"if you fear that you cannot do justice to orphans marry such women as seem 
good to you" relates to orphans of the women (or to widows) whom their share in 
inheritance was denied, both their share and the share of their orphan children, nor 
were people inclined to marry them owing to the burden which they brought with 
them in the shape of their children. So the permission was given that they may 
marry such women, even up to four. Widows and their orphaned children used to 
receive no share of inheritance. The Quran brought about a great change: it re- 
quired the giving of inheritance both to women and their orphaned children, and it 
also recommended that such women should be taken in marriage.

ill-usage from her husband or desertion, there is no blame on the 
two of them if they effect a reconciliation between them. And 
reconciliation is better. And greed is met with in (people's) minds. 
And if you do good (to others) and keep your duty, surely Allah is 
ever Aware of what you do. 129 And you cannot do justice between 
wives, even though you wish (it), but do not be disinclined (from 
one) with total disinclination, so that you leave her in suspense. 
And if you are reconciled and keep your duty, surely Allah is ever 
Forgiving, Merciful. 130 And if they separate, Allah will render 
them both free from want out of His ampleness. And Allah is ever 
Ample-giving, Wise. 

131 And to Allah belongs whatever is in the heavens and 
whatever is in the earth. And certainly We charged those who were 
given the Book before you, and (We also charge) you, to keep 
your duty to Allah. And if you disbelieve, surely to Allah belongs 
whatever is in the heavens and whatever is in the earth. And Allah 
is ever Self-sufficient, Praiseworthy. 132 And to Allah belongs what- 
ever is in the heavens and whatever is in the earth. And Allah is 
sufficient as having charge of affairs. 133 If He please, He will take 
you away, O people, and bring others. And Allah is ever Powerful 
to do that. i 34 Whoever desires the reward of this world — then 
with Allah is the reward of this world and the Hereafter. And 
Allah is ever Hearing, Seeing. 

Section 20: Hypocrisy condemned 

135 O you who believe, be maintainers of justice, bearers of 
witness for Allah, even if it is against your own selves or (your) 
parents or near relatives — whether he is rich or poor, Allah has a 
better right over them both." So do not follow (your) low desires, 
that you deviate. And if you distort (the truth) or turn away (from 
it), surely Allah is ever Aware of what you do. 



a (135) "Allah has a better right over them" means that they should be dealt 
with justly. Thus, neither ties of kinship and love nor considerations of fear, 
favour, or compassion should make one swerve a hair's breadth from the truth. 



4:136' END OF THE HYPOCRITES 1 3 1 

136 O you who believe, believe in Allah and His Messenger 
and the Book which He has revealed to His Messenger and the 
Book which He revealed before. And whoever disbelieves in Allah 
and His angels and His Books and His messengers and the Last 
Day, he indeed strays far away. 137 Those who believe then 
disbelieve, again believe and again disbelieve, then increase in 
disbelief, Allah will never forgive them nor guide them in the 
(right) way. a 138 Give news to the hypocrites that for them is a 
painful punishment — 139 those who take disbelievers for friends 
rather than believers. Do they seek for might from them? Might 
surely belongs wholly to Allah. 

140 And indeed He has revealed to you in the Book that when 
you hear Allah's messages disbelieved in and mocked at, do not 
sit with them until they enter into some other discourse, for then 
indeed you would be like them. Surely Allah will gather together 
the hypocrites and the disbelievers all in hell — 141 those who wait 
(for misfortunes) for you. Then if you have a victory from Allah 
they say: Were we not with you? And if there is a chance for the 
disbelievers, they say: Did we not prevail over you and defend you 
from the believers? So Allah will judge between you on the day of 
Resurrection. And Allah will by no means give the disbelievers a 
way against the believers. 

Section 21 : End of the Hypocrites 

142 The hypocrites seek to deceive Allah, and He will pay 
them back their deceit. And when they stand up for prayer, they 
stand up sluggishly — they do it only to be seen by people and 



a (137) Allah's not guiding them is the consequence of their own actions. 
They wavered first but in the end became firm in disbelief. 

b (140) See 6:68 which was revealed at Makkah. Muslims are told to leave 
the assembly where truth is derided. Criticism is quite a different thing and a 
Muslim should always be ready to meet any criticism of his religion. (Editor 's 
Note: Thus the response when faced with mere ridicule of Islam is to withdraw, 
temporarily, from that company of people and rejoin them later when they stop 
their mocking. It is therefore entirely wrong to believe that Muslims are required 
to attack physically, still less kill, those who deride their religion.) 



132 4. WOMEN • 4 : 143 

they remember Allah but little, 143 wavering between that (and this) 
— (belonging) neither to these nor to those." And whomsoever 
Allah leaves in error, you will not find a way for him. 144 you 
who believe, do not take the disbelievers for friends instead of the 
believers. Do you desire to give Allah a manifest proof against 
yourselves? 145 The hypocrites are surely in the lowest depths of 
the Fire, and you will find no helper for them, 146 except those who 
repent and amend and hold fast to Allah and are sincere in their 
obedience to Allah — these are with the believers. And Allah will 
soon grant the believers a mighty reward. 147 Why should Allah 
punish you if you are grateful and believe? And Allah is ever 
Multiplier of rewards, Knowing.

148 Allah does not love the public utterance of hurtful speech, 
«■ except by one who has been wronged. c And Allah is ever Hearing, 
Knowing. 149 If you do good openly or keep it secret or pardon an 
evil, Allah surely is ever Pardoning, Powerful. 

150 Those who disbelieve in Allah and His messengers and 
desire to make a distinction between Allah and His messengers 
and say: We believe in some and disbelieve in others; and desire 
to take a course in between — 151 these are truly disbelievers; and 
We have prepared for the disbelievers a humiliating punishment. 
152 And those who believe in Allah and His messengers and make 
no distinction between any of them, to them He will grant their 
rewards. And Allah is ever Forgiving, Merciful. 6 



a (143) The reference in "that and this" is to belief and disbelief. 

b (147) The word shakir, usually meaning thankful, when used as an attri- 
bute of the Divine Being signifies One Who multiplies rewards to His servants. 

c (148) The use of defamatory speech of every kind regarding others is stric- 
tly forbidden, but justification for it may exist in case a person has in some way 
been wronged. 

rf(149) If you pardon the evil which anyone has done to you, Allah will 
pardon your evils, and grant you even good reward; He is not only Pardoning, but 
also Powerful to grant good reward. 

e (152) To make distinction between Allah and His messengers means to 
believe in one and not in the other. Islam requires the acceptance of all prophets 
who were raised for the regeneration of mankind, and hence a denial of any one of 



4:153' TRANSGRESSIONS OF THE JEWS 133 

Section 22: Transgressions of the Jews 

153 The People of the Book ask you to bring down to them a 
Book from heaven; indeed they demanded of Moses a greater thing 
than that, for they said: Show us Allah manifestly. So destructive 
punishment overtook them on account of their wrongdoing. Then 
they took the calf (for a god), after clear signs had come to them, 
but We pardoned this. And We gave Moses clear authority. 154 And 
We raised the mountain above them at their covenant. And We 
said to them: Enter the gate submissively. And We said to them: 
Do not violate the Sabbath; and We took from them a firm 
covenant. 

155 Then for their breaking their covenant and their disbelief 
in the messages of Allah and their killing the prophets unjustly 
and their saying, Our hearts are securely covered; no, Allah has 
sealed them on account of their disbelief, so they do not believe 
but a little; " 156 and for their disbelief and for their uttering against 
Mary a grievous slander; 157 and for their saying: We have killed 
the Messiah, Jesus, son of Mary, the messenger of Allah, and they 
did not kill him, nor did they cause his death on the cross, c but he 

the prophets named in the Quran takes a person out of the category of believers 
and places him among the disbelievers. 

a (155) The incidents referred to in verses 153-155 have been mentioned in 
detail in 2:51-71; see the footnotes there. 

b (156) The slander referred to was that Mary was guilty of fornication. 

c (157-1) The words used here do not negative that Jesus was nailed to the 
cross; they negative his having expired on the cross as a result of being nailed to 
it. That Jesus died a natural death is plainly stated in 5:117. The Gospels contain 
clear testimony showing that Jesus Christ escaped death on the cross. For example, 
Jesus remained on the cross for a few hours only (Mark 15:25, John 19:14) but 
death by crucifixion was always slow. When the side of Jesus was pierced, blood 
rushed out and this was a certain sign of life (John 19:34). Jesus was not buried 
but was given into the charge of a wealthy disciple of his, who lavished care on 
him and put him in a spacious tomb hewn in the side of a rock (Mark 15:46). 
When the tomb was seen on the third day, the stone was found to have been 
removed from its mouth (Mark 16:4), which would not have been the case if there 
had been a supernatural rising. Jesus Christ prayed the whole night before his 
arrest to be saved from the accursed death on the cross, and he also asked his 
disciples to pray for him. He seems to have even received a promise from God to 



134 4. WOMEN • 4 : 158 

was made to appear to them as such." And certainly those who 
differ concerning it are in doubt about it. They have no knowledge 
about it, but only follow a conjecture, and they did not kill him for 
certain; 158 rather, Allah exalted him in His presence. And Allah is 
ever Mighty, Wise. 159 And there is none of the People of the Book 
but will believe in this before his death; and on the day of 
Resurrection he will be a witness against them. c 

160 So for the wrongdoing of the Jews, We forbade them the 
good things which had been made lawful for them, and for their 
hindering many (people) from Allah's way. 161 And for their taking 
usury — though indeed they were forbidden it — and their 
devouring the property of people falsely. And We have prepared 
for the disbelievers from among them a painful punishment. 162 But 
the firm in knowledge among them and the believers believe in 

be saved, and it was to this promise that he referred when he cried out on the 
cross: "My God, my God, why have You forsaken me?" The statements made in 
the Quran corroborate the testimony found in the Gospels. Jesus did not die on the 
cross, nor was he killed as were the two thieves who were crucified with him, but 
to people he appeared as if he were dead. 

a (157-2) These words may bear two interpretations: he was made to be like 
it to them or the matter was made dubious to them. The story that someone else 
was made to resemble Jesus is not borne out by the words of the Quran, which 
could only mean, if an object were mentioned, that Jesus was made to resemble 
someone, not that someone was made to resemble Jesus. 

b (158) For "exaltation" see 3:55 footnote 2. Being exalted in the Divine 
presence was opposed to being killed on the cross. Deuteronomy 21:23 explains 
this, for there we have, he who is hanged is accursed of God. If Jesus had died on 
the cross he would have been accursed; hence the statement made here — he was 
not killed on the cross and accursed but he was exalted in the Divine presence. 

c (159) Both Jews and Christians necessarily believe in the death of Jesus on 
the cross, while according to the Quran they have really no sure knowledge of it. 
The belief of the Jews is that since Jesus died on the cross he was accursed of 
God, and hence he cannot be a prophet. Following quite a different line of argu- 
ment, Christians believe that Jesus died on the cross and was accursed, but that 
unless Jesus were accursed he could not take away the sins of those that believe in 
him. Hence the belief of both Jews and Christians is that Jesus died on the cross, 
and the meaning of the verse is clear, i.e., every Jew and Christian, despite having 
no sure knowledge at all, must believe before his death that Jesus died on the 
cross.

what has been revealed to you and what was revealed before you, 
and those who keep up prayer and give the due charity and the 
believers in Allah and the Last Day — these it is to whom We 
shall give a mighty reward. 

Section 23: Previous Revelation and the Quran 

163 Surely We have revealed to you as We revealed to Noah 
and the prophets after him, and We revealed to Abraham and 
Ishmael and Isaac and Jacob and the tribes, and Jesus and Job and 
Jonah and Aaron and Solomon, and We gave to David a scripture. 
164 And (We sent) messengers We have mentioned to you before 
and messengers We have not mentioned to you. And to Moses 
Allah addressed His word, speaking (to him) — 165 messengers, 
bearers of good news " and warners, so that the people may have 
no plea against Allah after the (coming of) messengers. And Allah 
is ever Mighty, Wise. 166 But Allah bears witness by what He has 
revealed to you that He has revealed it with His knowledge, and 
the angels (also) bear witness. And Allah is sufficient as a witness. 

167 Those who disbelieve and hinder (others) from Allah's 
way, they indeed have gone astray, straying far. 168 Those who dis- 
believe and act unjustly, Allah will never forgive them, nor guide 
them to a path, 169 except the path of hell, to abide in it for a long 
time. And that is easy to Allah. 

	170 O mankind, the Messenger has indeed come to you with 
truth from your Lord, so believe, it is better for you. And if you 
disbelieve, then surely to Allah belongs whatever is in the heavens 
and the earth. And Allah is ever Knowing, Wise. 171 People of 
the Book, do not exaggerate in the matter of your religion nor 
speak anything about Allah but the truth. The Messiah, Jesus, son 
of Mary, is only a messenger of Allah and His word* which He 



a (165) The good news which these messengers brought relates as much to 
the peace and happiness which is granted to the righteous as to the advent of one 
who, coming at the end, should unite the qualifications of all the prophets in his 
own person, and accordingly make the nations of the earth as one nation. 

b (171-1) Kalima, or word, is here equivalent to prophecy, in which sense it

communicated to Mary and a mercy from Him. a So believe in 
Allah and His messengers. And do not say, Three. Refrain (from 
it), it is better for you. Allah is only one God. Far be it from His 
glory to have a son. To Him belongs whatever is in the heavens 
and whatever is in the earth. And sufficient is Allah as having 
charge of affairs. 

Section 24: Prophethood of Jesus 

172 The Messiah does not disdain to be a servant of Allah, 
nor do the angels who are near to Him. And whoever disdains His 
service and is proud, He will gather them all together to Himself. 
173 Then as for those who believe and do good, He will pay them 
fully their rewards and give them more out of His grace. And as 
for those who disdain and are proud, He will punish them with a 
painful punishment, and they will find for themselves besides Allah 
no friend nor helper. 

174 O people, manifest proof has indeed come to you from 
your Lord and We have sent down to you a clear light. 17S Then as 
for those who believe in Allah and hold fast by Him, He will admit 
them to His mercy and grace, and guide them to Himself on a right 
path.

is frequently used in the Quran. Jesus is called a prophecy because he was born in 
accordance with a prophecy from God. 

a (171-2) Ruh also means mercy, as translated here. It also signifies inspira- 
tion or Divine revelation, and if this significance is adopted it would be an expla- 
nation of the foregoing words, i.e. His prophecy which He communicated to Mary. 
Even if we take spirit to be the meaning of the word ruh, it does not take Jesus 
beyond the limits of mortality, because according to the Quran the spirit of God is 
breathed into every human being (32:9). Moreover, the words used here can only 
mean a spirit from Him and not the spirit from Him. 

b (171-3) The doctrine of Trinity is plainly rejected here. There are not three 
persons in Godhead, but only one: Allah is only one God. The Quran nowhere 
says that the Christian Trinity is formed of Jesus, Mary, and God, although it no 
doubt refers to the Roman Catholic doctrine of the worship of Mary in 5:1 16. 



4 : 176 • PROPHETHOOD OF JESUS 137 

If a man dies (and) he has no son and he has a sister, hers is half of 
what he leaves, and he shall be her heir if she has no son. But if 
there are two (sisters), they shall have two-thirds of what he leaves. 
And if there are (both) brothers and sisters, then for the male is the 
like of the portion of two females. Allah makes clear to you, in 
case you go astray. And Allah is Knower of all things." 



a (176) The rule given here supplements the law of inheritance as given at 
the commencement of this chapter. Here there are neither children nor parents and 
therefore the whole of the inheritance goes to the brothers and the sisters. Rever- 
sion to the law of inheritance just after speaking of Jesus has perhaps a deeper 
meaning. It is a fact that no prophet appeared among the Israelites after Jesus, and 
therefore his death really left Israel without a spiritual head who should rise to the 
eminence of prophethood. The spiritual kingdom which was promised to 
Abraham, and which hitherto remained in the house of Israel, was now taken from 
the Israelites and made over to the brother nation, the Ishmaelites. This would 
also explain the words addressed to Moses: "The Lord your God will raise up for 
you a Prophet like me from your midst, from your brethren" (Deuteronomy, 
18:15). 



Chapter 5 

Al-Ma'idah Food 

The name of this chapter refers to the demand for food, or physical sus- 
tenance, by the followers of Jesus and the granting of Jesus' prayer for his 
earlier and later followers (verses 1 12-1 15). Not only physical food, but God 
sent down for them spiritual food in the form of the Quran, which "perfected" 
religion (v. 3). The chapter deals with the deviation of the Jews and Chris- 
tians from the truth and their hostility towards Islam. It contains directions 
for Muslims on several points and warns them to avoid the errors into which 
previous nations fell. It ends with a refutation of the doctrine of Jesus' divinity 
and gives hope of the deliverance of his followers from this wrong belief. 
This chapter was mainly revealed in 5-7 A.H. However, v. 3, speaking of the 
perfection of religion in Islam, was revealed during the Holy Prophet's last 
pilgrimage to Makkah in 10 A.H. 



Section 1 : Perfection of Religion in Islam

Thus respect for law, religious as well as temporal, is taught here.

and that killed by a fall, and that killed by goring with the horn, 
and what wild beasts have eaten — except what you slaughter; 
and what is sacrificed on stones set up (for idols), 8 and (it is for- 
bidden) that you seek to divide by arrows; that is a transgression. 
This day have those who disbelieve despaired of your religion, so

a (2-2) Hady or "offering" means what is driven (to Makkah). Qald'id or 
"victims with garlands" means necklaces or what is put upon the neck of an ani- 
mal that is brought as an offering to Makkah for sacrifice. Only camels are made 
to wear garlands, while hady includes all kinds of animals brought as offering. 

b (2-3) The principle laid down here requires from Muslims equal treatment 
for all nations, for those whom we hate as well as for those whom we love. Only 
this principle of Islam can serve as the basis for an international code for the 
modern world and an international law. 

c (2-4) Editor 's Note: Muslims ought only to cooperate with one another in 
matters of goodness, and are forbidden to help each other in wrongdoing against 
others. This injunction prohibits the evils of blind patriotism and unconditional 
support for one's own people even when they commit injustices against others. 

d (3-1) The meaning is that if an animal partly eaten by wild beasts is found 
while yet alive, and is slaughtered in the proper manner, its flesh is allowed. 

e (3-2) Certain stones were set up around the Ka'bah, over or near which it 
was customary for the idolaters to kill animals as offerings to certain idols. 

/(3-3) This prohibits dividing the flesh of slaughtered animals by means of 
certain arrows with which the idolatrous Arabs played a game of chance.

things are allowed to you, and what you have taught the beasts 
and birds of prey, training them to hunt — you teach them of what 
Allah has taught you; so eat of what they catch for you and 
mention the name of Allah over it; and keep your duty to Allah. 
Surely Allah is Swift in reckoning. 5 This day (all) good things are 
made lawful for you. And the food of those who have been given 
the Book is lawful for you and your food is lawful for them. c And

fornicating nor taking them for lovers in secret. And whoever 



a (3-4) This verse was revealed towards the close of the Holy Prophet's life, 
and it is held by all authorities that no precept was revealed after this. It is a clear 
testimony to the perfection of religion in Islam, no such claim being made by any 
other book or religion. Just before the Holy Prophet Muhammad, Jesus had said: 
"I still have many things to say to you, but you cannot bear them now. However, 
when he, the Spirit of truth, has come, he will guide you into all truth" (John, 
16:12-13). The Prophet Muhammad was thus the last of the prophets, because 
religion being perfected, no prophet was needed after him. 

b (4) Game killed by means of beasts and birds of prey taught to hunt is 
allowed. When the beast or the bird is sent after the prey, the name of Allah 
should be mentioned. Game killed by an arrow or by a shot is allowed, subject to 
the same condition. If the game is not killed before it falls into the hands of the 
hunter, it should be slaughtered; if it is already killed, it is lawful in that condition. 

c (5-1) Thus animals slaughtered by the Jews or the Christians are allowed 
when slaughtered in the name of God. However, any food which is clearly prohi- 
bited cannot become lawful because it is offered by a Jew or a Christian. 

d (5-2) In Islam intermarriages with idol-worshippers are totally prohibited 
(2:221), but in the case of a people whose religion is based on a revealed book, in 
which category fall almost all the nations of the world, the taking of their women 
in marriage is expressly allowed. The giving away of Muslim women in marriage 
to followers of other religions is not, however, expressly mentioned, and practice 
from the earliest times is against it. {Editor 's Note: A Jewish or Christian woman 
marrying a Muslim man would enter a household where her prophets and scrip- 
tures are believed in; while in the converse case a Muslim woman would be 
entering a household where the Prophet Muhammad and the Quran are not

Section 2: Duty of Uprightness 

6 O you who believe, when you rise up for prayer, wash your 
faces, and your hands up to the elbows, and wipe your heads, and 
(wash) your feet up to the ankles. And if you are under an obliga- 
tion," then wash (your body). And if you are sick, or on a journey, 
or one of you has come from the toilet, or you have had (sexual) 
contact with women, and you cannot find water, then resort to pure 
earth and wipe your faces and your hands with it. Allah does not 
desire to place a burden on you but He wishes to purify you, and 
that He may complete His favour on you, so that you may give 
thanks. 

7 And remember Allah's favour on you and His covenant with 
which He bound you when you said: We have heard and we obey. 
And keep your duty to Allah. Surely Allah is Knower of what is in 
the hearts. 

8 O you who believe, be upright for Allah, bearers of witness 
with justice; and do not let hatred of a people incite you not to act 
equitably. Be just; that is nearer to observance of duty. And keep 
your duty to Allah. Surely Allah is Aware of what you do. 9 AUah 
has promised to those who believe and do good deeds: For them is 
forgiveness and a mighty reward. 10 And those who disbelieve and 
reject Our messages, such are the companions of the flaming fire.

Section 3: Christian Violation of the Covenant 

12 And certainly Allah made a covenant with the Children of 
Israel, and We raised up among them twelve chieftains." And Allah 
said: Surely I am with you. If you keep up prayer and give the due 
charity and believe in My messengers and assist them and offer to 
Allah a goodly gift, I will certainly cover your evil deeds, and 
make you enter Gardens in which rivers flow. But whoever among 
you disbelieves after that, he indeed strays from the right way. 
13 But on account of their breaking their covenant We cursed them 
and hardened their hearts. They alter words from their places and 
neglect a portion of what they were reminded of. And you will 
always discover treachery in them excepting a few of them — so 
pardon them and forgive. Surely Allah loves those who do good 
(to others). 14 And with those who say, We are Christians, We 
made a covenant, but they neglected a portion of what they were 
reminded of, so We stirred up enmity and hatred among them to 
the day of Resurrection/ And Allah will soon inform them of what 
they did. 

15 O People of the Book, indeed Our Messenger has come to 
you, making clear to you much of what you concealed of the Book 
and passing over much. Indeed, there has come to you from Allah, 



a (12) See the Bible, Book of Numbers, 1:5-16 and 1:44. 

b (14-1) The covenant, made through Jesus, was to accept the Prophet when 
he appeared. Jesus told his followers: "I still have many things to say to you, but 
you cannot bear them now. However, when he, the Spirit of truth, has come, he 
will guide you into all truth; for he will not speak on his own authority, but what- 
ever he hears he will speak" (John 16:12-13). 

c (14-2) The prophecy that there shall always be hatred and enmity between 
the various Christian peoples has proved true in all ages, and never more clearly 
than in modern times with the World Wars in Europe. 

d (15-1) There were many truths which the Jews and the Christians had lost, 
their scriptures not having remained free from corruption, and many which were 
in their books but which they did not act upon. Those which were of permanent 
value were revealed in the Quran, but others — referred to in passing over much 
— that only suited the requirements of the earlier times were not now needed.

a Light and a clear Book," 16 by which Allah guides such as follow 
His pleasure into the ways of peace, and brings them out of dark- 
ness into light by His will, and guides them to the right path. 

17 They indeed disbelieve who say: Surely, Allah — He is the 
Messiah, son of Mary. Say: Who then could control anything as 
against Allah when He wished to destroy the Messiah, son of 
Mary, and his mother and all those on the earth? And Allah's is 
the kingdom of the heavens and the earth and all that is between 
them. He creates what He pleases. And Allah is Powerful over all 
things. 

18 And the Jews and the Christians say: We are the sons of 
Allah and His beloved ones. c Say: Why does He then punish you 
for your sins? Rather, you are mortals from among those whom 
He has created. He forgives whom He pleases and punishes whom 
He pleases.'' And Allah's is the kingdom of the heavens and the 
earth and all that is between them, and to Him is the eventual 
coming. 19 People of the Book, indeed Our Messenger has come 
to you explaining to you after a cessation of the messengers, 6 in 
case you say: No bearer of good news came to us nor a warner. So 
indeed a bearer of good news and a warner has come to you. And 
Allah is Powerful over all things. 



a (15-2) The Light is the Holy Prophet, and the Book, the Quran. 

b (17) The meaning is that Jesus and Mary, and all those who were then on 
the earth, tasted equally of death; hence Jesus was a mortal and not God. 

c (18-1) In the Gospels it is said: "Blessed are the peacemakers, for they 
shall be called the children of God" (Matthew, 5:9). The Christians think they are 
the people spoken of here. The Jews considered themselves as the favourite nation, 
because they thought they were the only nation chosen by God for the gift of 
Divine revelation, to the exclusion of all other nations of the world. 

d (18-2) It is in accordance with Divine laws that forgiveness and punish- 
ment are exercised, and the alleged atonement of Jesus brought no change in this. 

e (19) Several centuries had elapsed since the appearance of any prophet in 
any country when the great Arabian Prophet made his appearance. No nation in 
the world claims the appearance of any messenger in it between the advent of 
Jesus Christ and that of the Holy Prophet Muhammad. The world was, as it were, 
preparing itself for the advent of the greatest of all prophets, who was to be a 
messenger to all the nations of the world.

Section 4: Israelites' Violation of the Covenant 

20 And when Moses said to his people: My people, remember 
the favour of Allah to you when He raised prophets among you 
and made you kings and gave you what He did not give to any 
other of the nations." 21 My people, enter the Holy Land which 
Allah has ordained for you and do not turn your backs, for then you 
will turn back losers. 22 They said: Moses, in it are a powerful 
people, and we shall not enter it until they go out from it; if they 
go out from it, then surely we will enter. 23 Two men of those who 
feared, on whom Allah had bestowed a favour, said: Enter upon 
them by the gate, for when you enter it you will surely be victo- 
rious; and put your trust in Allah, if you are believers. ' 24 They 
said: Moses, we will never enter it so long as they are in it; go 
therefore you and your Lord, and fight; surely here we sit. 25 He 
said: My Lord, I have control of none but my own self and my 
brother; so distinguish between us and the transgressing people. 
26 He said: It will surely be forbidden to them for forty years — 
they will wander about in the land. e So do not grieve for the trans- 
gressing people.

27 And relate to them with truth the story of the two sons of 
Adam, when they offered an offering, but it was accepted from 
one of them and was not accepted from the other. He said: I will 
certainly kill you. (The other) said: Allah accepts only from the 
dutiful. 28 If you stretch out your hand against me to kill me I shall 



a (20) The reference need not be to the earlier history of the Israelites, but to 
their history as dating from the time of Moses, for the advent of Moses had 
brought about an entire change both in their spiritual and political status. 

b (23) These were Joshua and Caleb. See Numbers, 14:6-9. 

c (26) See Numbers 14:23. The forty years spoken of here represent the life 
of that generation. 

d (27) The reference is apparently to the story of Cain and Abel. Compare 
Genesis 4:3-12. But the story may be taken allegorically, where the Israelites may 
be taken for the aggressive and sinful brother and the Ishmaelites, as represented 
by the Holy Prophet, for the righteous one.

not stretch out my hand against you to kill you. Surely I fear 
Allah, the Lord of the worlds: 29 I would rather that you should 
bear the sin against me and your own sin, a thus you would be one 
of the companions of the Fire; and that is the recompense of the 
unjust. 30 At length his mind made it easy for him to kill his 
brother, so he killed him; then he became one of the losers. 31 Then 
Allah sent a crow scratching the ground to show him how to cover 
the dead body of his brother. He said: Woe is me! Am I not able to 
be as this crow and cover the dead body of my brother? So he 
became regretful. 

32 For this reason We prescribed for the Children of Israel 
that whoever kills a person, unless it is for manslaughter or for 
mischief in the land, it is as though he had killed all mankind. 
And whoever saves a life, it is as though he had saved the lives of 
all mankind. And certainly Our messengers came to them with clear 
arguments, but even after that many of them commit excesses in 
the land. 33 The only punishment of those who wage war against 
Allah and His Messenger and strive to make mischief in the land c 
is that they should be murdered, or crucified, or their hands and 
their feet should be cut off on opposite sides, or they should be 



a (29) The words "the sin against me" are literally "my sin" but here mean 
the sin committed against me, i.e. the sin of murder. By "your sin" is meant his 
previous sin on account of which his offering was not accepted. The righteous 
brother tells the wicked one that even after knowing that he intended to kill him 
he would not be the first to raise his hand against him and kill him, but he would 
rather that the guilty one should go on adding to his sins. 

b (32) The reference is generally understood to be to the gravity of the crime 
of murder. 

c (33-1) This has generally been accepted as referring to armed robbers and 
murderers who cause disorder and loss of life and property in a settled state of 
society, and not to those who actually wage war. The punishment to be inflicted in 
any particular case would depend upon the circumstances of the case, as well as 
the time and place where the crime was committed. (Editor 's Note: Some recent 
commentators suggest that these words do not convey commands to apply these 
punishments as legal penalties, but describe the natural consequences that occur in 
society as a result of the actions of the perpetrators of such crimes.)

the Hereafter they shall have a grievous punishment, 34 except those 
who repent before you overpower them; so know that Allah is 
Forgiving, Merciful. 

Section 6: Punishment of Offenders 

35 O you who believe, keep your duty to Allah, and seek 
means of nearness to Him, and strive hard in His way that you may 
be successful. 36 Those who disbelieve, even if they had all that is 
in the earth, and as much as it again, to ransom themselves with it 
from the punishment of the day of Resurrection, it would not be 
accepted from them; and theirs is a painful punishment. 37 They 
would desire to come forth from the Fire, and they will not come 
forth from it, and theirs is a lasting punishment. 

38 And (as for) the man and the woman addicted to theft, cut 
off their hands as a penalty for what they have earned — an 
exemplary punishment from Allah. And Allah is Mighty, Wise. 
39 But whoever repents after his wrongdoing and reforms, Allah 
will turn to him (mercifully). Surely Allah is Forgiving, Merciful. 
40 Do you not know that Allah is He to Whom belongs the king- 
dom of the heavens and the earth? He punishes whom He pleases, 



a (33-2) These words literally mean they should he banished from the earth, 
but are mostly accepted as meaning imprisonment. Deportation is also included if 
we take "earth" as meaning a particular country. 

b (38) The cutting off of hands may be taken metaphorically or literally. If 
taken metaphorically, it would simply mean restraining the thief by imprisonment 
or otherwise. If taken literally, it must be emphasized that it is the maximum 
punishment, and whether it is inflicted would depend on the circumstances of the 
case. This punishment is called exemplary, and exemplary punishment could only 
be inflicted where the crime is very serious or the offender is a habitual criminal. 
The next verse shows that the punishment of cutting off the hand is only for a 
criminal who does not reform, i.e. for the habitual offender. Moreover, what is 
required is repentance and reform. To give a man a chance to reform it is 
necessary that he should be given freedom of action before the more serious 
punishment is inflicted. I translate the word al-sariq as meaning one addicted to 
theft, not only for the reasons given above but also because an explanatory read- 
ing of this word is al-sarriq, which is a noun of intensiveness, from the same root.

41 O Messenger, do not let those grieve you who hasten to 
disbelief, from among those who say with their mouths, We 
believe, and their hearts do not believe, and from among those 
who are Jews — they are listeners for the sake of a lie, listeners 
for another people who have not come to you." They alter words 
after they are put in their (proper) places, saying: If you are given 
this, take it, and if you are not given this, be cautious. And he for 
whom Allah intends temptation, you control nothing for him 
against Allah. Those are they whose hearts Allah does not intend 
to purify. For them is disgrace in this world, and for them a 
grievous punishment in the Hereafter. 42 Listeners for the sake of a 
lie, devourers of forbidden things, so if they come to you, judge 
between them or turn away from them. And if you turn away from 
them, they cannot harm you at all. And if you judge, judge 
between them with equity. Surely Allah loves the equitable. 
43 And how do they make you a judge and they have the Torah in 
which is Allah's judgment? Yet they turn away after that! And 
these are not believers. 

Section 7: The Quran and Previous Scriptures 

44 Surely We revealed the Torah, having guidance and light. e 



a (41) The meaning is that they listen, but their object is only to invent lies 
and to give false reports to people who have not come to the Holy Prophet. 

b (42) By the agreement drawn up between the various nationalities of 
Madinah on the advent of the Holy Prophet there (see 2:84 footnote), all disputes 
were to be referred to the Holy Prophet, but the Jews had by this time become so 
inimical to the Prophet that he is allowed to refuse to judge between them. In case 
he judged between them, he is still told to judge with equity. To be equitable, 
despite their severe enmity, shows that the Prophet had reached the highest point 
of moral rectitude to which man can attain. 

c (44-1) Verses 44-47 do not provide evidence of the purity of the text of the 
Bible as we have it. That the Torah was a Divine revelation containing light and 
guidance has never been denied. What is denied is that that light and guidance 
were kept intact throughout the ages. It is further denied that these two books 
were meant for the whole world and for all ages.

By it did the prophets who submitted themselves (to Allah) judge 
for the Jews, and the rabbis and the doctors of law, because they 
were required to guard the Book of Allah," and they were wit- 
nesses of it. So do not fear the people and fear Me, and do not take 
a small price for My messages. And whoever does not judge by 
what Allah has revealed, those are the disbelievers. 45 And We 
prescribed to them in it that life is for life, and eye for eye, and 
nose for nose, and ear for ear, and tooth for tooth, and for wounds 
retaliation. But whoever forgoes it, it shall be an expiation for him. c 
And whoever does not judge by what Allah has revealed, those are 
the wrongdoers. 

46 And We sent after them in their footsteps Jesus, son of 
Mary, verifying what was (already) before him of the Torah; and 
We gave him the Gospel containing guidance and light, and 
verifying what was before it of the Torah, and a guidance and an 
admonition for the dutiful. 47 And let the People of the Gospel judge 
by what Allah has revealed in it. And whoever does not judge by 
what Allah has revealed, those are the transgressors. 



a (44-2) They were required to guard the Book of God but nonetheless 
alterations were made in it as stated in 2:75 and 2:79. 

b (44-3) By judging is not meant only the judging of civil or criminal cases, 
but judging in all matters of religion, so that those who did not judge the revela- 
tion of the Holy Prophet by what was revealed in the Torah were disbelievers. 
The adoption of the words what Allah has revealed instead of the Torah is signifi- 
cant. It shows that the whole of the Torah as existing then was not looked upon by 
the Quran as being the Divine revelation. 

c (45) If a man forgoes his right to an act of reprisal against his brother, this 
shall be an expiation for any wrong he may have done. 

d (46) The description of the Gospel as containing light and guidance 
conveys the same significance as the similar statement regarding the Torah in v. 
44. In addition it is stated that the Gospel verified the Torah despite the fact that it 
introduces many new doctrines in place of those given in the Mosaic law. This 
clearly shows that by verification is meant only corroboration of the general prin- 
ciples and broad doctrines of the faith, such as the unity of God and equitable 
dealing with people, or the declaration by one prophet of the truth of a previous 
prophet, as the declaration of the truth of Moses by Jesus and of both by the Holy 
Prophet. It is in this sense that the Quran is spoken of as verifying the Torah and 
the Gospel.

48 And We have revealed to you the Book with the truth, 
verifying what is (already) before it of the Book and a guardian 
over it," so judge between them by what Allah has revealed, and 
do not follow their low desires, (turning away) from the truth that 
has come to you. For everyone of you We appointed a law and a 
way. And if Allah had pleased He would have made you a single 
people, but that He might try you in what He gave you. e So vie 
with one another in good works. To Allah you will all return, so 
He will inform you of that in which you differed; 49 and that you 
should judge between them by what Allah has revealed, and do 
not follow their low desires, and be cautious of them that they do 
not seduce you from part of what Allah has revealed to you. Then 
if they turn away, know that Allah desires to afflict them for some 
of their sins. And surely many of the people are transgressors. 50 Is 
it then the judgment of ignorance that they desire? And who is 
better than Allah to judge for a people who are sure? 



a (48-1) Being a guardian over all previous revelation shows that whatever 
was of permanent value in the previous scriptures has been preserved in the Quran. 
The previous books contained a light and guidance for the people for whom they 
were meant, and they were commanded to judge by those books, but the Quran is 
now the Book which judges all truth, wherever it may have been. 

b (48-2) The appointment of a law and a way for everyone refers to the 
giving of different laws to different nations in accordance with their requirements 
before the revelation of the Quran, which fulfilled the requirements of all nations 
and all ages. Thus the Quran here recognizes the principle to which it refers fre- 
quently, that prophets were raised among every people, for which see particularly 
10:47, 13:7 and 35:24. 

c (48-3) One significance is that man is placed above the whole of creation 
in that he has been granted discretionary powers. Hence, people follow different 
ways, adopting different sects. If man had not been granted these powers, all 
humans would have been a single people, but then man's better qualities would 
not have been manifested. The words may, however, also mean "if Allah pleases 
He will make you a single people", referring to the ultimate destiny of the human 
race. In fact all people are now growing to the consciousness that they are all but 
one nation. (Editor's Note: These words, along with what follows in this verse, 
also indicate that all religions, though they are different, set before their adherents 
the same goal of doing good works, and therefore the followers of each religion 
should try to excel followers of other religions, or vie with them, in the doing of 
good works. That is how God tries adherents of every religion in this life.)

Section 8: Relations of Muslims with Enemies 

51 O you who believe, do not take the Jews and the Christians 
for friends. They are friends of each other. And whoever among 
you takes them for friends he is indeed one of them. Surely Allah 
does not guide the unjust people." 52 But you see those in whose 
hearts is a disease, hastening towards them, saying: We fear that a 
calamity may befall us.* Maybe Allah will bring the victory or a 
commandment from Himself/ so they will regret what they hid in 
their souls. 53 And those who believe will say: Are these they who 
swore by Allah with their most forcible oaths that they were 
surely with you? Their deeds will be fruitless, so they will be 
losers. 

54 O you who believe, if anyone of you should turn back 
from his religion, then Allah will bring a people whom He loves 
and who love Him, humble towards the believers, mighty against 
the disbelievers, striving hard in Allah's way and not fearing the 
censure of any censurer. This is Allah's grace — He gives it 
to whom He pleases. And Allah is Ample-giving, Knowing. 



a (51) All non-believers, whatever their own differences, had made common 
cause against Islam; this is what is meant by their being friends of each other. 
Muslims are warned that they should not expect help or friendship from any party 
of them, whether Jews, Christians, or idolaters. It would have been weakness of 
faith in the ultimate triumph of Islam if, from fear of a powerful enemy, they had 
sought help and friendship here and there among a hostile people, as the next 
verse shows. See 60:7-9 which make it clear that the prohibition against friendly 
relations with the disbelievers was only temporary, to be operative only so long as 
the war continued. Those verses settle conclusively that friendly relations between 
Muslims and non-Muslims, as such, are not prohibited. 

b (52-1) By hastening towards them is meant hastening to make friendship 
with them or seeking their help, fearing a Muslim reverse. 

c (52-2) Bringing about a commandment refers to the establishment of the 
rule of Islam, by which is meant the dominance of Islam, there being a further 
reference to the spiritual conquests of Islam in v. 54. 

d (54) Muslims were severely persecuted while at Makkah and their troubles 
at Madinah increased manifold owing to the presence of warring tribes on all 
sides. Yet they faced all these hardships with the greatest perseverance, and cases 
of apostasy were rare.

Section 9: Those who mock 

57 O you who believe, do not take for friends those who take 
your religion as a mockery and a sport, from among those who 
were given the Book before you and the disbelievers; and keep 
your duty to Allah if you are believers." 58 And when you call to 
prayer they take it as a mockery and a sport. That is because they 
are a people who do not understand. 

59 Say: O People of the Book, do you find fault with us for 
only that we believe in Allah and in what has been revealed to us 
and what was revealed before, while most of you are trans- 
gressors? 60 Say: Shall I inform you of those worse than this in 
retribution from Allah? They are those whom Allah has cursed 
and upon whom He brought His wrath and of whom He made apes 
and swine, and who serve the devil. These are in a worse plight 
and further astray from the straight path. 61 And when they come to 
you, they say, We believe, and surely they come in unbelief and 
they go forth in it. And Allah knows best what they conceal. 
62 And you see many of them hastening to (commit) sin and trans- 
gression, and their devouring unlawful gain. Certainly evil is what 
they do. 63 Why do not the rabbis and the doctors of law prohibit 
them from their sinful utterances and their devouring unlawful 
gain? Certainly evil are the works they do. 



a (57) Muslims were prohibited from having friendly relations with those 
who mocked their religion and their Prophet. Friendship with such people would 
indeed have led to a similar bent of mind. (Editor 's Note: This again makes clear 
that friendship is only disallowed with disbelievers when they behave in a hostile 
way towards Islam. Muslims are nowhere required to attack physically or punish 
those who mock their religion, but only withdraw friendship temporarily.) 

b (63) Editor's Note: It is for their committing of evil deeds, the sins prohibi- 
ted in their own scriptures, that the Jews are here condemned. Verses 65 and 66

64 And the Jews say: The hand of Allah is tied up. Their own 
hands are fettered and they are cursed for what they say. No, both 
His hands are spread out." He disburses as He pleases. And what 
has been revealed to you from jour Lord will certainly make many 
of them increase in inordinacy and disbelief. And We have cast 
among them enmity and hatred till the day of Resurrection. 
Whenever they kindle a fire for war Allah puts it out, and they 
strive to make mischief in the land. And Allah does not love the 
mischief-makers. 65 And if the People of the Book had believed 
and kept their duty We would certainly have removed from them 
their evils, and made them enter gardens of bliss. 66 And if they had 
observed the Torah and the Gospel and what is revealed to them 
from their Lord, they would certainly have eaten from above them 
and from beneath their feet. Some of them keep to the moderate 
course; but most of them — evil is what they do. e 



make it clear that Jews and Christians should not have violated the good teachings 
of their own scriptures and that there were some of them who did not. 

a (64-1) Muslims as a community were mostly poor people who accepted 
the truth. Jews on the other hand carried on business and were rich, hence they 
taunted Muslims, saying that Allah's hand was fettered. See also 3:181. The words 
"both His hands are spread out" indicate that God will enrich Muslims materially 
as well as spiritually. 

b (64-2) The casting of enmity among them may relate to the enmity 
between the Jews and the Christians, because both are again and again referred to 
in this chapter. {Editor 's Note: That enmity has existed throughout their history, 
culminating in the atrocities against the Jews in Europe in the 20th century.) 

c (66) If they had observed the Torah and the Gospel which contained clear 
prophecies of the Prophet's advent, they would have believed in the revelation of 
the Quran as well. The eating from above is in reference to spiritual blessings and 
eating from beneath their feet signifies the earthly provisions; i.e., they would 
have had abundance of both. The attitude of liberality adopted by Islam towards 
even its most implacable foes is remarkable. Despite their strong enmity to Islam, 
some Jews and Christians are described as keeping to the moderate course. 
(Editor 's Note: It may also be meant that if Jews and Christians had acted on the 
moral teachings of their respective scriptures they would at least have not opposed 
the Prophet Muhammad, still less tried to destroy Islam.) 



5 : 67 • CHRISTIAN DEVIATION FROM THE TRUTH 153 

Section 10: Christian Deviation from the Truth 

67 O Messenger, deliver what has been revealed to you from 
your Lord; and if you do not, you have not delivered His message. 
And Allah will protect you from people. Surely Allah does not 
guide the disbelieving people." 

68 Say: O People of the Book, you follow no good till you 
observe the Torah and the Gospel and what is revealed to you 
from your Lord. And surely what has been revealed to you from 
your Lord will make many of them increase in inordinacy and dis- 
belief; so do not grieve for the disbelieving people. 69 Surely those 
who believe and those who are Jews and the Sabians and the 
Christians — whoever believes in Allah and the Last Day and 
does good — they shall have no fear nor shall they grieve. 

70 Certainly We made a covenant with the Children of Israel 
and We sent to them messengers. Whenever a messenger came to 
them with what their souls did not desire, some (of them) they 
called liars and some they (even) sought to kill. 71 And they 
thought that there would be no affliction,* so they became blind 
and deaf; then Allah turned to them (mercifully) but many of them 
(again) became blind and deaf. c And Allah is Seer of what they do. 



a (67) The promise is given here that the Holy Prophet will remain under 
Divine protection as against the innumerable dangers that threatened him from all 
quarters and the numerous plots against his life. But it also refers to the Prophet' s 
spiritual protection. God protects prophets by creating them pure from every sin 
in their very nature, keeping them firm in trials, sending down tranquillity upon 
them and protecting their hearts against evil. 

b (71-1) Although they had been repeatedly warned of the afflictions which 
would befall them, they still thought that, being a favoured nation, they would not 
suffer punishment for their evil deeds. They had been subjected to great sufferings 
at the hands of Nebuchadnezzar and the Babylonian rulers who followed him, 
large numbers having been slain and the rest taken prisoners. And again they suf- 
fered at the hands of Titus. See v. 78 where this affliction is spoken of as coming 
after David and Jesus. 

c (71-2) Allah's turning mercifully to them signifies the advent of Jesus, and 
their becoming blind and deaf a second time refers to their rejection of him.

72 Certainly they disbelieve who say: Allah, He is the Messiah, 
son of Mary. And the Messiah said: O Children of Israel, serve 
Allah, my Lord and your Lord." Surely whoever sets up partners 
with Allah, Allah has forbidden to him the Garden and his abode 
is the Fire. And for the wrongdoers there will be no helpers. 
73 Certainly they disbelieve who say: Allah is the third of the three. 
And there is no God but One God. And if they do not refrain from 
what they say, a painful punishment will surely befall such of 
them as disbelieved 74 Will they not then turn to Allah and ask His 
forgiveness? And Allah is Forgiving, Merciful. 

75 The Messiah, son of Mary, was only a messenger — 
messengers had indeed passed away before him. And his mother 
was a truthful woman. They both used to eat food. See how We 
make the messages clear to them, then see how they are turned 
away (from truth)! 76 Say: Do you serve besides Allah that which 
controls for you neither harm nor benefit? And Allah — He is the 
Hearing, the Knowing. 77 Say: O People of the Book, do not 
exaggerate in the matter of your religion unjustly, nor follow the 



a (72) "You shall worship the Lord your God, and Him only you shall serve" 
(Matthew, 4:10). 

b (73-1) The well-known Christian doctrine of the Trinity is here plainly 
referred to. It should be noted that the name of Mary is never mentioned in 
connection with the doctrine of the Trinity. But as the Christians, especially the 
Roman Catholics, invested Mary with Divine character, as being the mother of 
God, the Quran often mentions her along with Jesus as being an ordinary mortal. 

c (73-2) The doctrine of the Atonement has slowly and gradually made the 
Christian world forget God altogether, and material advancement and the 
acquisition of worldly power has become their only concern. They first sought to 
subjugate the whole world, and, having done that, they are now seeking to 
overpower each other. Their mutual hatred and enmity as a punishment for their 
violation of the covenant of God has been already clearly spoken of in v. 14, and 
again in v. 64, as also in an earlier revelation: "And on that day We shall let some 
of them surge against others" (18:99). 

d (75) Feeling hungry and partaking of food shows that both Jesus and his 
mother were ordinary mortals. Every living thing needs food; it is only the 
Supreme Being Who has no need of it. As Jesus is clearly spoken of as eating 
food while alive, he could not remain alive without food, and this verse thus 
negatives the allegation that Jesus is still alive.

Section 1 1 : Christian Nearness to Islam 

78 Those who disbelieved from among the Children of Israel 
were cursed by the tongue of David and Jesus, son of Mary. This 
was because they disobeyed and exceeded the limits. 79 They did 
not forbid one another the hateful things they did. Evil indeed was 
what they did. 80 Ybu see many of them befriending those who 
disbelieve. Certainly evil is what their souls send ahead for them, 
so that Allah is displeased with them, and in punishment will they 
abide. 81 And if they believed in Allah and the Prophet c and what 
is revealed to him, they would not take them for friends, but most 
of them are transgressors. 82 Fou will certainly find the most 
violent of people in enmity against the believers to be the Jews 
and the idolaters; and you will find the nearest in friendship to the 
believers to be those who say, We are Christians. That is because 



a (77) The exaggeration spoken of here refers to the Christian doctrine 
raising a mortal to the dignity of Godhead. The Christians are here told that in 
making this doctrine the basis of their religion they have only followed an erro- 
neous doctrine preached by people before them. Recent criticism has shown that 
the Christians have only followed previous idolatrous nations in ascribing a son to 
God. This subject has been fully discussed in The Sources of Christianity by the 
late Khwaja Kamal-ud-Din. 

b (78) After Moses, David and Jesus, who represent the highest achievement 
of Israelite prophethood in temporal and spiritual glory, spoke of the advent of the 
Holy Prophet in unmistakable terms. The curse is used here in its original sense of 
being removed further off from Divine mercy. Both prophets had warned the Jews 
that their transgressions called for Divine punishment which should soon overtake 
them if they did not mend their ways. The time of both was followed by a great 
affliction overtaking the Jews, in the respective depredations of the Babylonian 
kings and the destruction wrought by Titus. 

c (81) By al-Nabl or the Prophet in the Quran is always meant the Holy 
Prophet Muhammad, and he is often spoken of and addressed as al-Nabi or al- 
Rasul, the Prophet or the Messenger. In fact, he is referred to as the Prophet or 
that Prophet in earlier prophecy as well (John 1:21 ,25). The Jews professed belief 
in the Unity of God, yet they made a common cause with the idolatrous 
Quraish to uproot Islam which was a religion of pure monotheism.

83 And when they hear what has been revealed to the 
Messenger you see their eyes overflow with tears because of the 
truth they recognize. They say: Our Lord, we believe, so write us 
down with the witnesses.* 84 And what (reason) have we that we 
should not believe in Allah and in the Truth that has come to us, 
while we earnestly desire that our Lord should make us enter with 
the righteous people? 85 So Allah rewarded them for what they 
said, with Gardens in which rivers flow, to abide in them. And 
that is the reward of the doers of good. 86 And those who dis- 
believe and reject Our messages, such are the companions of the 
flaming fire. 

Section 12: Warning of Sins of Previous People 

87 O you who believe, do not forbid the good things which 
Allah has made lawful for you, nor exceed the limits. Surely Allah 



a (82) The Christians were nearer to Islam than the Jews, not only because 
the Muslims accepted Jesus as a prophet of God, but because there were still 
among them many people who feared and worshipped God. In the Holy Prophet's 
own time, the Negus, Christian Emperor of Abyssinia, accepted Islam; Heraclius, 
the Byzantine ruler, was favourably disposed towards it; and even the Christian 
deputation of Najran towards the end of the Prophet's life was impressed with the 
Prophet's arguments. But the words here are more of a prophetical nature. In the 
early history of Islam, Christians in Egypt, North Africa, Syria, Persia and other 
countries, accepted Islam in very large numbers and at present, too, when Islam is 
being presented to the West, the Christians are receiving the message with an 
open heart. 

b (83) This refers to the Christians who believed. An important such person- 
age was the Negus of Abyssinia, in whose dominions the Muslims found shelter 
in the early days of the Prophet's mission, when compelled to flee from Makkah 
on account of the severe persecutions of the Quraish. When the portion of the 
chapter of the Quran entitled 'Mary' dealing with Jesus Christ was read out to 
him, the words so impressed him that he wept and said that Jesus was not one 
whit more than the Quran described him to be. That he subsequently became a 
true convert to Islam is clearly shown by a funeral service having been held for 
him by the Holy Prophet when news of his death reached Madinah.

account for what is vain in your oaths, but He will call you to 
account for the making of deliberate oaths; so its expiation* is the 
feeding often poor persons with the average (food) you feed your 
families with, or their clothing, or the freeing of a slave. But 
whoever does not find (means) should fast for three days. This is 
the expiation of your oaths when you swear. And keep your oaths. 
Thus does Allah make clear to you His messages that you may 
give thanks.

a (87) Muslims are told on the one hand not to follow the self-imposed 
restrictions of Christian monks and priests, and at the same time they are warned 
against depriving themselves of Divine blessings by falling into evil habits. 

b (89) The oaths referred to are in relation to vows, etc., by which one 
forbids oneself what is otherwise lawful. The injunction at the end of this verse, 
keep your oaths, also shows that oaths cannot be violated generally, and therefore 
expiation is only allowed in the case of oaths by which a person deprives himself 
of some lawful thing or of an occasion of virtue, as in 2:226. 

c (90-1) For "stones set up" and "dividing by arrows" see 5:3 footnotes 2 
and 3. 

d (90-2) This verse totally prohibits all intoxicants and games of chance; and 
besides, by classing them with sacrifices to stones set up for idols and dividing by 
arrows, subjects them to the prohibition of 5:3. It is related that when this verse 
was revealed a crier proclaimed in the streets of Madinah that wine was prohibi- 
ted, and in response to this every jar of wine in a Muslim house was emptied, so 
that wine flowed in the streets (Bukhari, 46:20). Never in the history of the world 
was such a deep-rooted evil as drink so suddenly yet so completely eradicated. 

e (91) Only one very clear reason is here given why intoxicants and games 
of chance are forbidden. Elsewhere it is clearly stated that in intoxicants and 
games of chance there is a great sin (2:219).

their duty and believe, then keep their duty and do good (to others). 
And Allah loves the doers of good. 

Section 13: Inviolability of the Ka'bah 

94 O you who believe, Allah will certainly try you in respect 
of some game which your hands and your lances can reach, that 
Allah may know who fears Him in secret. Whoever exceeds the 
limit after this, for him is a painful punishment. 95 you who 
believe, do not kill game while you are on pilgrimage.* And who- 
ever among you kills it intentionally, the compensation of it is the 
like of what he killed, from the cattle, as two just persons among 
you judge, as an offering to be brought to the Ka'bah, or the 
expiation of it is the feeding of the poor or equivalent of it in 
fasting, that he may taste the unwholesome result of his deed. 
Allah pardons what happened in the past. And whoever returns (to 
it), Allah will punish him. And Allah is Mighty, Lord of retri- 
bution. 96 Lawful to you is the game of the sea and its food, e a 
provision for you and for the travellers, and the game of the land 
is forbidden to you so long as you are on pilgrimage, and keep 
your duty to Allah, to Whom you shall be gathered. 



a (93) The verse speaks of those who died before the prohibition came. But 
even if it is taken generally, it would not justify doing what is unlawful, because 
one who believes, does good deeds, and keeps his duty will not approach any pro- 
hibited thing. In three times mentioning belief and regard for duty, the reference is 
to the threefold duty of man, viz., to Allah, to himself, and to others. 

b (95) The prohibition to kill game when on pilgrimage, mentioned in verses 
94-96, is a token of respect for the security of the Ka'bah (see v. 97), in addition 
to being a measure necessary for the safety of life in such a large gathering. 

c (96) By the game of the sea is meant all water game, whether sea, river, 
pond, or lake. The food of the sea is here distinguished from its game, and means 
what is found having been left by the sea or river on dry land, without needing to 
be caught.

that Allah is Knower of all things. 98 Know that Allah is Severe in 
retribution and that Allah is Forgiving, Merciful. "The duty of the 
Messenger is only to deliver the message. And Allah knows what

Section 14: Some Directions for Muslims 

101 O you who believe, do not ask about things which, if 
made known to you, would give you trouble; and if you ask about

to you. Allah pardons this; and Allah is Forgiving, Forbearing/

disbelievers in them. 



a (97-1) The word Ka 'bah comes from the root meaning it swelled or 
became prominent, and it is so called because of its prominence, or it is a pro- 
phetical name showing that it shall forever have eminence in the world. Al-Bait 
al-Haram (The Sacred or Inviolable House), used here, is also one of its names, 
and among the Arabs it was known as Bait Allah, or the House of Allah. 

b (97-2) This is a prophetic announcement that the Ka'bah will forever 
remain a support or stay for mankind, where pilgrims will flock from all parts of 
the world. The words "That is that you may know that Allah knows whatever is in 
the heavens and whatever is in the earth" indicate that the fulfilment of this pro- 
phecy in all future ages will be a sign of the great knowledge of Allah, Who 
pronounced it at a time when the Ka'bah was hardly known beyond the borders of 
Arabia; see 3:97. 

c (101) Islam prohibited questions relating to details on many points which 
would require this or that practice to be made obligatory, and much was left to 
individual will or the circumstances of the time and place. The exercise of judg- 
ment occupies a very important place in Islam and this gives ample scope to 
different nations and communities to frame laws for themselves to meet new and 
changed situations. The Holy Prophet also discouraged questions on details in 
which a Muslim could choose a way for himself.

who goes astray cannot harm you when you are on the right way. 
To Allah you will all return, so He will inform you of what you

106 O you who believe, call to witness between you, when 
death draws near to one of you, at the time of making the will, two 
just persons from among you, or two others from among others 
than you, if you are travelling in the land and the calamity of 
death befalls you. You should detain them after the prayer. Then if 
you doubt (them), they shall both swear by Allah (saying): We 
will not take for it a price even for a relative, nor will we hide the 
testimony of Allah, c for then certainly we shall be sinners. 107 If it 
is discovered that they are guilty of a sin, two others shall stand up 
in their place from among those against whom the first two have 
been guilty of a sin; so they shall swear by Allah: Certainly our 
testimony is truer than the testimony of those two, and we have 
not exceeded the limit, for then surely we should be unjust. 
108 Thus it is more probable that they will give true testimony or 
fear that other oaths will be taken after their oaths. And keep your 
duty to Allah and listen. And Allah does not guide the trans- 
gressing people. 



a (103) The liberation of certain animals in honour of idols was a practice 
among the Arabs, and as Islam uprooted every vestige of idolatry, this practice is 
condemned here. The terms bahirah, sd'ibah, wasilah and hami referred to vari- 
ous types of camels and goat. 

b (106-1) The words "others than you" show that the evidence of the follow- 
ers of other religions is admissible according to the Quran, who may be chosen as 
witnesses by Muslims. 

c (106-2) "The testimony of Allah" stands for the testimony which Allah has 
enjoined to be borne uprightly.

gers and say: What was the response you received? They will say: 
We have no knowledge. Surely You are the great Knower of the

My favour to you and to your mother, when I strengthened you 
with the Holy Spirit; you spoke to people in the cradle and in old 
age, and when I taught you the Book and the Wisdom and the 
Torah and the Gospel, and when you determined out of clay a 
thing like the form of a bird by My permission, then you breathed 
into it and it became a bird by My permission; and you healed the 
blind and the leprous by My permission; and when you raised the 
dead by My permission; and when I withheld the Children of 
Israel from you when you came to them with clear arguments —

a (114-1) The word 'id used here means a festival, the literal significance 
being an ever-recurring happiness or source of enjoyment. 

b (114-2) This passage seems to refer to the well-known prayer for daily 
bread, which Jesus appears to have included in the famous Lord's prayer on 
account of the earthly inclinations of his disciples. The food of the earth has no 
doubt been granted in abundance to Christians, but this has deprived them of the 
heavenly food. The Muslim's prayer in the opening chapter of the Quran craves 
not for bread but for the right path. The form of the prayer here, that it should be 
an ever-recurring happiness, shows clearly that the prayer was not for a table 
laden with provisions, as is generally supposed. As to its being sent down from 
heaven, it should be borne in mind that, in the language of the Quran, everything 
is with God and is sent down to people; see 15:21. 

c (115) The terrible calamities which the two World Wars brought to huma- 
nity, and especially to the Christian nations, are unprecedented in human history. 
The calamities which have befallen the world today are due to the mad race for 
bread and for the wealth of this world. The neglect of the higher values of life and 
running blindly after material comforts has already brought to the world a ruin 
which it has never witnessed before. 

rf(116) From this description of Mary being taken for a god by Christians, 
some critics of the Quran conclude that it has mistakenly considered the Trinity to 
consist of the three persons — God, Jesus and Mary. However, the doctrine of the 
Trinity is not mentioned here, while the divinity of Mary is not mentioned where 
the Quran speaks of the Trinity. See 4:171 footnote 3 and 5:73 footnote 1. As to 
Mary being taken for a god, the catechism of the Roman Church includes the 
following doctrines: "That she is truly the mother of God, and the second Eve, by 
whose means we have received blessing and life; that she is the mother of Pity 
and very specially our advocate; that her images are of the utmost utility"

them are Gardens in which rivers flow, abiding therein forever. 
Allah is well pleased with them and they are well pleased with 
Allah. That is the mighty achievement. 120 AUah's is the kingdom 
of the heavens and the earth and whatever is in them; and He is 
Powerful over all things. 



a (117) This verse is a conclusive proof that Jesus died a natural death, and 
is not now alive in heaven. Here Jesus says that so long as he was among his 
followers he was a witness of their condition, and he did not find them holding the 
belief in his divinity. The logical conclusion of this statement is that the false 
doctrine of his divinity was introduced into the Christian faith after his death, 
after "You caused me to die"; see further 3:55 footnote 1. A saying of the Holy 
Prophet is recorded in which the Holy Prophet speaks concerning himself in the 
very words which are here put into the mouth of Jesus. He said that he would be 
shown on the day of Resurrection some of his followers who had gone against his 
teachings, and "I would say what the righteous servant said: I was a witness of 
them so long as I was among them, but when You caused me to die, You were the 
Watcher over them" (Bukhari, 60:8). 

b (118) The words tagkfir la-hum {protect them ox forgive them) refer to 
their final protection which will be granted to the Christian nations through accep- 
tance of Islam. If the forgiveness of sins was meant, the Divine attributes referred 
to would have been those speaking of forgiveness and mercy, as the Forgiving, 
the Merciful. Instead of that the attributes referred to are the Mighty, the Wise, 
which generally indicate that some great purpose would be achieved and a trans- 
formation would be brought about. 



Chapter 6 

Al-An'am Cattle 

The name of this chapter refers to certain superstitious and idolatrous practices 
of the pre-Islamic Arabs (v. 142-144) which were to be abolished to establish 
the doctrine of Divine Unity. The chapter deals with this doctrine at length, 
presents evidence to prove its truth and declares its ultimate triumph over 
idolatry and all other kinds of polytheism. This chapter was revealed at 
Makkah in the last year of the phase of the Holy Prophet's life there. 



Section 1 : Ultimate Triumph of Divine Unity 

In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful. 

1 Praise be to Allah, Who created the heavens and the earth, 
and made darkness and light. Yet those who disbelieve set up 
equals to their Lord." 2 He it is Who created you from clay, then 
He decreed a term. And there is a term named with Him; still you 
doubt.* 3 And He is Allah in the heavens and in the earth. He 
knows your secret (thoughts) and your open (words), and He knows 
what you earn.' 



a (1) The words that Allah is the Maker of darkness and light are directed 
against the dualistic doctrine of the Magian religion, which holds light and dark- 
ness to be two co-eternal principles. The religion of Islam is the purest mono- 
theism, and thus it holds that the ultimate cause of all things is the Great Maker of 
the heavens and the earth. Pure monotheism holds out before mankind the bright 
hope that, as goodness is inherent in the Divine Being, it is also the goal to which 
the creation moves on; while dualism considers the prevalence of evil to be 
necessary. 

b (2) The first term is that of life and the second the Resurrection. All 
humans are here said to be created from clay, which means, in the case of Adam 
as well as human beings generally, that the earth is the original source, and dust 
the first stage, of life. 

c (3) Life in Resurrection, spoken of in the previous verse, is here stated to 
be the result of man's own actions, which, whether done secretly or openly, are 
known to God. It is out of what you earn that He shapes a new life for you.

6 : 4 • ULTIMATE TRIUMPH OF DIVINE UNITY 1 65 

4 And no message comes to them of the messages of their 
Lord but they turn away from it. 5 So they rejected the truth when 
it came to them, but soon will come to them the news of what they 
mocked. 6 Do they not see how many a generation We destroyed 
before them, whom We had established in the earth as We have 
not established you, and We sent clouds pouring abundant rain on 
them, and We made rivers flow beneath them? Then We des- 
troyed them for their sins, and raised up after them another 
generation. 

7 And if We had sent down to you a writing on paper, then 
they had touched it with their hands, those who disbelieve would 
have said: This is nothing but clear enchantment." 8 And they say: 
Why has not an angel been sent down to him? And if We send 
down an angel, the matter would be decided and then they would 
not be given respite. 9 And if We had made him an angel, We 
would certainly have made him a man, and (thus) made confused 
to them what they confuse. c 10 And messengers before you were 
indeed mocked, but that which they derided befell those of them 
who scoffed/ 



a (7) If truth had been sent down to man in the physical form of a book, and 
had not been revealed to the mind of man, it could not bring about a transforma- 
tion in the minds of human beings. But even if it had taken a physical shape, they 
would have called it an enchantment, and still rejected it. 

b (8) They wanted to see the spiritual reality of the angel in a physical form. 
The presence of angels was felt by the righteous in the transformation which they 
worked in their hearts but the hearts of the wicked were impervious to all good, 
and hence the only form in which the angels could make their presence felt to 
them was by punishing them for their evil deeds. Hence the coming of the angels 
to the guilty is always spoken of in the Quran as being synonymous with the 
infliction of the punishment with which they were threatened. Compare 2:210 and 
v. 158 of this chapter. 

c (9) If an angel were made a messenger to mankind, he would doubtless 
appear in the form of a man as the physical eye cannot see angels. Thus there 
would still be the same confusion in their minds as when a human being was en- 
trusted with the Divine message. Moreover only a human being could serve as a 
model for people. 

d (10) They ridiculed the idea of the Prophet and the believers being trium- 
phant. Truth had always triumphed, they are told, and it would triumph even now.

Section 2: Greatness of Divine Mercy 

11 Say: Travel in the land, then see what was the end of the 
rejectors. 12 Say: To whom belongs whatever is in the heavens and 
the earth? Say: To Allah. He has ordained mercy on Himself." He 
will certainly gather you on the day of Resurrection — there is no 
doubt about it. Those who have lost their souls, they will not 
believe. 13 And to Him belongs whatever dwells in the night and 
the day. And He is the Hearing, the Knowing. 

14 Say: Shall I take for a friend other than Allah, the Origina- 
tor of the heavens and the earth, and He feeds and is not fed? Say: 
I am commanded to be the first of those who submit. And do not 
be of those who set up partners (with Allah). 15 Say: Surely I fear, 
if I disobey my Lord, the punishment of a grievous day. 16 He from 
whom it is averted on that day, Allah indeed has had mercy on 
him. And this is a manifest achievement. 17 And if Allah touch you 
with affliction, there is none to remove it but He. And if He touch 
you with good, He is Powerful over all things. 18 And He is the 
Supreme, above His servants. And He is the Wise, the Aware. 

19 Say: What thing is of most weight in testimony? Say: Allah 
is witness between you and me. And this Quran has been revealed 
to me that with it I may warn you and whomsoever it reaches. c Do 
you really bear witness that there are other gods with Allah? Say: I 
do not bear witness. Say: He is only One God, and surely I am 
innocent of what you set up (with Him). 20 Those whom We have 
given the Book recognize him as they recognize their sons. Those 
who have lost their souls, they will not believe. 



a (12) The words He has ordained mercy on Himself 'imply that mercy is in 
fact His very nature. The evidence of Divine mercy is manifest in the physical 
world: He has created all things for the benefit of man. Would He not deal equally 
mercifully with man in his spiritual needs and send a revelation to guide him? 

b (17) The meaning is: Allah, being All-powerful, will bring good to you. 

c (19) The Holy Prophet was thus a warner, not for the Arabs only, but for 
all people whom the Quran may reach, i.e. for the whole world. 

d (20) For as they recognize their sons, see 2: 146 and footnote. 



6:21' POLYTHEISTS' WITNESS AGAINST THEMSELVES 167 

Section 3: Polytheists' Witness against themselves 

21 And who is more unjust than one who forges a lie about 
Allah, or calls His messages a lie? Surely the wrongdoers will not 
be successful. 22 And on the day We gather them all together, then 
We shall say to those who set up partners (with Allah): Where are 
your associate-gods whom you asserted? 23 Then their excuse 
would be nothing but that they would say: By Allah, our Lord! we 
did not set up partners. 24 See how they lie against their own souls, 
and what they forged shall fail them! 25 And some of them listen to 
you and We have cast veils over their hearts so that they do not 
understand it and a deafness into their ears. And (even) if they see 
every sign they will not believe in it. a So much so that when they 
come to you they only dispute with you — those who disbelieve 
say: This is nothing but stories of the ancients. 

26 And they forbid (others) from it, and they keep away from 
it; and they ruin none but their own souls while they do not per- 
ceive. 27 And if you could see when they are made to stand before 
the Fire, and say: If only we were sent back, we would not reject 
the messages of our Lord but would be from among the believers. 
28 No, what they concealed before will become manifest to them. 
And if they were sent back, they would certainly go back to what 
they are forbidden, and surely they are liars. 29 And they say: 
There is nothing but our life of this world and we shall not be 
raised again. 30 And if you could see when they are made to stand 
before their Lord! He will say: Is not this the truth? They will say: 
Certainly, by our Lord! He will say: Taste then the punishment 
because you disbelieved. 



a (25) Veils were cast over their hearts because they would not believe even 
if they saw all the signs. As the words that follow show, they came to the Prophet, 
not for the purpose of listening to and pondering over what he said, but to dispute 
with him. The veils were due to their own actions; see 2:10 and footnote. 

b (28) The evil consequences of their deeds were hidden in this life, but they 
will become manifest in the life after death. And since, if they were sent back, the 
evil consequences of evil deeds would again be hidden from the physical eye they 
would revert to evil deeds. 



168 6. CATTLE -6:31 

Section 4: Rejection of the Truth 

31 They are losers indeed who reject the meeting with Allah, 
until when the hour comes upon them suddenly," they will say: 
O our grief for our neglecting it! And they bear their burdens on 
their backs. Now surely evil is what they bear! 32 And this world's 
life is but an idle sport and play. And certainly the abode of the 
Hereafter is better for those who keep their duty. Do you not then 
understand? 33 We know indeed that what they say grieves you, for 
surely they do not call you a liar, but the wrongdoers deny the 
messages of Allah. 34 And messengers indeed were rejected before 
you, but they were patient when rejected and persecuted, until Our 
help came to them. And there is none to change the words of 
Allah. c And there has already come to you some information about 
the messengers. 35 And if their turning away is hard on you, then, if 
you can, seek an opening into the earth or a ladder to heaven, to 
bring them a sign!'' And if Allah pleased, He would certainly have 
gathered them all to guidance, so do not be from among the igno- 
rant. 36 0nly those accept who listen. And (as for) the dead, Allah 
will raise them, then to Him they will be returned. 6 



a (31) By the hour is meant their doom, as well as the hour of the final judg- 
ment. 

b (33) The Holy Prophet was known among them as al-Amln, i.e., the 
Faithful or the Truthful one. His worst enemies at the height of their enmity 
admitted that he had never told a lie. It was after he received the Divine revelation 
that he was called a liar, and hence it was really a denial of the Divine revelation, 
not a denial as to the Prophet's truthfulness. 

c (34) The context shows that by the words of Allah here are meant the 
prophecies foretelling the triumph of Truth and the overthrow of all opposition. 

d (35) By sign is meant a sign that should bring all to guidance. Their doom 
was pronounced, and that word must be fulfilled, as affirmed in the previous 
verse; but the demand of the people to be overawed into an immediate submission 
to the Prophet by a sign was not in accordance with the Divine Law. 

e (36) Those addressed by the Holy Prophet are here divided into two classes: 
(1) those who listen: they accept him and become believers; (2) those who are 
spiritually dead and pay no heed to his warning. Even the latter are not to be 
despaired of, for Allah will raise them too to spiritual life. Their being returned to 
Allah stands here for their ultimate acceptance of the Truth. 



6 : 37 • CONSEQUENCES OF REJECTION 169 

37 And they say: Why has not a sign been sent down to him 
from his Lord? Say: Surely Allah is Able to send down a sign, but 
most of them do not know." 38 And there is no animal in the earth, 
nor a bird that flies on its two wings, but (they are) communities 
like yourselves. We have not neglected anything in the Book. Then 
to their Lord will they be gathered. 39 And those who reject Our 
messages are deaf and dumb, in darkness. Whom Allah pleases He 
leaves in error. And whom He pleases He places on the right way. 
40 Say: See, if the punishment of Allah overtake you or the hour 
come upon you, will you call on others than Allah, if you are 
truthful? 41 No, Him you call upon, so He removes that for which 
you pray, if He pleases, and you forget what you set up as partners 
(with Him). 

Section 5: Consequences of Rejection 

42 And indeed We sent (messengers) to nations before you 
then We seized them with distress and affliction that they might 
humble themselves. 43 Yet why did they not, when Our punishment 
came to them, humble themselves? But their hearts hardened and 
the devil made all that they did seem good to them. 44 Then, when 
they neglected what they had been admonished with, We opened 
for them the gates of all things. c Until, when they rejoiced in what 
they were given, We seized them suddenly; then they were in 



a (37) Allah did send the very sign demanded, as we find the Arabs sub- 
mitting to the Holy Prophet almost in a body after the conquest of Makkah. 

b (38) Other creatures are all provided for by Allah as human beings are, so 
far as physical needs are concerned. But man's nature aspires to something higher, 
and it is to satisfy that spiritual craving that prophets are sent. This verse, more- 
over, points, as it were, to two classes of people — those who, like beasts, are 
wholly bent on earth and cannot rise, and those who rise like birds, soaring 
upward to the higher spiritual regions. The concluding words of the verse — then 
to their Lord will they be gathered — are in reference to mankind and, as com- 
pared with other animals, point to the Higher life, the life eternal in God. There is 
no mention here or anywhere else in the Quran of the lower animals being raised 
to a new life for Judgment. 

c (44) By opening the gates of all things is meant that all comforts of life 
were made accessible to them. 



170 6. CATTLE -6:45 

utter despair! 45 So the roots of the people who did wrong were cut 
off. And praise be to Allah, the Lord of the worlds." 

46 Say: Have you considered that if Allah should take away 
your hearing and your sight and seal your hearts, who is the god 
besides Allah that can bring it to you? See how We repeat the 
messages yet they turn away! 47 Say: See, if the punishment of 
Allah should overtake you suddenly or openly, will any be des- 
troyed but the wrongdoing people? 48 And We do not send 
messengers but as bearers of good news and warners; then whoever 
believes and acts aright, they shall have no fear, nor shall they 
grieve. 49 And as for those who reject Our messages, punishment 
will afflict them because they transgressed. 50 Say: I do not say to 
you, I have with me the treasures of Allah, nor do I know the 
unseen, nor do I say to you that I am an angel; I follow only what 
is revealed to me. Say: Are the blind and the seeing alike? Do you 
not then reflect? 

Section 6: Reward of Believers 

51 And warn with it those who fear that they will be gathered 
to their Lord — there is no protector for them, nor any intercessor 
besides Him — so that they may keep their duty. 52 And do not 
drive away those who call upon their Lord, morning and evening, 
desiring only His pleasure. Neither are you accountable for them 
at all, nor are they accountable for you at all, that you should drive 
them away and thus be one of the wrongdoers. c 53 And thus do We 



a (45) By cutting off the roots is meant the destruction of the ringleaders in 
particular. 

b (50) Appearing among a superstitious and ignorant people, the Holy 
Prophet could have claimed any supernatural powers for himself. But he told them 
plainly that he was a man who had no treasures, nor did he lay claim as a man to 
know the secrets of the future, nor did he profess to be any more than a mortal. 
Allah had revealed His will to him, and he faithfully followed and translated into 
practice everything that he received from on High. And as he himself was, so he 
wanted others to be. The unique greatness of the Prophet lies in the fact that he 
never tried to put himself before people as superhuman. 

c (52) This verse was revealed when some leading Quraish expressed their

try some of them by others so that they say: Are these they upon 
whom Allah has conferred benefit from among us? " Does not 
Allah best know the grateful? 54 And when those who believe in 
Our messages come to you, say: Peace be on you, your Lord has 
ordained mercy on Himself, (so) that if anyone of you does evil in 
ignorance, then turns after that and acts aright, then He is For- 
giving, Merciful. 55 And thus do We make distinct the messages so 
that the way of the guilty may become clear. 

Section 7: Divine Judgment 

56 Say: I am forbidden to serve those whom you call upon 
besides Allah. Say: I do not follow your low desires, for then 
indeed I should go astray and should not be of the guided ones. 
57 Say: Surely I have manifest proof from my Lord and you call it a 
lie. I do not have with me (the power to bring) what you seek to 
hasten. The judgment is only Allah's. He relates the truth and He 
is the Best of deciders. 58 Say: If I had with me (the power to 
bring) what you seek to hasten, the matter would have certainly 
been decided between you and me. And Allah best knows the 
wrongdoers. 

59 And with Him are the treasures of the unseen — none 
knows them but He. And He knows what is in the land and the 
sea. And no leaf falls but He knows it, nor is there a grain in the 
darkness of the earth, nor anything green or dry, but (it is all) in a 
clear book. 60 And He it is Who takes your souls at night, and He 

willingness to accept the Prophet if the poorer Muslims were not allowed to 
remain in his company at the time. The poor and the rich are here brought to the 
same level; they have equal claims to learn and practise the truth. Truth is equally 
accessible to all. To the religion of Islam, no aristocracy is known. Before the 
Great Master the differences of rank, wealth and colour sink into insignificance, 
and therefore before Allah's Messenger, as before Allah Himself, they must all 
stand upon one level. Everyone is answerable for what he does is the golden prin- 
ciple preached by Islam. 

a (53) The simple and decisive answer given above no doubt wounded the 
pride of the wealthy Quraish, who were required to sit along with the poor slaves 
whom they never treated as human beings, and thus they were tried. 

b (59) The clear book is the great law of cause and effect. The falling of the

knows what you earn by day, then He raises you up in it that an 
appointed term may be fulfilled. Then to Him is your return, then 
He will inform you of what you did. 

Section 8: Divine Judgment 

61 And He is the Supreme above His servants, and He sends 
keepers over you; until when death comes to one of you, Our 
messengers cause him to die, and they are not remiss. 62 Then are 
they sent back to Allah, their Master, the True one. Now surely 
His is the judgment and He is swiftest in taking account. 

63 Say: Who is it that delivers you from the calamities of the 
land and the sea? (When) you call upon Him, in humility and in 
secret: If He deliver us from this, we will certainly be of the 
grateful ones. 64 Say: Allah delivers you from this and from every 
distress, yet you set up partners (with Him). 65 Say: He has the 
power to send on you a punishment from above you or from 
beneath your feet, or to throw you into confusion, (making you) of 
different factions, and make some of you taste the violence of 
others. See how We repeat the messages that they may under- 
stand!" 



leaf indicates that its power to draw nourishment has come to an end; thus do 
individuals and nations fall. The grain in the darkness of the earth stands for the 
mission of the Prophet, for that grain was destined to sprout forth, growing into a 
tree of exceptional proportions. The "green" indicates those people that prosper 
and the "dry" those that must fall off. 

a (65) The three forms of punishment were witnessed by the Holy Prophet's 
opponents later on. A punishment from above took the form of a storm during the 
well-known battle of the Allies, when an army between ten and twenty thousand 
strong took to flight on account of a great storm; a punishment from beneath took 
the form of a drought which brought great affliction upon the people of Makkah 
for seven years; while they were made to taste the violence at the hands of the 
Muslims in the battles which they themselves started and which brought about the 
final disruption of the power of the Quraish. Applied to the modern West, the 
punishment from above and punishment from below are, respectively, the tyranny 
of the bourgeois and the tyranny of the proletariate. The capitalists first tyrannized 
labour and then communism wreaked vengeance on the capitalists. To these two 
punishments is now added a third. The whole world is divided into parties which 
aim at each other's destruction and the violence of man against man has reached a

66 And your people call it a lie and it is the Truth. Say: I am 
not put in charge of you. 67 For every prophecy is a term, and you 
will soon come to know (it). a 68 And when you see those who talk 
nonsense about Our messages, withdraw from them until they 
enter into some other discourse. And if the devil cause you to 
forget, then do not sit after recollection with the unjust people. 
69 And those who keep their duty are not accountable for them at 
all but (theirs) is only to remind; perhaps they may guard against 
evil. 

70 And leave those who take their religion for a play and an 
idle sport, and whom this world's life has deceived, and remind 
(people) with this (message) in case a soul be destroyed for what it 
has earned. It has besides Allah no friend nor intercessor, and 
though it offer every compensation, it will not be accepted from it. 
Those are they who are destroyed for what they earn. For them is 
a drink of boiling water and a painful punishment, because they 
disbelieved. 

Section 9: Abraham's Argument for Divine Unity 

71 Say: Shall we call, besides Allah, on that which does not 
benefit us nor harm us, and shall we be turned back on our heels 
after Allah has guided us? Like one whom the devils cause to 
follow his low desires, in bewilderment in the earth — he has 
companions who call him to the right way (saying), Come to us. 
Say: Surely the guidance of Allah, that is the (true) guidance. And 
we are commanded to submit to the Lord of the worlds, 72 and that 
you should keep up prayer and keep your duty to Him. And He it 
is to Whom you shall be gathered. 73 And He it is Who created the 



peak unthought of by the world. Whole cities with their millions of residents are 
turned into graves in the twinkling of an eye, and this wholesale destruction of 
man by man is considered as the greatest feat of material civilization. 

a (67) The prophecy of the vanquishment of the powerful opponents of 
Islam is declared with even greater emphasis than in the earlier stage of the Pro- 
phet's mission, despite the apparent triumph of opposition to his cause which had 
succeeded in scattering the few people who accepted Islam.

heavens and the earth with truth. And when He says, Be, it is. fl His 
word is the truth and His is the kingdom on the day when the 
trumpet is blown.* The Knower of the unseen and the seen; and 
He is the Wise, the Aware. 

74 And when Abraham said to his sire, Azar: c Do you take 
idols for gods? Surely I see you and jour people in manifest error. 
75 And thus did We show Abraham the kingdom of the heavens 
and the earth and that he might have certainty. d 76 So when the 
night overshadowed him, he saw a star. He said: Is this my Lord? e 
So when it set, he said: I do not love the setting ones. 77 Then when 
he saw the moon rising, he said: Is this my Lord? So when it set, 



a (73-1) These words are generally used when the bringing about of a great 
change — a change which seems to be impossible to people — is meant. 

b (73-2) The reference may be either to the Resurrection when human beings 
will be raised to be brought to judgment, or the great spiritual resurrection which 
was to be brought about through the Holy Prophet when the whole of Arabia was 
destined to receive a new life, the life spiritual, or perhaps to the still greater spiri- 
tual resurrection when the whole of humanity was destined to receive a new life 
through the triumph of Islam. 

c (74) Whether Azar was the father of Abraham, or his grandfather or uncle, 
is a much disputed point. The word ab means a father as well as an ancestor, and 
in 2:133 it is applied to an uncle because there Ishmael is spoken of as an ab of 
Jacob. Abraham's father (walid) is indicated in 14:41 to be a believer, while the 
sire (ab) is elsewhere mentioned as having stuck to idolatry till his death (9:114). 
Hence I prefer sire as the significance of the word. 

d (75) Showing Abraham the kingdom of the heavens and the earth signifies 
granting him an insight into the Divine laws of nature working in the kingdom of 
the heavens and the earth. This insight had convinced him that Allah was the real 
controller of the universe, while the sun, the moon, the stars and other heavenly 
bodies, were only His creation and subject to His laws. 

e (76) These words, which literally mean this is my Lord, do not contain 
Abraham's conviction. The words are either uttered by way of surprise or, as trans- 
lated here, the phrase may be interrogatory, expressing disapproval. It should be 
borne in mind that Abraham never worshipped idols or the heavenly bodies like 
his people. He has already been spoken of in v. 74 as denouncing the idol-worship 
of his people, and in v. 75 as possessing certainty of faith in One God. Further on, 
we find it clearly stated in v. 83 that what is related here was an argument by 
which Abraham tried to convince his people that they worshipped false deities, 
which were themselves subject to Divine laws. 



6:78' ABRAHAM'S ARGUMENT FOR DIVINE UNITY 1 75 

he said: If my Lord had not guided me, I should certainly be of the 
people who are in error. 78 Then when he saw the sun rising, he 
said: Is this my Lord? Is this the greatest? So when it set, he said: 
My people, I am clear of what you set up (with Allah). 79 Surely I 
have turned myself, being upright, wholly to Him Who originated 
the heavens and the earth, and I am not of those who set up partners 
(with Allah). 

80 And his people disputed with him. He said: Do you dispute 
with me respecting Allah and He has guided me indeed? And I do 
not fear in any way those that you set up with Him, unless my 
Lord please. My Lord comprehends all things in His knowledge. 
Will you not then be mindful? 81 And how should I fear what you 
have set up (with Him), while you do not fear to set up partners 
with Allah for which He has sent down to you no authority? 
Which then of the two parties is surer of security, if you know? 
82 Those who believe and do not mix up their faith with wrong- 
doing — for them is security and they go aright.

83 And this was Our argument which We gave to Abraham 
against his people. We exalt in degrees whom We please. Surely 
your Lord is Wise, Knowing. 84 And We gave him Isaac and Jacob. 
Each did We guide; and Noah did We guide before, and of his 
descendants, David and Solomon and Job and Joseph and Moses 
and Aaron. And thus do We reward those who do good (to others), 
85 and Zacharias and John and Jesus and Elias; each one (of them) 
was of the righteous, 86 and Ishmael and Elisha and Jonah and Lot; 
and each one (of them) We made to excel the people; 87 and some 
of their fathers and their descendants and their brethren. And We 
chose them and guided them to the right way. 

88 This is Allah's guidance with which He guides whom He 
pleases of His servants. And if they had set up partners (with Him), 
all that they did would have been fruitless. 89 These are they to 



176 6. CATTLE -6:90 

whom We gave the Book and authority and prophecy. " Therefore 
if these disbelieve in it, We have indeed entrusted it to a people 
who are not disbelievers in it. 90 These are they whom Allah guided, 
so follow their guidance. Say: I do not ask you for any reward for 
it. It is nothing but a Reminder for the nations. 

Section 1 1 : Truth of Divine Revelation 

91 And they do not honour Allah with the honour due to Him, 
when they say: Allah has not revealed anything to a mortal. c Say: 
Who revealed the Book which Moses brought, a light and a gui- 
dance to people — you make it into (scattered) papers, which you 



a (89) Each one of the prophets was given three things. The first was the 
Kitdb, the Book, or the Divine revelation which the prophet was granted to guide 
people aright. The second is called hukm, which means authority to judge. This 
shows that every prophet received authority directly from God, and it was by 
Divine authority that he judged his people. The third is nubuwwat, which means 
prophethood or the gift of prophecy. The Book contains directions for guidance of 
the people and nubuwwat is the prophetical part which is meant to strengthen faith. 
Thus the Holy Prophet Muhammad was granted the gift of prophecy long before 
he was granted the Book which began with the words, Read in the name of your 
Lord (96: 1). Further there is a vast number of his prophecies which are contained 
in the Hadith and which do not form a part of the Book, the Quran. 

b (90) The Prophet is told to follow the guidance of all the earlier prophets 
because his message was for all the nations to whom previous prophets had sepa- 
rately come. Hence the Quran is called a Reminder, showing that it was meant for 
all the nations, to whom it was a reminder of what they had received before. The 
Prophet is, in fact, here told that he was now the representative of all the prophets 
that had gone before him, and therefore possessed all the excellences which were 
granted to those prophets separately. 

c (91-1) The words Allah has not revealed anything to a mortal may mean a 
total denial of God revealing Himself to man or simply a denial of revelation to 
the Holy Prophet. The Jews and the Christians are told in this verse that the same 
God Who revealed a book to Moses, containing a clear prophecy of a prophet like 
him, has now in fulfilment of that prophecy sent the like of Moses. Their only 
answer to that clear prophecy was that they would not mention it or talk of it at all 
— and you conceal much. The deniers of Divine revelation are also told, more 
generally, that the proof of revelation was in the knowledge which it gave — you 
are taught what neither you nor your fathers knew. 

rf(91-2) The book was not kept intact, hence its description as scattered 
papers.

show and you conceal much? And you are taught what neither you 
nor your fathers knew. Say: Allah. Then leave them sporting in 
their idle talk. 92 And this is a Blessed Book We have revealed, 
verifying what is (already) before it, and that you may warn the 
mother-town " and those around it. And those who believe in the 
Hereafter believe in it, and they keep a guard over their prayers. 

93 And who is more unjust than he who forges a lie against 
Allah, or says, Revelation has been granted to me, while nothing 
has been revealed to him; and he who says: I can reveal the like of 
what Allah has revealed? ' And if you could see when the wrong- 
doers are in the agonies of death and the angels stretch forth their 
hands, (saying): Yield up your souls. This day you are awarded a 
punishment of disgrace because you spoke against Allah other 
than truth, and (because) you scorned His messages. 94 And cer- 
tainly you have come to Us one by one as We created you at first, 
and you have left behind your backs what We gave you. And We 
do not see with you your intercessors about whom you asserted 
that they were (Allah's) partners in respect to you. Certainly the 
ties between you are now cut off and what you asserted has failed 
you. 

Section 12: Ultimate Triumph of the Truth 

95 Surely Allah causes the grain and the date-stone to germi- 
nate. He brings forth the living from the dead and He is the bringer 
forth of the dead from the living. That is Allah. How are you then 
turned away (from truth)! e 96 He is the cleaver of the daybreak; 



a (92) Umm al-Qura or the mother of the towns is the title by which Makkah 
is known. The reason is not only that it was both the political and the spiritual 
centre of Arabia, but also because it was destined to be the universal spiritual 
centre — the real mother of the whole world. 

b (93) These words declare the Holy Prophet free of having forged a lie 
against Allah. The claim "I can reveal the like of what Allah has revealed" are the 
words of those who refuse to believe in the truth of Divine revelation. 

c (95) The preaching of the Holy Prophet is likened to the sowing of the seed 
which, though to all appearance it is lost in the earth, soon springs forth into a 
large tree. The bringing forth the living from the dead is the bringing forth a living

follow the right way by them in the darkness of the land and the

single soul, then there is (for you) an abode and a repository/

from it green (foliage), from which We produce clustered grain; 
and of the date-palm, of the sheaths of it, come forth clusters (of 
dates) within reach; and gardens of grapes and the olive and the 
pomegranate, alike and unlike. Look at the fruit of it when it bears 
fruit and the ripening of it. Surely there are signs in this for a 
people who believe! i°°And they regard the jinn to be partners with 
Allah, and He created them, and they falsely attribute to Him sons 
and daughters without knowledge. Glory be to Him, and supreme- 
ly exalted is He above what they ascribe (to Him)! 



people from the spiritually dead Arabs, and the bringing forth the dead from the 
living alludes to the spiritual death of those who had been previously granted spiri- 
tual life through Divine revelation. 

a (96) The darkness prevailing in the earth would soon be dispelled, and 
would give place to light, even as, with the break of the morning, darkness gives 
place to light. 

b (97) The Holy Prophet is likened to the sun, and those who receive light 
from him and transmit it to others are likened to the stars. The analogy is that He 
Who makes light to guide you physically could not have neglected your spiritual 
guidance. 

c (98) The abode may indicate this life and the repository the grave. 

d (100) The reference is either to the dualistic doctrine of the Magi, who 
thought that while Allah was the creator of good, the devil was the creator of evil, 
or to the Arab belief that the jinn had a hand in the transaction of their affairs, or 
in bringing them good fortune or ill luck. 



6:101' GRADUAL PROGRESS 179 

Section 13: Gradual Progress 

101 Wonderful Originator of the heavens and the earth! How 
could He have a son when He has no consort? And He created 
everything, and He is the Knower of all things." 102 That is Allah, 
your Lord. There is no god but He, the Creator of all things; there- 
fore serve Him, and He has charge of all things. 103 Vision cannot 
comprehend Him, and He comprehends (all) vision; and He is the 
Knower of subtleties, the Aware. 

104 Clear proofs have indeed come to you from your Lord; so 
whoever sees, it is for the good of his own soul; and whoever is 
blind, it is to its harm. And I am not a keeper over you. 105 And 
thus do We repeat the messages, and that they may say, 7ou have 
studied; and that We may make it clear to a people who know. 
106 Follow what is revealed to you from jour Lord — there is no 
god but He; and turn away from those who set up partners (with 
Allah). 107 And if Allah had pleased, they would not have set up 
others (with Him). And We have not appointed you a keeper over 
them, and you are not in charge of them. 

108 And do not abuse those whom they call upon besides 
Allah, in case, exceeding the limits, they abuse Allah through 
ignorance. c Thus to every people have We made their deeds seem 
good; then to their Lord is their return so He will inform them of 
what they did. 109 And they swear their strongest oaths by Allah 
that if a sign comes to them they would certainly believe in it. 
Say: Signs are with Allah. And what should make you know that 
when they come they do not believe? 110 And We turn their hearts 



a (101) This verse and those that follow describe the transcendental Unity of 
the Divine Being. To attribute a son to Him is to acknowledge that He had a con- 
sort; otherwise the word son will have to be taken simply as a metaphor. 

b (103) The physical vision of man, working as it does only within narrow 
limits and being able only to see bodies, cannot comprehend the Infinite One. He 
is the all-pervading Spirit, and can be seen only with the spiritual eye. 

c (108) Here Muslims are forbidden to abuse even the idols of other people, 
though their worship is condemned in the strongest terms. 

rf(109) Many signs of the Holy Prophet's truth had appeared while he was

and their sights, just as they did not believe in it the first time; and 
We leave them in their inordinacy, blindly wandering on." 

Section 14: Idolaters' Opposition 

111 And even if We send down to them the angels and the 
dead speak to them and We bring together all things before them, 
they would not believe unless Allah please, but most of them are 
ignorant. 112 And thus did We make for every prophet an enemy, 
the devils from among the people and the jinn, some of them 
inspiring others with gilded speech to deceive (them)^ And if your 
Lord pleased, they would not do it, so leave them alone with what 
they forge — 113 And that the hearts of those who do not believe in 
the Hereafter may incline to it, and that they may be pleased with 
it, and that they may earn what they are earning. 

114 Shall I then seek a judge other than Allah, when He it is 
Who has sent down to you the Book fully explained. And those 

still at Makkah, but they still went on demanding signs. The reply, "signs are with 
Allah", means that the sign which they demanded would be shown and that Allah 
had the power to show all kinds of signs. But even then they would not believe. 
The first sign of the overthrow of the power of the Quraish appeared in the battle 
of Badr, but they did not believe even then. 

a (110) The turning of their hearts and sights is Allah 's leaving them in their 
inordinacy, as explained by the verse itself. And even this is due to their own 
action in rejecting the truth. When an attitude of enmity is assumed towards the 
truth, the heart becomes estranged from it, and this growing estrangement is term- 
ed the turning away of the heart from it. 

b (111) There are always some people who turn a deaf ear to every argu- 
ment, and it is of such leaders of evil that this verse speaks; see next verse. The 
coming of the angels stands for the execution of the decree of their punishment. 
The speaking of the dead refers either to the raising of the spiritually dead to life 
(see v. 122), or to the evidence of those who had passed away before the Prophet, 
being given through their writings. And lastly, by the bringing together of all 
things is meant the bringing together of things relating to their punishment. The 
meaning is that some of the opponents are so blind that the clearest of signs or 
proofs would not convince them. 

c (112) By the people and the jinn here are apparently meant the ordinary 
people and the leaders, suggesting to each other varnished tales of falsehood. See 
later v. 128 footnote 1 for a fuller discussion of the word /mo.

whom We have given the Book know that it is revealed by your 
Lord with truth, so do not be one of the disputers. 115 And the word 
of jour Lord has been accomplished truly and justly. There is 
none who can change His words; and He is the Hearer, the 
Knower." 116 And if you obey most of those in the earth, they will 
lead you astray from Allah's way. They follow nothing but con- 
jecture, and they only lie. 117 Surely jour Lord — He knows best 
who goes astray from His way, and He knows best the guided 
ones. 

118 Eat, then, of that on which Allah's name has been men- 
tioned, if you are believers in His messages. 119 And what reason 
have you that you should not eat of that on which Allah's name is 
mentioned, when He has already made plain to you what He has 
forbidden to you — except what you are compelled to. c And 
surely many lead (people) astray by their low desires through 
ignorance. Surely jour Lord — He best knows the transgressors. 
120 And avoid open sins and secret ones. Surely they who earn sin 
will be rewarded for what they have earned. 121 And do not eat of 
that on which Allah's name has not been mentioned, and that is 
surely a transgression. 2 And certainly the devils inspire their friends 



a (115) The word signifies the prophetic word; see 6:34 footnote. 

b (118) The establishment of the doctrine of Divine Unity, which is the object 
of this chapter, required the abolition of all idolatrous practices, among which was 
the practice of slaughtering animals in the names of idols. It is allowed to Mus- 
lims to slaughter animals for food, but Allah's name must be mentioned when the 
animal is slaughtered. This is also a reminder to man that this act of the taking of 
a life, even though it is the life of an animal, is made lawful only by Divine per- 
mission, for the attainment of a necessary purpose. 

c (119) The reference in these words is to what is said in an earlier revela- 
tion; see 16:115. The same subject is again referred to in 6:145, as also in 2:173 
and in greater detail in 5:3, both of these being revelations at Madinah. 

d (120) The Muslim is here commanded to consider open and secret sins to 
be equally hateful. In fact there are very few people who commit open sins as 
compared with those who are guilty of secret sins. 

e (121) These words are explained by the majority as containing only a pro- 
hibition against the eating of that which is slaughtered in the name of others than 
Allah.

to contend with you; and if you obey them, you will surely be 
those who set up partners (with Allah). 

Section 15: The Chief Opponents 

122 Is he who was dead, then We raised him to life and made 
for him a light by which he walks among the people, like him 
whose likeness is that of one in darkness from which he cannot 
come forth? a Thus their doings are made to seem good to the dis- 
believers. 123 And thus have We made in every town the leaders of 
its guilty ones, that they may make plans in it. And they plan only 
against themselves, and they do not perceive. 124 And when a message 
comes to them they say: We will not believe till we are given the 
like of what Allah's messengers are given. Allah best knows where 
to place His message. Humiliation from Allah and severe punish- 
ment will surely befall the guilty for their planning. 

125 So whomsoever Allah intends to guide, He expands his 
breast for Islam, and whomsoever He intends to leave in error, He 
makes his breast close (and) narrow as though he were ascending 
upwards. Thus does Allah lay uncleanness on those who do not 
believe. 126 And this is the path of jour Lord, (a) straight (path). 
Indeed We have made the messages clear for a people who are 
mindful. 127 Theirs is the abode of peace with their Lord, and He is 
their Friend because of what they do. 

128 And on the day when He will gather them all together: 
O assembly of jinn, e you took away a great part of the people. And 



a (122) These words explain what is meant by the raising of the dead to life 
through the prophets. Through the Quran the dead were raised to life and given a 
light by which they showed the way to others. The concluding words of the verse 
show that, despite witnessing this great transformation, the leaders of mischief went 
on opposing the Truth as if it were a good deed. 

b (125) The concluding words of the verse show that uncleanness of the 
heart, which makes a person's breast close and narrow, as though he were ascen- 
ding upwards, is the result of a man's own disbelief and rejection of the truth. 

c (128-1) The word jinn is derived from janna, meaning he covered or 
concealed or hid ox protected. The class of beings that goes under this name stands 
in the Quran for the spirits of evil or the beings that invite man to evil, as opposed

their friends from among the people will say: Our Lord, some of 
us profited by others and we have reached our appointed term 
which You appointed for us. He will say: The Fire is your abode 
— you shall abide in it, except as Allah please." Surely your Lord 
is Wise, Knowing. 129 And thus do We make some of the wrong- 
doers to befriend others on account of what they earn. 

Section 16: Evils of Idolatry 

130 O community of jinn and people, did not messengers come 
to you from among you, relating to you My messages and warning 
you of the meeting of this day of yours? They will say: We bear 
witness against ourselves. And this world's life deceived them, 
and they will bear witness against themselves that they were 
disbelievers. 131 This is because your Lord would not destroy towns 
unjustly while their people are negligent. c 132 And for all are 
degrees according to their doings. And your Lord is not heedless 
of what they do. 133 And your Lord is the Self-sufficient One, the 
Lord of mercy. If He please, He may remove you, and make whom 



to the angels, who invite him to good, both being alike invisible to the human eye. 
But there is a wider use of the word in Arabic literature as well as in the Quran. 
One signification of the word is explained under 72:1. But the word is also 
applied in the Quran to powerful leaders who, through their importance and 
detachment from the masses, do not mix freely with them, so they remain distant 
or "hidden from their eyes". Verses 129-131 show that by the jinn here are meant 
the human leaders of evil. 

a (128-2) The words except as Allah please indicate that those in hell shall 
after all be delivered from it. 

b (130) By calling the jinn and people a single community, the Quran has 
made it clear that the jinn and the people spoken of here are not two different 
classes of beings. Again, the jinn and the people are told that messengers had 
come to them from among them, i.e. from among jinn and people. But as the only 
messengers spoken of in the Quran and other reliable histories of prophets are 
those who belong to mankind, it follows that the jinn spoken of here belong to 
mankind, and not to any other class of creation. 

c (131) That is, while the reminder and the warning had not yet come to 
them. Or, the words mean that it is not for negligence that nations are destroyed; it 
is only when they become wrongdoers and spread mischief in the world that they 
are overtaken by punishment in this life. 



184 6. CATTLE -6:134 

He pleases successors after you, just as He raised you up from the 
offspring of other people. 134 Surely what you are promised will 
come to pass, and you cannot escape (it). i 3s Say: My people, act 
according to your ability, I too am acting; so you will soon come 
to know for whom is the (good) end of the abode. Surely the 
wrongdoers will not succeed. 

136 And they set apart a portion for Allah out of what He has 
created of crops and cattle, and say: This is for Allah — so they 
assert — and this for our associate-gods. Then that which is for 
their associate-gods does not reach Allah, and that which is for 
Allah reaches their associate-gods. Evil is what they judge. " 
137 And thus their associate-gods have made it seem good to many 
idolaters the killing of their children, that they may cause them to 
perish and obscure for them their religion. And if Allah had 
pleased, they would not have done it, so leave them alone with 
what they forge. 

138 And they say: Such and such cattle and crops are prohi- 
bited — none shall eat them except such as we please — so they 
assert — and cattle whose backs are forbidden, and cattle on 
which they would not mention Allah's name c — forging a lie 
against Him. He will recompense them for what they forge. 
i 39 And they say: What is in the wombs of such and such cattle is 
reserved for our males, and forbidden to our wives, and if it be 



a (136) It was a custom among the Arab idolaters to set apart certain portions 
of the produce of their fields and their cattle, one portion for Allah and another 
portion for the idols. The portion for idols was always applied to their use, but the 
portion set apart for Allah, though ordinarily spent to feed the poor and the needy, 
was in certain cases diverted to the use of the idols. The portion for the idols was 
handed over to the priests. 

b (137) This refers to the practice of killing or burying alive the female 
children, and also to the human sacrifices to idols, as they sometimes vowed that, 
if they had a number of sons, they would sacrifice one of them to an idol. By 
introducing these superstitious and evil customs they were making confused and 
obscure the true religion — the religion of the service of One God. 

c (138) That is, such as were sacrificed in the name of idols. All these along 
with what is said in the next two verses are denounced as being idolatrous prac- 
tices.

stillborn, they are partners in it. He will reward them for their (false) 
attribution. Surely He is Wise, Knowing. 140 They are losers indeed 
who kill their children foolishly without knowledge, and forbid 
what Allah has provided for them, forging a lie against Allah. They 
indeed go astray, and are not guided. 

Section 17: Idolaters' Self-imposed Prohibitions 

141 And He it is Who produces gardens, trellised and 
untrellised, and palms and seed-produce of which the fruits are of 
various sorts, and olives and pomegranates like and unlike. Eat of 
its fruit when it bears fruit, and pay the due of it on the day of its 
reaping, and do not be extravagant. Surely He does not love the 
extravagant; 142 and of the cattle (He has created) some for burden 
and some for slaughter. Eat of what Allah has given you and do 
not follow the footsteps of the devil. Surely he is your open enemy 

— 143 eight in pairs — of the sheep two and of the goats two. Say: 
Has He forbidden the two males or the two females or what the 
wombs of the two females contain? Inform me with knowledge, if 
you are truthful;" 144 and of the camels two and of the cows two. 
Say: Has He forbidden the two males or the two females or what 
the wombs of the two females contain? Or were you witnesses 
when Allah enjoined you this? Who is then more unjust than he 
who forges a lie against Allah to lead people astray without know- 
ledge? Surely Allah does not guide the wrongdoing people. 

Section 18: Prohibited Foods 

145 Say: I do not find in what is revealed to me anything 
forbidden for an eater to eat of, except if it is what dies of itself, or 
blood poured forth, or flesh of swine — for that surely is unclean 

— or what is a transgression, other than the name of Allah having 
been invoked on it. But whoever is driven by necessity, not desiring 



a (143) The Arabs considered those animals which were otherwise lawful 
for them to be unlawful in particular cases. These practices, which were all super- 
stitious, resulting from idol-worship, are here condemned. 

b (145) The reason for the prohibition of what dies of itself and blood and

nor exceeding the limit, then surely jour Lord is Forgiving, 
Merciful. 146 And to those who are Jews We forbade every animal 
having claws, and We forbade them the fat of oxen and sheep, 
except such as was on their backs or the entrails or what was 
mixed with bones. This was a punishment We gave them on 
account of their rebellion, and We are surely Truthful. 147 But if 
they reject you, then say: Your Lord is the Lord of all-encompass- 
ing mercy; and His punishment cannot be averted from the guilty 
people. 

148 Those who set up partners (with Allah) say: If Allah 
pleased we would not have set up partners (with Him) nor our 
fathers, nor would we have made anything unlawful. Thus did 
those before them reject (the truth) until they tasted Our punish- 
ment. Say: Have you any knowledge so you would bring it forth 
to us? You only follow a conjecture and you only tell lies. 149 Say: 
Then Allah's is the conclusive argument; so if He had pleased, He 
would have guided you all. i 50 Say: Bring your witnesses who 
bear witness that Allah forbade this. If they bear witness, then do 
not bear witness with them. And do not follow the low desires of 



swine's flesh is that these things are physically unclean, while the reason for the 
prohibition of animals on which other than Allah's name is invoked is that all 
things are to be avoided which are in any way associated with idolatry. 

a (147) The all-encompassing mercy of Allah is mentioned even in speaking 
of those who rejected the Holy Prophet. It was because of the mercy of Allah that 
the disbelievers were not destroyed immediately; but as punishing the "guilty" is 
in itself a mercy towards the weak and the oppressed, they are warned that they 
will not escape punishment if they persist in their evil ways. 

b (149) The previous verse records the statement of the disbelievers: "If 
Allah pleased we would not have set up partners with Him". The reply is that 
Allah reveals His will through His chosen messengers, so bring forth any Divine 
revelation that you possess sanctioning idolatry. The argument is here carried on 
further. Allah does not mislead people, but, in fact, He sends His prophets to 
guide them into the right path. His pleasure is therefore that everyone should walk 
in the right path and serve only one Master. That is the conclusive argument against 
the false assertion of the idolaters. The guidance of Allah is, moreover, brought 
through prophets, and people are never compelled to accept the right way; much 
less could they be compelled to follow the wrong course. Man was created with a 
will free within certain limits to act as he pleases.

and do not follow (other) ways, for they will lead you away from

155 And this is a Book We have revealed, full of blessings; so 
follow it and keep your duty that mercy may be shown to you, 
156 in case you say that the Book was revealed only to two parties 



a (152-1) That is, unless you do it with the object of improving it or making 
it profitable. Wages of the guardian may be paid from it, for which see 4:6. 

b (152-2) Islam requires a person to be so upright as not to be led away by 
the ties of relationship. Truth is not to be sacrificed to any interest but every interest 
must be sacrificed to truth. 

c (154) By all things are meant all those things needed for the guidance of 
the Israelites.

before us and we were truly unaware of what they read," 157 or, you 
say: If the Book had been revealed to us, we would have been 
better guided than they. So indeed clear proof has come to you 
from your Lord, and guidance and mercy. Who is then more 
unjust than he who rejects Allah's messages and turns away from 
them? We reward those who turn away from Our messages with 
an evil punishment because they turned away. 

158 They only wait that the angels should come to them, or 
that your Lord should come,' or that some of the signs of your 
Lord should come. On the day when some of the signs of your 
Lord come, its faith will not benefit a soul which did not believe 
before, nor earned good through its faith.^ Say: Wait; we too are 
waiting. 159 As for those who split up their religion and became 
sects, you have no concern with them. Their affair is only with 
Allah, then He will inform them of what they did. 160 Whoever 
brings a good deed will have tenfold like it, and whoever brings 
an evil deed, will be recompensed only with the like of it, and they 
shall not be wronged. 



a (156) As in Arabia there lived only the Jews and the Christians besides the 
idolaters, the Arabs spoke of only two parties to whom the Book was given. 

b (158-1) For a similar expression see 2:210. Also v. Ill and note. Similar 
words occur also in 16:33: "They only wait that the angels should come to them 
or that your Lord's command should come to pass". Here the words are that your 
Lord should come. Thus the coming of the Lord carries the same significance as 
the coming to pass of His command, or the execution of His decree, i.e. the final 
doom of the opponents. The coming of the angels stands for the smaller visita- 
tions or distresses the opponents witnessed in the battles which they fought to 
annihilate Islam, in which the coming of angels is spoken of; see 3:125-126, 8:9. 

c (158-2) The only time when faith does not benefit a soul is the approach of 
death, and hence I am of opinion that by "some of the signs of your Lord" are 
meant clear signs of approach of death. A person's death is in one sense also his 
resurrection: "Whoever dies, his resurrection comes to pass" (Mishkat, 26:6). 

d (160) No other sacred book gives such prominence to the quality of mercy 
in the Divine Being. While evil must have its evil consequence, it is only its like, 
but virtue brings a tenfold reward. According to a saying of the Holy Prophet, evil 
is pardoned or recompensed with its like, while good brings from a tenfold to a 
seven-hundredfold reward (Bukhari, 81:33). Thus the verse mentions only the 
maximum punishment of evil and the minimum reward of good. 



6:161' THE GOAL FOR THE FAITHFUL 1 89 

161 Say: As for me, my Lord has guided me to the right path 
— a right religion, the faith of Abraham, the upright one, and he 
was not of those who set up partners (with Allah). 162 Say: My 
prayer and my sacrifice and my life and my death are surely for 
Allah, the Lord of the worlds — 163 no partner has He. And this am 
I commanded, and I am the first of those who submit." 164 Say: 
Shall I seek a Lord other than Allah, while He is the Lord of all 
things? And no soul earns (evil) but against itself. Nor does a 
bearer of burden bear another's burden. Then to your Lord is 
your return, so He will inform you of that in which you differed. 
i 65 And He it is Who has made you successors in the land and 
exalted some of you in rank above others, that He may try you by 
what He has given you. Surely your Lord is Quick in retribution, 
and He is surely the Forgiving, the Merciful. e 



a (163) The idea of entire submission to the Divine Being conveyed in the 
word Islam finds its perfect manifestation in the Holy Prophet, who is the first of 
the Muslims. Above even the noblest object that a person can set for himself stands 
the love of the Divine Being. It is the highest goal of human life, and every Muslim 
is taught to set that goal before himself. 

b (164) In these words the Christian doctrine of atonement is rejected by the 
Quran. Elsewhere we have: "That no bearer of burden bears another's burden, and 
that man can have nothing but what he strives for" (53:38-39). Every person who 
is born is called a bearer of burden, not because he is a sinner, but because he 
starts life with certain responsibilities of his own. 

c (165) With the highest goal of life before them, Muslims are now told that 
they were going to be made rulers in the land. Their exaltation above others, how- 
ever, was not due to their wealth or to their political power but simply to the fact 
that they submitted themselves to God, that their prayers and their sacrifices were 
not for their nation or their country but for God, Who was the Rabb, the Nourisher 
to perfection, of the whole of humanity. Hence they were a people who had the 
betterment of the whole of humanity in view. But even they are told, in the con- 
cluding words of the verse, that if they fall off and follow evil ways they will be 
requited, though the forgiveness and mercy of the Divine Being will ultimately 
take them by the hand. 



Chapter 7 
Ai-A'raf The Elevated Places 

The title of this chapter is taken from the mention of The Elevated Places (v. 
46) on which stand the perfect righteous servants of Allah. The main theme 
of this chapter is the truth of Divine revelation. It illustrates this by referring 
to the histories of several prophets, warning that the opponents of the Holy 
Prophet would meet the same fate as the opponents of the earlier prophets if 
they did not mend their ways. The chapter goes on to relate the history of 
Moses, as the Prophet Muhammad appeared in the likeness of Moses accord- 
ing to prophecies in the Torah. Towards the end, it gives the essence of the 
last and present chapter. This chapter was revealed at Makkah, just prior to 
the Emigration of the Holy Prophet. 



Section 1: Opponents' Doom 

In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful. 

1 I, Allah, am the Best Knower, the Truthful. a 2 A Book 
revealed to you — so let there be no worry in your heart con- 
cerning it — that you may warn with it, and a Reminder to the 
believers. c 3 Follow what has been revealed to you from your Lord 
and do not follow besides Him any guardians; little mindful are 
you! 

4 And how many a town have We destroyed! So Our punish- 
ment came to it by night or while they slept at midday. 5 Yet their 



a (1) Of the four letters alif, lam, mim, and sad, the first three are the same as 
at the commencement of ch. 2, for which see 2:1 footnote; while sad stands for 
Sadiq, meaning Truthful, Whose promise would not fail. 

b (2-1) This parenthetical passage is introduced to console the Holy Prophet, 
who at this time was encountering the greatest opposition and was surrounded by 
difficulties on all sides. 

c (2-2) The Quran is called a reminder because, being in consonance with 
human nature, it is a reminder of what is imprinted on human nature. It may, how- 
ever, have the alternative meaning of honour or eminence, for which see 2: 1 52.

cry, when Our punishment came to them, was nothing but that 
they said: Surely we were wrongdoers. 6 Then certainly We shall 
question those to whom messengers were sent, and We shall ques- 
tion the messengers, 7 then surely We shall recount to them with 
knowledge, and We are never absent. 

8 And the judging on that day will be just; so as for those 
whose good deeds are heavy, they are the successful. 9 And as for 
those whose good deeds are light, those are they who ruined their 
souls because they disbelieved in Our messages. 10 And certainly 
We established you in the earth and made in it means of livelihood 
for you; little thanks you give! 

Section 2: The Devil's Opposition to Man 

11 And We indeed created you, then We fashioned you, then 
We said to the angels: Be submissive to Adam. So they sub- 
mitted, but not IblTs; he was not of those who submitted. 12 He 
said: What hindered you from submitting when I commanded 
you? He said: I am better than he; You have created me of fire, 
while him You did create of dust. c 13 He said: Then get forth from 
this (state), for it is not for you to behave proudly in it. Go forth, 



a (6) Those to whom messengers were sent will be questioned as to how 
they treated the messengers, and the latter as to how they were received. 

b (11) That what is stated here of Adam is true of all mankind is made clear 
by the opening words of this verse. Human beings are created first, then fashion- 
ed, then the order is given to the angels to make submission to Adam, who in this 
sense typifies a human being. Thus the angels are really required to make sub- 
mission to every human being. 

c (12) Not only is Adam created from dust, but all human beings are spoken 
of as being similarly created; see 3:59 footnote, and see also 18:37, 22:5 and 
30:20. As a contrast to man's creation from dust, the devil claims to have been 
created from fire. There may be a reference here to the nature of the temperaments 
of the two classes, human beings and devils. The Quran says elsewhere: "Man is 
created of haste" (21:37), which means that he is hasty. In like manner the devil's 
creation of fire may mean that he is made of a fiery temperament, while the 
perfect man is humble and meek, being created of dust, which stands for humility 
and meekness. Elsewhere it is stated that the jinn were created of fire (15:27), and 
also that Iblls was one of the jinn (18:50). 



192 7. THE ELEVATED PLACES • 7 : 14 

therefore, surely you are a degraded one. 14 He said: Grant me 
respite till the day when they are raised." 15 He said: Surely jou are 
granted respite. 

16 He said: As You have judged me to be in error, I will 
certainly lie in wait for them in Your straight path, 17 then I shall 
certainly come upon them from in front of them and from behind 
them, and from their right and from their left; and You will not 
find most of them thankful. 18 He said: Get out of it, despised, 
driven away. Whoever of them will follow you, I will certainly fill 
hell with you all. 

19 And (We said): O Adam, dwell you and jour wife in the 
garden, and eat from wherever you wish, but do not go near this 
tree or you would be from among the unjust. 20 But the devil made 
an evil suggestion to them that he might make manifest to them 
their shame that had been hidden from them,' and he said: Your 
Lord has only forbidden you this tree that you may not become 
angels or become immortals. 21 And he swore to them both: Surely 
I am a sincere adviser to you — 22 thus he caused them to fall by 
deceit. So when they had tasted of the tree, their shame became 
manifest to them, and they both began to cover themselves with 
the leaves of the garden. c And their Lord called to them: Did I not 
forbid you that tree, and say to you that the devil is surely your 
open enemy? 23 They said: Our Lord, we have wronged ourselves; 



a (14) The devil's grip continues only so long as man is not spiritually raised 
to life. The raising here stands for the spiritual resurrection of man. If the final 
Resurrection is meant, the significance would be that the devil would mislead man 
so long as man lives on this earth. 

b (20) The devil's suggestions always lead man to the disclosure of his 
shame. 

c (22) The covering with the leaves of the garden is the desire to make up by 
human effort any fault that may have been committed. The clothing that guards 
against evil, which is spoken of in v. 26 as being the best clothing, explains the 
meaning of covering here. Divine revelation points out to man the true way, 
enabling him to cover himself or guard himself against evil. And, further, the state- 
ment in v. 27, pulling off from them both their clothing that he might show them 
their shame shows that covering with the leaves of the garden is an allegorical 
statement; see v. 27 footnote 1. 



7 : 24 • WARNING AGAINST THE DEVIL'S INSINUATIONS 1 93 

and if You do not forgive us and have mercy on us, we shall 
certainly be from among the losers. 24 He said: Go forth — some 
of you are enemies of others. And there is for you in the earth an 
abode and a provision for a time. 25 He said: In it shall you live, 
and in it shall you die, and from it shall you be raised. 

Section 3: Warning against the Devil's Insinuations 

26 O children of Adam, We have indeed sent down to you 
clothing to cover your shame and (clothing) for beauty; and 
clothing that guards against evil — that is the best." This is of the 
messages of Allah that they may be mindful. 27 children of 
Adam, do not let the devil seduce you, as he expelled your parents 
from the garden, pulling off from them both their clothing that he 
might show them their shame. He surely sees you, he as well as 
his company, from where you do not see them. Surely We have 
made the devils to be the friends of those who do not believe/ 

28 And when they commit an indecency they say: We found 
our fathers doing this, and Allah has commanded us to do it. Say: 
Surely Allah does not command indecency. Do you say of Allah 
what you do not know? 29 Say: My Lord commands (the doing of) 
justice. And set upright your faces at every time of prayer and call 
on Him, being sincere to Him in obedience. As He brought you 



a (26) Clothing at first simply served to cover shame; with further progress 
people sought to embellish their persons with it; but there is yet a third kind of 
clothing, says the Quran, which is the best, and that is the clothing of piety, 
literally the clothing that guards one against evil. It indicates a further step in the 
progress of man, for virtue is an embellishment of the mind, and when man has 
seen the good of embellishing his person, he will soon be aware of the necessity 
of embellishing his mind. 

b (27-1) That the clothing for the body is not meant here is clear from the 
fact that all men and women are warned against a similar attack of the devil. As to 
the clothing of which Adam was divested, there remains no doubt, when it is seen 
that the devil tries to divest every child of Adam of the same clothing: it is the 
clothing that guards against evil. 

c (27-2) It is because they do not believe in the Truth that the devils are 
made their friends. Those who sever their connection with the Source of purity 
must fall into impurity. 



194 7. THE ELEVATED PLACES • 7 : 30 

into being, so shall you return. 30 Some has He guided, and others 
— error is justly their due." Surely they took the devils for friends 
instead of Allah, and they think that they are rightly guided. 
31 children of Adam, attend to your adornment at every time of 
prayer, and eat and drink and do not be extravagant; surely He 
does not love the extravagant. 

Section 4: Messengers sent for Uplift of Humanity 

32 Say: Who has forbidden the adornment of Allah, c which 
He has brought forth for His servants, and the good provisions? 
Say: These are for the believers in the life of this world, purely 
(theirs) on the day of Resurrection. Thus do We make the mess- 
ages clear for a people who know. 33 Say: My Lord forbids only 
indecencies, such of them as are apparent and such as are con- 
cealed, and sin and unjust rebellion, and that you set up with Allah 
partners for which He has sent down no authority, and that you 
say of Allah what you do not know. 

34 And every nation has a term; so when its term comes they 
cannot postpone it an hour, nor can they bring it forward. 
35 children of Adam, if messengers come to you from among 
you relating to you My messages, then whoever guards against evil 
and acts aright — they shall have no fear, nor shall they grieve. 



a (30) Error is justly their due because they have taken the devils for their 
friends. Whoever continues to follow the devil must surely remain in error. 

b (31) Attending to one's adornment carries a double significance here. It 
requires adorning oneself physically, i.e. being clean and clothed appropriately for 
prayer, especially for the Friday and 'Id gatherings. But what is specially aimed at 
is adornment in a spiritual sense. A Muslim must attend to inner beautification, 
for prayer is really meant as an aid to the beauty of the soul. He must come to 
prayer with a heart free from all impurities and full of the highest aspirations and 
noblest sentiments. 

c (32-1) By the adornment of Allah is meant the adornment which Allah has 
made lawful for people to avail themselves of. 

d (32-2) In the life of this world the believer and the disbeliever equally 
benefit by the good things, but in the life after death all good shall be exclusively 
for those who have accepted and acted on the right principles. 



7:36' MESSENGERS SENT FOR UPLIFT OF HUMANITY 1 95 

36 And those who reject Our messages and turn away from them 
haughtily — these are the companions of the Fire; they shall abide 
in it. 

37 Who is then more unjust than he who forges a lie against 
Allah or rejects His messages? These — their portion of the Book 
shall reach them; a until when Our messengers come to them caus- 
ing them to die, they say: Where are those you used to call upon 
besides Allah? They would say: They are gone away from us. And 
they shall bear witness against themselves that they were disbelie- 
vers. 38 He will say: Enter into the Fire among the nations of jinn 
and people that have passed away before you. Every time a nation 
enters, it curses its sister; until when they all follow one another 
into it, the last of them will say with regard to the first of them: c 
Our Lord, these led us astray, so give them a double punishment 
of the Fire. He will say: Each one has double but you do not 
know. 39 And the first of them will say to the last of them: You 
have no preference over us, so taste the punishment for what you 
earned. 

Section 5: Those who accept the Message 

40 Those who reject Our messages and turn away from them 
haughtily, the doors of heaven will not be opened for them, nor 
will they enter the Garden until the camel pass through the eye of 
the needle. And thus do We reward the guilty. 41 They shall have a 



a (37) That is, the punishment promised in the Book will overtake them. 

b (38-1) By the sister nation is meant the nation which resembles it in its 
deeds. 

c (38-2) By the last and Has first are meant here the common people and the 
leaders, because, though the words would bear both interpretations, i.e. the last 
and the first in time or the last and the first in position, the latter significance is 
corroborated by similar expressions in several other places, such as 2:166, 14:21, 
34:31-33,40:47, etc. 

d (38-3) The common people would desire that the leaders should suffer a 
double torment, for their own sins as well as for having misled others. They are 
told that if the leaders were guilty of misleading them, they themselves deserved a 
double punishment for having blindly followed the leaders.

bed of hell and over them coverings (of it). And thus do We 
recompense the wrongdoers. 42 And as for those who believe and 
do good — We do not impose on any soul a duty beyond its scope 
— they are the owners of the Garden; in it they abide. 43 And We 
shall remove whatever of bitterness is in their hearts — rivers 
flow beneath them. And they say: All praise is due to Allah, Who 
guided us to this! And we would not have found the way if Allah 
had not guided us. Certainly the messengers of our Lord brought 
the truth. And it will be cried out to them: This is the Garden 
which you are made to inherit for what you did. 

44 And the owners of the Garden call out to the companions 
of the Fire: We have found what our Lord promised us to be true; 
have you, too, found what your Lord promised to be true? They will 
say: Yes. Then a crier will cry out among them: The curse of Allah 
is on the wrongdoers, 45 who hinder (people) from Allah's way and 
seek to make it crooked, " and they are disbelievers in the Here- 
after. 46 And between them is a veil. And on the Elevated Places 
are men who know all by their marks.' And they call out to the 
owners of the Garden: Peace be on you! They have not yet entered 
it, though they hope.'' 47 And when their eyes are turned towards 
the companions of the Fire, they say: Our Lord, do not place us 
with the unjust people/ 



a (45) By seeking to make Allah's way crooked is meant that they suggest 
doubts regarding the Truth. 

b (46-1) The veil which here separates the wicked from the righteous and on 
account of which the former fail to see the bliss which the latter enjoy will assume 
a perceptible form in the next life. Thus it is not distance that separates heaven 
from hell but only a veil, and they hear and even see one another. 

c (46-2) The men spoken of here as being on the elevated places (the title of 
this chapter, Al-A 'raf) are the same righteous servants of Allah who are distinctly 
mentioned in 56:10-11: "And the foremost are the foremost — these are drawn 
near to Allah". Besides this, the prophets are again and again spoken of as a class 
by themselves, being witnesses over their people. 

d (46-3) They are, as it were, standing at the door of the Garden, ready to 
enter it. 

e (47) Thus do pray those who hope to enter paradise. 



7 : 48 • HELPLESSNESS OF OPPONENTS 197 

Section 6: Helplessness of Opponents 

48 And the owners of the Elevated Places call out to men 
whom they recognize by their marks, saying: Of no avail were to 
you your amassings a and your arrogance. 49 Are these they about 
whom you swore that Allah would not bestow mercy on them? 
Enter the Garden; you have no fear, nor shall you grieve. 50 And 
the companions of the Fire call out to the owners of the Garden: 
Pour on us some water or some of what Allah has provided for 
you. They say: Surely Allah has forbidden them both to the 
disbelievers, 51 who take their religion for an idle sport and a play, 
and this world's life deceives them. So this day We shall forsake 
them, as they neglected the meeting of this day of theirs, and as 
they denied Our messages. 

52 And certainly We have brought them a Book which We 
make clear with knowledge, a guidance and a mercy for a people 
who believe. 53 Do they wait only for its final sequel? On the day 
when its final sequel comes, those who neglected it before will say: 
Indeed the messengers of our Lord brought the truth. Are there 
any intercessors on our behalf so that they should intercede for us? 
Or could we be sent back so that we should do (deeds) other than 
those which we did? Indeed they have lost their souls, and what 
they forged has failed them. 

Section 7: The Righteous will prosper 

54 Surely your Lord is Allah, Who created the heavens and 
the earth in six periods/ and He is established on the Throne 



a (48) The word used may mean either your amassing worldly wealth, or it 
may mean your multitude or strength in numbers. 

b (53) By final sequel is meant the ultimate state of the perfect manifestation 
of truth by the fulfilment of the prophecies, the end ox the ultimate consequence. 

c (54-1) The word yaum means not only day but also a period, whatever 
period it may be. The six periods of time in which the heavens and the earth are 
created refer in fact to the six stages in which they have grown to their present 
condition. In the case of the earth these six stages are detailed in 41:9-10. 



198 7. THE ELEVATED PLACES • 7 : 55 

of Power." He makes the night cover the day, which it pursues 
incessantly. And (He created) the sun and the moon and the stars, 
made subservient by His command. Surely His is the creation and 
the command. Blessed is Allah, the Lord of the worlds! 55 Call on 
your Lord humbly and in secret. Surely He does not love the 
transgressors. 56 And do not make mischief in the earth after its 
reformation, and call on Him, fearing and hoping. Surely the mercy 
of Allah is near to the doers of good.' 

57 And He it is Who sends forth the winds bearing good news 
before His mercy; till, when they bear a laden cloud, We drive it 
to a dead land, then We send down water on it, then bring forth 
thereby fruits of all kinds. Thus do We bring forth the dead that 
you may be mindful/ 58 And the good land — its vegetation comes 



a (54-2) The true significance of the word 'arsh is power or control of the 
creation. It is not a physical throne for sitting on. The phrase "He is established 
on the Throne of Power ( 'arsh)" is used in the Quran here and on six other occa- 
sions, viz., in 10:3, 13:2, 20:5, 25:59, 32:4 and 57:4. It is invariably used after 
mentioning the creation of the heavens and the earth and in relation to the Divine 
control of His creation and the law and order to which the universe is made to 
submit by its great Author, as shown by the words that follow here, His is the 
creation and the command. The meaning is that after creating the universe, God 
has not left it to run its course independently of Him, but He it is Whose command 
holds sway and Who regulates the affairs as He has planned them. 

b (54-3) In the words Rabh al- 'alamin ("Lord of the worlds") there is also a 
deeper reference to the spiritual evolution of man which is being worked out 
under the Divine plan, and the 'arsh is mentioned specially in this connection, as 
man's perfection does not consist in the working of the material laws which 
prevail in the universe but in the spiritual laws which are needed for his per- 
fection. In 40:15 the Lord of the 'arsh is clearly stated to be the Sender of revela- 
tion to man to bring about his spiritual perfection. In 40:7 it is added: "Those who 
bear the 'arsh and those around it celebrate the praise of their Lord and believe in 
Him and ask protection for those who believe". The bearers of the 'arsh or the 
Throne of Power are, in fact, the bearers of the Divine message. 

c (56) The feeling which should be entertained towards Allah should be a 
combination of fear and hope, of awe as well as love, because the fear of His dis- 
pleasure ennobles the mind no less than the hope of His mercy. 

d (57-1) His mercy represents the rain in the physical world. 

e (57-2) The bringing forth of the spiritually dead to life through the revela- 
tion of the Quran is always likened to the bringing of the dead earth to life by rain. 



7:59* NOAH 199 

forth (abundantly) by the permission of its Lord. And that which is 
inferior — (its vegetation) comes forth but scantily. Thus do We 
repeat the messages for a people who give thanks. a 

Section 8: Noah 

59 Certainly We sent Noah to his people, so he said: My 
people, serve Allah, you have no god other than Him. Indeed I 
fear for you the punishment of a grievous day. 60 The chiefs of his 
people said: Surely we see you in clear error. 61 He said: My people, 
there is no error in me, but I am a messenger from the Lord of the 
worlds. 62 I deliver to you the messages of my Lord, and I offer 
you good advice, and I know from Allah what you do not know. 
63 Do you wonder that a reminder has come to you from your Lord 
through a man from among you, that he may warn you and that 
you may guard against evil, and that mercy may be shown to you? 

64 But they called him a liar, so We delivered him and those 
with him in the ark, and We drowned those who rejected Our 
messages. Surely they were a blind people! c 



The wind bearing the good news was the movement towards Islam, which was 
daily becoming more and more powerful. 

a (58) Revelation is here likened to the rain and the good or bad nature of 
man to good or inferior land. If some people do not benefit by the revelation, it is 
just as some lands do not benefit by rain. 

b (59) Having warned the opponents of the evil consequences of their oppo- 
sition to the Holy Prophet, several illustrations are now given from sacred history, 
showing how those people were dealt with who refused to listen to the voice of 
the warners. The object is not to narrate history as such, but to bring out common 
characteristics of the histories of different nations, to mention incidents which 
contain prophetical allusion to the Holy Prophet's life and to illustrate the general 
warnings made regarding the ultimate consequences of the rejection of Truth. The 
Quran relates the broad facts that every prophet preached Divine Unity, every 
prophet laid stress on the doing of good, every prophet was received with severe 
opposition, and that every prophet ultimately succeeded in establishing the truth. 

c (64) See further 1 1 :37 — 48 and 23:27-29. The Quran does not support the 
idea of a world deluge, for it states here that Noah was sent only to his people, not 
to all nations. Only the people to whom Noah was sent called him a liar, and only 
those were drowned who rejected the message of Allah delivered through Noah.

Section 9: Hod 

65 And to Ad (We sent) their brother Hud." He said: My 
people, serve Allah, you have no god other than Him. Will you 
not then guard against evil? 66 The chiefs of those who disbelieved 
from among his people said: Certainly we see you in folly, and we 
certainly think you to be a liar. 67 He said: My people, there is no 
folly in me, but I am a messenger of the Lord of the worlds. 
68 I deliver to you the messages of my Lord and I am a faithful 
adviser to you. 69 Do you wonder that a reminder has come to you 
from your Lord through a man from among you that he may warn 
you? And remember when He made you successors after Noah's 
people and increased you in excellence of make. So remember 
the bounties of Allah, that you may be successful. 70 They said: 
Have you come to us that we may serve Allah alone, and give up 
what our fathers used to serve? Then bring us what you threaten us 
with, if you are truthful. 71 He said: Indeed uncleanness and wrath 
from your Lord have come upon you. Do you dispute with me 
about names which you and your fathers have named? c Allah has 
not sent any authority for them. So wait; I too am waiting along 
with you. 

72 So We delivered him and those with him by mercy from 
Us, and We cut off the roots of those who rejected Our messages 
and were not believers. 



a (65) Ad was the grandson of Aram (mentioned in 89:7), who was a grand- 
son of Noah, and the tribe of Ad spoken of here is called the first Ad (53:50), as 
distinguished from the tribe of Thamud, which is called the second Ad. This tribe 
lived in the desert of al-Ahqaf (46:21) which is marked on the maps of Arabia and 
extends from Oman to Hadramaut. 

The male member of a tribe is generally spoken of as their brother, as here 
HOd is called. The prophet Hud is the Eber of the Bible, because Hud is said to be 
the grandson of Arphaxad, the grandson of Noah. Compare Genesis 10:24 for 
Eber's genealogy. 

b (69) By making them khulafa ' or successors is meant that they were made 
a ruling nation and possessors of a vast kingdom. 

c (71) The reference here is to their deities. 

d (72) They were destroyed by a storm (69:7). 



7 : 73 • SALIH AND LOT 201 

Section 10: Salih and Lot 

73 And to Thamud (We sent) their brother Salih." He said: 
My people, serve Allah, you have no god other than Him. Clear 
proof has indeed come to you from your Lord. This is Allah's she- 
camel — a sign for you — so leave her alone to pasture in Allah's 
earth, and do her no harm or a painful punishment will afflict you. 
74 And remember when He made you successors after Ad and 
settled you in the land — you make mansions on its plains and 
carve out houses in the mountains. So remember Allah's bounties 
and do not act corruptly in the land, making mischief. 75 The arro- 
gant chiefs of his people said to those who were weak, to those 
who believed from among them: Do you know that Salih is one 
sent by his Lord? They said: Surely we are believers in that with 
which he has been sent. 76 Those who were arrogant said: Surely 
we are disbelievers in what you believe. 

77 Then they hamstrung the she-camel and revolted against 
their Lord's commandment, and said: Salih, bring us what you 
threaten us with, if you are one of the messengers. 78 So the earth- 
quake seized them, and they were motionless bodies in their abodes. 
79 So he turned away from them and said: My people, indeed I 
delivered to you the message of my Lord and gave you good advice, 
but you do not love good advisers. c 

80 And (We sent) Lot, when he said to his people: Do you 



a (73-1) Ad and Thamud, though two nearly related tribes, were separated 
both as regards time and place. Thamud is known after a grandson of Aram, the 
grandson of Noah. Historical traces of it are met with in Ptolemy. The tribe flouri- 
shed more than two hundred years after Ad, and occupied the territory known as 
al-Hijr (15:80), and the plain known by the name of Wadi-1-Qura, which forms 
the southern boundary of Syria and the northern one of Arabia. Salih was a des- 
cendant in the sixth generation after Thamud. 

b (73-2) It is called Allah 's she-camel because it was given as a sign from 
Allah. It was an ordinary she-camel, which was given as a sign to a people. Their 
slaying of it was a sign that they would neither accept the truth, nor cease persecu- 
ting Salih and his followers. 

c (79) This evidently refers to the survivors from the great disaster. 

d (80) Lot is one of those prophets who have been maligned in the Bible. He

81 Surely you come to males with lust instead of females. Indeed, 
you are a people exceeding bounds. 82 And the answer of his people 
was only that they said: Turn them out of your town; surely they 
are a people who aspire to purity! 83 So We delivered him and his 
followers, except his wife — she was among those who remained 
behind. 84 And We rained upon them a rain. a See, then, what was 
the end of the guilty! 

Section 1 1 : Shuaib 

85 And to Midian (We sent) their brother Shuaib. He said: 
My people, serve Allah, you have no god other than Him. Clear 
proof indeed has come to you from your Lord, so give full measure 
and weight and do not diminish to people their things^ nor make 
mischief in the land after its reform. This is better for you, if you 
are believers. 86 Nor lie in wait on every road, threatening and 
turning away from Allah's way him who believes in Him and 
seeking to make it crooked. And remember when you were few, 
then He multiplied you, and see what was the end of the mischief- 
makers! 87 And if there are some of you who believe in what I am 
sent with, and others who do not believe, then wait patiently till 
Allah judges between us; and He is the Best of judges. 

88 The arrogant chiefs of his people said: We will certainly 
3- turn you out, Shuaib, and those who believe with you from our 
town, or you shall come back to our religion. He said: Even though 
we dislike (it)? 89 Indeed we should have forged a lie against Allah, 



was considered a righteous servant by Abraham (Genesis, 18:23), but a little 
further on in the same book we are told that Lot was guilty of incestuous inter- 
course with his daughters. The record there has evidently been manipulated. 

a (84) The punishment which overtook the people of Lot is frequently called 
rain, while in 11:82 and 15:74 stones are said to have been rained down upon 
them. See also 54:34. It was a volcanic eruption combined with an earthquake. 

b (85-1) Shuaib was a descendant of Abraham in the fifth generation. It is 
generally supposed to be another name for Jethro of the Bible (Exodus, 3:1). 

c (85-2) The injunction do not diminish to people their things stands for not 
depriving or defrauding people of their rights.

if we go back to your religion after Allah has delivered us from it. 
And it is not for us to go back to it, unless Allah our Lord please. 
Our Lord comprehends all things in His knowledge. In Allah do 
we trust. Our Lord, decide between us and our people with truth, 
and You are the Best of deciders. 90 And the chiefs of his people, 
who disbelieved, said: If you follow Shuaib, you are surely losers. 

91 So the earthquake overtook them, and they were motion- 
less bodies in their homes — 92 Those who called Shuaib a liar 
were as though they had never dwelt there — those who called 
Shuaib a liar, they were the losers. 93 So he turned away from them 
and said: My people, indeed I delivered to you the messages of 
my Lord and I gave you good advice; how, then, should I be sorry 
for a disbelieving people? 

Section 12: Makkans warned of Punishment 

94 And We did not send a prophet to a town but We seized its 
people with distress and affliction that they might humble them- 
selves." 95 Then We changed the evil for good, till they became 
affluent and said: Distress and happiness did indeed touch our 
fathers. So We took them by surprise while they did not perceive. 
96 And if the people of the towns had believed and kept their duty, 
We would certainly have opened for them blessings from the 
heavens and the earth. But they rejected, so We seized them for 
what they earned. 97 Are the people of the towns, then, secure from 
Our punishment coming to them by night while they sleep? 
98 0r, are the people of the towns secure from Our punishment 
coming to them in the morning while they play? "Are they 
secure from Allah's plan? But none feels secure from Allah's plan 
except the people who perish. 



a (94) That the histories of the nations are meant as a warning to all oppo- 
nents of truth is evident. It is also plain that even afflictions and distress sent on a 
people are meant for their spiritual betterment, that they might humble themselves. 

b (98) The playing may be taken either literally or it may indicate the 
worldly engagements in which they were occupied to the utter neglect of higher 
aspirations.

Section 13: Moses sent to Pharaoh with Signs 

100 Is it not clear to those who inherit the earth after its 
(former) residents that, if We please, We would afflict them for 
their sins, and seal their hearts so they would not hear? 101 Such 
were the towns some of whose news We have related to you. And 
certainly their messengers came to them with clear arguments, but 
they would not believe what they had rejected before. Thus does 
Allah seal the hearts of the disbelievers. 102 And We did not find in 
most of them (faithfulness to) covenant; and We found most of 
them to be transgressors. 

103 Then, after them, We sent Moses " with Our messages to 
Pharaoh and his chiefs, but they disbelieved them. See, then, what 
was the end of the mischief-makers! 104 And Moses said: O Pharaoh, 
surely I am a messenger from the Lord of the worlds, i° 5 worthy of 
not saying anything about Allah except the truth. I have come to 
you indeed with clear proof from your Lord, so let the Children of 
Israel go with me. i° 6 He said: If you have come with a sign, 
produce it, if you are truthful. 107 So he threw down his staff, then 
lo! it was an obvious snake. 108 And he drew forth his hand, and lo! 
it was white to the onlookers. 



a (103) The history of Moses is here taken up in detail. The Holy Prophet 
Muhammad had more in common with Moses than with any other prophet, and he 
is called the like of Moses in the Mosaic prophecies. 

b (108) It is nowhere stated that whenever Moses threw down his rod it 
turned into a snake. Only on two occasions the rod is stated to have turned into a 
snake: (1) when Moses held communion with God before going to Pharaoh; 
(2) when he first came before Pharaoh, or when Pharaoh summoned the enchan- 
ters to his help. On the first of these occasions the rod was seen turning into a 
snake by Moses alone, when he was in a state of vision — the state in which a 
prophet is temporarily transported to a spiritual sphere. On the latter occasion 
others besides Moses witnessed the change, but it is a fact that the effect of 
inspired vision is sometimes so strong that others besides the seer partake in it. 

Whatever their real nature, these miracles of Moses were not mere play. The 
great truth underlying the rod or staff turning into a snake was that the followers 
of Moses, as represented by his rod, would prevail over their enemies; and the sig- 
nificance underlying the whitening of Moses' hand was that his arguments would 
shine forth with clearness. 



7 : 109 • PHARAOH SUMMONS ENCHANTERS 205 

Section 14: Pharaoh summons Enchanters 

109 The chiefs of Pharaoh's people said: Surely this is a 
skilful enchanter! 110 He intends to turn you out of your land. 
(Pharaoh said:) What do you advise? m They said: Put him off and 
his brother, and send heralds into the cities, 112 to bring to you 
every skilful enchanter. 

113 And the enchanters came to Pharaoh, saying: We must 
surely have a reward if we prevail. 114 He said: Yes, and you shall 
certainly be among those who are near (to me). 

115 They said: Moses, will you throw, or shall we (be the first 
to) throw? 116 He said: You throw. So when they threw, they decei- 
ved the people's eyes and overawed them, and they produced a 
mighty enchantment. 117 And We revealed to Moses: Throw down 
jour staff. Then lo! it swallowed up their lies. 118 So the truth was 
established, and what they did became null. 119 There they were 
defeated, and they went back humiliated. 

120 And the enchanters fell down prostrate — 121 They said: 
We believe in the Lord of the worlds, 122 the Lord of Moses and 
Aaron. 123 Pharaoh said: You believe in Him before I give you per- 
mission! Surely this is a plot which you have plotted in the city, to 
turn out of it its people, but you shall know! n4 I shall certainly cut 
off your hands and your feet on opposite sides, then I shall crucify 
you all together! 125 They said: Surely to our Lord do we return. 
m And you take revenge on us only because we believed in the 
messages of our Lord when they came to us. Our Lord, pour out 
on us patience and cause us to die in submission (to You)! " 



a (126) The Bible does not speak of the magicians as believing in the Divine 
mission of Moses when they were vanquished, but according to Rabbinical litera- 
ture, some Egyptians accompanied Moses when he departed from Egypt. It should 
be noted that the magicians could not have believed unless they had heard the 
arguments of Moses as to the existence of God and as to a life after death in 
which they now believed so staunchly that they were ready to sacrifice their very 
lives for their faith. It shows that Moses had explained the essential religious 
truths to the whole gathering before he showed the signs.

Section 15: Persecution of Israelites continues 

127 And the chiefs of Pharaoh's people said: Will you leave 
Moses and his people to make mischief in the land and forsake 
you and your gods? He said: We will kill their sons and spare their 
women, and surely we are dominant over them. 128 Moses said to 
his people: Ask help from Allah and be patient. Surely the land is 
Allah's — He gives it for an inheritance to such of His servants as 
He pleases. And the end is for those who keep their duty. 129 They 
said: We were persecuted before you came to us and since you 
have come to us. He said: It may be that your Lord will destroy 
your enemy and make you rulers in the land, then He will see how 
you act. a 

Section 16: Moses shows more Signs 

130 And certainly We overtook Pharaoh's people with droughts 
and shortage of fruits that they might be mindful. 131 But when 
good befell them they said: This is due to us. And when evil 
afflicted them, they attributed it to the ill-luck of Moses and those 
with him. Surely their evil fortune is only from Allah, but most of 
them do not know. 132 And they said: Whatever sign you may 
bring us to charm us with it — we shall not believe in you. 133 So 
We sent upon them widespread death, and the locusts and the lice 
and the frogs and the blood — clear signs. But they behaved 
haughtily and they were a guilty people. 

134 And when the plague fell upon them, they said: Moses, 
pray for us to your Lord as He has made promise with you. If you 
remove the plague from us, we will certainly believe in you and 
will let the Children of Israel go with you. 135 But when We re- 
moved the plague from them till a term which they should attain, 



a (129) By the land is meant the Promised Land, for it was there that Moses 
was taking them. Their being made rulers in the land was conditional upon their 
doing good; this is suggested in the concluding words of the verse. 

b (131) Their evil fortune is from Allah means that the misfortunes which 
they were made to suffer were brought about by Allah as a result of their own evil 
deeds. 



7 : 136 • MOSES SHOWS MORE SIGNS 207 

lo! they broke (their promise)." 136 So We exacted retribution from 
them and drowned them in the sea, because they rejected Our 
signs and were heedless of them. 137 And We made the people who 
were considered weak to inherit the eastern lands and the western 
ones which We had blessed. And the good word of your Lord was 
fulfilled in the Children of Israel — because of their patience. 
And We destroyed what Pharaoh and his people had produced and 
what they had built. 

138 And We took the Children of Israel across the sea. Then 
they came to a people who were devoted to their idols. They said: 
Moses, make for us a god as they have gods. e He said: Surely you 
are an ignorant people! 139 (As to) these, what they are engaged in 
shall be destroyed and what they do is futile. 140 He said: Shall I 
seek for you a god other than Allah, while He has made you excel 
(all) created things? i 41 And when We delivered you from Pharaoh's 
people, who subjected you to severe torment, killing your sons and 
sparing your women. And in it there was a great trial from your 
Lord. 

Section 17: Moses receives the Law 

142 And We appointed for Moses thirty nights, and completed 
them with ten, so the appointed time of his Lord was complete 



a (135) A reference to Exodus, ch. 8—11, will show that Pharaoh again and 
again broke his promise to let the Children of Israel go — promises which he 
made on condition that a certain affliction should be removed. 

b (137) The land that was blessed is none other than the Holy Land, for 
which a Divine promise was given to Abraham. The good word referred to here is 
that contained in Genesis 17:8. The eastern and the western lands might signify 
the eastern and the western tracts of the Holy Land, or the lands on the eastern 
and western sides of the Jordan. 

c (138) The Israelites undoubtedly came across idolatrous nations in their 
wanderings. They themselves had idolatrous leanings: "...the people gathered 
together to Aaron, and said to him, Come, make us gods that shall go before us" 
(Exodus, 32:1). Many other anecdotes show a similar tendency to idol-worship. 

rf(140) Moses' argument against idolatry is the one to which the Quran 
repeatedly calls attention, namely, that man, being as it were the lord of creation 
under God, and excelling the whole of creation, should not take objects lower 
than himself as his gods. 



208 7. THE ELEVATED PLACES • 7 : 143 

forty nights. And Moses said to his brother Aaron: Take my place 
among my people, and act well and do not follow the way of the 
mischief-makers. 143 And when Moses came at Our appointed time 
and his Lord spoke to him, he said: My Lord, show me (Yourself) 
so that I may look at You. He said: Fou cannot see Me, but look at 
the mountain; if it remains firm in its place, then will you see Me. 
So when his Lord manifested His glory to the mountain, He made 
it crumble and Moses fell down fainting." Then when he recovered, 
he said: Glory be to You! I turn to You, and I am the first of the 
believers. 144 He said: O Moses, surely I have chosen you above 
the people by My messages and My words. So take hold of what I 
give you and be of the grateful ones. 

145 And We ordained for him in the tablets admonition of 
every kind and clear explanation of all things. So take hold of 
these (teachings) with firmness and command your people to take 
hold of the best of these. I shall show you the abode of the trans- 
gressors. 146 I shall turn away from My messages those who are 
unjustly proud in the earth. And if they see every sign, they will 
not believe in it; and if they see the way of rectitude, they do not 
take it for a way; and if they see the way of error, they take it for a 
way. This is because they reject Our messages and are heedless of 
them. 147 And those who reject Our messages and the meeting of 



a (143) The words You cannot see Me negative the seeing of the Divine 
Being with the physical eye. Moses' request seems to have been based on the 
elders' demand spoken of in 2:55. I venture, however, another explanation. What 
Moses wanted to see was the great manifestation of Divine glory which was reser- 
ved for the Holy Prophet Muhammad. In fact, both Moses and Jesus were not 
equal to the task which was reserved for the Prophet Muhammad. Jesus said that 
he could not teach his followers all things, but that when the Comforter made his 
appearance he would guide them into all truth. That Moses was unequal to the 
Holy Prophet's task was clearly demonstrated by his falling down in a swoon 
when he beheld the Great Manifestation. 

b (145-1) The words admonition of every kind and explanation of all things 
cannot be taken generally, but are limited by the requirements of the time in which 
Moses appeared. 

c (145-2) The meaning is that a time will come to the Israelites when they 
will become transgressors, i.e. they will not keep the Divine commandments.

the Hereafter — their deeds are fruitless. Can they be rewarded 
except for what they do? 

Section 18: Israelites worship a Calf 

148 And Moses' people made of their ornaments a calf after 
him — a (lifeless) body, having a lowing sound." Could they not 
see that it did not speak to them, nor guided them in the way? 
They took it (for worship) and they were unjust. 149 And when they 
repented and saw that they had gone astray, they said: If our Lord 
have not mercy on us and forgive us, we shall certainly be losers. 

150 And when Moses returned to his people, angry, grieved, 
he said: Evil is what you have done after me! Did you hasten on 
the judgment of your Lord? And he threw down the tablets and 
seized his brother by the head, dragging him towards him. (Aaron) 
said: Son of my mother, the people reckoned me weak and had 
almost killed me. So do not make the enemies to rejoice over me 
and do not count me among the unjust people. 151 (Moses) said: 
My Lord, forgive me and my brother, and admit us to Your 
mercy, and You are the most Merciful of those who show mercy.' 

Section 19: The Torah and the Prophet's Advent 

152 Those who took the calf (for a god) — wrath from their 
Lord, and disgrace in this world's life, will surely come upon them. 



a (148) The word jasad means a body, as well as red or intensely yellow. 
The former meaning indicates that the calf was a mere lifeless body, yet it was so 
made that it gave a lowing sound like that of a calf. The other meaning also pro- 
vides a true description of the calf as it was made of gold ornaments. 

b (149) The Israelites' repentance, though mentioned first, was subsequent to 
Moses' return (2:54). The order here connects the repentance with the sin. 

c (151) Aaron's excuse and Moses' acceptance of it show clearly that Aaron 
was quite innocent, having had a share neither in making the calf nor in wor- 
shipping it. The Bible account, which makes a righteous prophet of God guilty of 
the most heinous crime, must be rejected as untrue. That forgiveness was not 
sought for any fault in connection with calf-worship is clear from the fact that 
Moses joins himself with Aaron in the prayer given in this verse. Forgiveness 
here, as frequently elsewhere in the Quran, is equivalent to the Divine protection 
which everyone should seek against the shortcomings of human nature. 



210 7. THE ELEVATED PLACES "7:153 

And thus do We recompense those who invent lies. 153 And those 
who do evil deeds, then repent after that and believe — your Lord 
after that is surely Forgiving, Merciful. 154 And when Moses' anger 
calmed down, he took up the tablets; and in the writing thereof 
was guidance and mercy for those who fear their Lord. 

155 And Moses chose of his people seventy men for Our 
appointment." So when the earthquake struck them, he said: My 
Lord, if You had pleased, You would have destroyed them before 
and myself (too). Will You destroy us for what the foolish among 
us have done? It is only Your trial. You cause to perish by it 
whom You please and guide whom You please. You are our Pro- 
tector, so forgive us and have mercy on us, and You are the Best 
of those who forgive. 156 And ordain for us good in this world's 
life and in the Hereafter, for surely we turn to You. He said: I 
afflict with My punishment whom I please, and My mercy encom- 
passes all things. So I ordain it for those who keep their duty and 
give the due charity, and those who believe in Our messages — 
1S7 those who follow the Messenger-Prophet, the Umml, c whom 
they find mentioned in the Torah and the Gospel. He enjoins 



a (155) Exodus 24: 1 speaks of Moses having taken up seventy elders of 
Israel along with him, though they were forbidden to "come near the Lord", and 
on this occasion Moses was in the mountain forty days and forty nights (Exodus, 
24:18). Although the Bible also speaks of Moses as going to the mountain for 
forty days and forty nights after the incident of the calf-worship (Exodus, 34:28), 
the Quran refers only to the first occasion. 

b (156) No attribute of God receives such prominence in the Quran as the 
attribute of mercy — My mercy encompasses all things. Even punishment is a 
phase of Divine mercy because it seeks to correct the evil-doers. 

c (157-1) UmmT means one who neither writes nor reads a writing. Hence 
the Arabs are called an ummT people, and the UmmT Prophet is either the prophet 
of the ummT people (i.e. the Arabs) because he was like them, or he was so called 
because he himself did not know reading and writing. But according to some, the 
prophet is called UmmT because he came from the Umm al-Qura, i.e. Makkah, 
which is the Metropolis of Arabia. 

d (157-2) There are many prophecies regarding the advent of the Holy Pro- 
phet in the Bible. The Torah and the Gospel are specially mentioned here because 
Moses and Jesus were respectively the first and the last of the Israelite prophets. 
Deuteronomy 18:15-18 speaks very clearly of the raising of a prophet, who shall

good things and prohibits for them impure things, and removes 
from them their burden and the shackles which were on them. So 
those who believe in him and honour him and help him, and 
follow the light which has been sent down with him — these are 
the successful. 

Section 20: Divine Favours on Israelites 

158 Say: O mankind, surely I am the Messenger of Allah to

or the Arabs, while Deuteronomy 33:2 speaks of the shining forth of the manifes- 
tation of the Lord, i.e. his coming in full glory "from Mount Paran". The Gospel 
is full of prophecies of the advent of the Holy Prophet; Matthew 21 :33^44, Mark 
12:1-11, Luke 20:9-18, where the Lord of the vineyard comes after the son (i.e. 
Jesus) is maltreated, and Matthew 13:31-32, John 1:21, John 14:16, John 14:26 
all contain such prophecies. 

a (158) As against the various prophets spoken of in this chapter, every one 
of whom was sent to his people, the Prophet Muhammad is here spoken of as hav- 
ing been sent to all people, to the whole of mankind. Thus the appearance of the 
Prophet Muhammad was a turning point in the history of humanity. The day of 
the national prophet was over and a new era had dawned in which the whole of 
humanity was ultimately to be united under one spiritual head. The idea of nation- 
ality had to give place to the broader idea of one humanity, and the basis of it was 
laid by the Quran. 

b (159) Thus the Quran recognizes that there were good people among the 
Jews. See also v. 168.

own souls. 

161 And when it was said to them: Dwell in this town and eat 
from it wherever you wish, and make petition for forgiveness, and 
enter the gate submissively, We shall forgive you your wrongs. 
We shall give more to the doers of good. 162 But those who were 
unjust among them changed it for a word other than that which 
they were told, so We sent upon them a pestilence from heaven

When they violated the Sabbath, when their fish came to them on 
their Sabbath day on the surface, and when it was not their 
Sabbath they did not come to them. Thus did We try them because 
they transgressed. 164 And when some of them said: Why do you 
preach to a people whom Allah would destroy or whom He would 
punish with a severe punishment? They said: To be free from 
blame before your Lord, and that perhaps they may guard against 
evil. 165 So when they neglected what they had been reminded of, 
We delivered those who forbade evil and We overtook those who 
were wrongdoers with an evil punishment because they trans- 
gressed. 

166 So when they revoltingly persisted in what they had been 
forbidden, We said to them: Be (as) apes, despised and hated. 
167 And when your Lord declared that He would send against them 
to the day of Resurrection those who would subject them to severe

b (163) The city referred to here is generally recognized as being Ela, which 
was situated on the Red Sea. The incident alluded to is mentioned as an instance 
of the Jewish violation of the Sabbath. The fish appeared on the surface of the 
water on the Sabbath because they had a sense of security on that day. This was a 
temptation for the people to break the law.

(different) groups — some of them are righteous and some of them 
are otherwise. And We tried them with blessings and misfortunes 
that they might turn. 

169 Then after them came an evil generation who inherited the 
Book, taking the frail goods of this low life and saying: It will be 
forgiven us. And if (more) such good came to them, they would 
take it (too). a Was not a promise taken from them in the Book that 
they would not speak anything about Allah but the truth? And 
they study what is in it. And the abode of the Hereafter is better 
for those who keep their duty. Do you not then understand? 
170 And as for those who hold fast by the Book and keep up prayer 
— surely We do not waste the reward of the reformers. m And 
when We shook the mountain over them as if it were a covering, 
and they thought that it was going to fall down upon them: Hold 
on firmly what We have given you, and bear in mind what is in it, 
so that you may guard against evil. 4 

Section 22: Evidence of Divine Impress on Man's Nature 

172 And when jour Lord brought forth from the children of 
Adam, from their loins, their descendants, and made them bear 
witness about themselves: Am I not your Lord? They said: Yes, we 
bear witness. c In case you should say on the day of Resurrection: 
We were unaware of this, 173 or you should say: Only our fathers 



a (169) First they commit a crime for the frail goods of this life, saying that 
they will be forgiven; then persist in their evil course and when a similar occasion 
arises, they again return to the old crimes. There is no repentance. 

b (171) The stories built upon these simple words by some commentators 
must be rejected. The words simply relate the experience of the elders of Israel 
when they stood at the foot of the mountain, which rose above them. There was a 
severe earthquake, which is referred to in v. 155, causing them to think that the 
mountain would fall down upon them. 

c (172) The verse does not mention the bringing forth of descendants from 
Adam, but from the children of Adam, and this seems clearly to refer to every 
human being as he comes into existence. The evidence is, therefore, given by 
human nature itself. It is, in fact, the same evidence which is elsewhere spoken of 
as being afforded by human nature as in "the nature made by Allah in which He 
has created mankind" (30:30).

set up partners (with Allah) before (us), and we were (their) 
descendants after them. Will You destroy us for what liars did? 
174 And thus do We make the messages clear, and that perhaps they 
may return. 

175 And recite to them the news of him to whom We give 
Our messages, but he withdraws himself from them, so the devil 
follows him up, and he is of those who perish." 176 And if We had 
pleased, We would have exalted him thereby; but he clings to the 
earth and follows his low desire. His parable is as the parable of 
the dog — if you drive him away, he lolls out his tongue, and if 
you leave him alone, he lolls out his tongue. Such is the parable of 
the people who reject Our messages. So relate the narrative that 
they may reflect. 177 Evil is the likeness of the people who reject 
Our messages and wrong their own souls. 178 He whom Allah guides 
is on the right way; and he whom He leaves in error — they are 
the losers. 

179 And certainly We have created for hell many of the jinn 
and the people — they have hearts with which they do not under- 
stand, and they have eyes with which they do not see, and they 
have ears with which they do not hear. c They are as cattle; rather, 
they are more astray. These are the heedless ones. 180 And Allah's 
are the best names, so call on Him thereby d and leave alone those 



a (175) This verse speaks generally of everyone to whom guidance is brought 
but he turns aside from it. This view is corroborated by what is stated at the con- 
clusion of the parable in v. 176, such is the parable of the people who reject Our 
messages. 

b (176) Earth here stands for all that is earthly, for things material. The 
people spoken of here are those who do not care for the higher values of life. 

c (179) Many people and jinn are created for hell, but they are none other 
than the heedless ones who do not care for what is said. Allah has not created 
them differently from others, but they themselves do not use the faculties which 
Allah has granted them. 

d (180-1) By the best names are meant names expressing the most excellent 
attributes of the Divine Being. By calling on Him thereby is meant that man 
should always keep the Divine attributes before his mind, endeavouring to possess 
those attributes. 



7:181' THE COMING OF THE DOOM 2 1 5 

who violate the sanctity of His names." They will be recompensed 
for what they do. 181 And of those whom We have created is a 
community who guide with the truth and with it they do justice. 

Section 23: The Coming of the Doom 

182 And those who reject Our messages — We lead them (to 
destruction) step by step from where they do not know. 183 And I 
grant them respite. Surely My scheme is effective. 184 Do they not 
reflect (that) there is no madness in their companion? He is only a 
plain warner. 185 Do they not consider the kingdom of the heavens 
and the earth and what things Allah has created, and that it may be 
that their doom has drawn near? In what announcement after this 
will they then believe? 186 Whomsoever Allah leaves in error, there 
is no guide for him. And He leaves them alone in their inordinacy, 
blindly wandering on. 

187 They ask you about the Hour, c when will it take place? 
Say: Its knowledge is with my Lord only. None but He will mani- 
fest it at its time. It is momentous in the heavens and the earth. It 
will not come to you but suddenly. They ask you as if you could 
find out about it (by effort). Say: Its knowledge is with Allah only, 
but most people do not know. 188 Say: I do not control benefit nor 
harm for myself except as Allah please. And if I had known the 
unseen, I should have much of good, and no evil would touch me. 
I am but a warner and the giver of good news to a people who 
believe. 



a (180-2) Violation of the sanctity of His names is of two kinds: firstly, 
giving Him an improper or inaccurate attribute; and secondly, to interpret His 
attributes in a manner which does not befit Him. 

b (183) The word kaid (scheme), in relation to God, indicates skill in the 
management or ordering of affairs. 

c (187) That is, the Hour with which they are threatened as being the hour of 
their doom. The word sa 'ah or the hour is used in the Quran to indicate both the 
doom of the guilty in this life and the time when a perfect manifestation of rewards 
and punishments will take place in the Hereafter. 

rf(188) The simplicity and nobility of this statement as indicating the 
mission of a prophet is unsurpassed. He gives glad news of triumph to those who

189 He it is Who created you from a single soul, and of the 
same did He make his mate, that he might find comfort in her. So 
when he covers her she bears a light burden, then moves about 
with it. Then when it grows heavy, they both call upon Allah, their 
Lord: If You give us a good one, we shall certainly be grateful. 
190 But when He gives them a good one, they set up with Him part- 
ners in what He has given them." Supremely exalted is Allah above 
what they set up as partners (with Him). 191 Do they set up (with 
Him) that which has not created anything, while they are them- 
selves created? 192 And they cannot give them help, nor can they 
help themselves. 

193 And if you invite them to guidance, they will not follow 
you. It is the same to you whether you invite them or you are silent. 
194 Those whom you call on besides Allah are slaves like your- 
selves; so call on them, then let them answer you, if you are 
truthful. 195 Do they have feet with which they walk, or do they 
have hands with which they hold, or do they have eyes with which 
they see, or do they have ears with which they hear? Say: Call 
upon your associate-gods then plot against me and give me no 
respite. 196 Surely my Friend is Allah, Who revealed the Book, and 
He befriends the righteous. 197 And those whom you call upon 
besides Him are not able to help you, nor can they help them- 
selves.

well as in the next, but he does not claim the possession of Divine powers. 

a (190) This describes the condition of man in general and refers to the 
evidence of his nature, for when in distress he always turns to Allah, but when in 
ease he goes after other gods or his own low desires. 

b (193) Invitation to Truth must be extended to all, though some may not 
benefit by it. The meaning is further clarified in verses 198-199.

200 And if a false imputation from the devil afflict .you," seek refuge 
in Allah. Surely He is Hearing, Knowing. 201 Those who guard 
against evil, when a visitation from the devil afflicts them, they 
become mindful, then lo! they see. 202 And their brethren c 
increase them in error, then they do not cease. 

203 And when you do not bring them a sign, they say: Why 
do you not demand it? Say: I follow only what is revealed to me 
from my Lord. These are clear proofs from your Lord and a 
guidance and a mercy for a people who believe. 204 And when the 
Quran is recited, listen to it and remain silent, that mercy may be 
shown to you. 205 And remember your Lord within yourself humbly 
and fearing, and in a voice not loud, in the morning and the 
evening, and do not be one of the heedless. 206 Surely those who 
are with your Lord are not too proud to serve Him, and they 
glorify Him and prostrate themselves before Him. 



a (200) The devil in this case, as frequently in the Quran, stands for the 
devilish enemies who spread all kinds of false reports concerning the Holy Pro- 
phet, against which he is told to seek refuge in Allah. 

b (201) The visitation of the devil means the happening of any grievous inci- 
dent or the coming of an affliction from the hands of the devil, or the wicked 
acting in opposition to the righteous. Being endowed with insight, they see their 
way out of the affliction. The devil's visitation may also signify anger which 
blinds a man, and those who guard against evil are not blinded by it. 

c (202) That is, the brethren of the devils, or the devil's human associates. 



Chapter 8 
Ai-Anfai Voluntary Gifts 

This chapter deals with the battle of Badr, the first battle which the Muslims 
had to fight, and it goes under the name of Anfal, literally voluntary gifts, 
because the Muslim State had at the time no treasury, nor any arsenal, nor an 
army and voluntary gifts were therefore called for. It was not only this battle 
but all the succeeding battles which Muslims had to fight were carried on only 
by voluntary gifts. Success in this battle, against all odds, provided proof of 
the truth of the Holy Prophet's mission and thus this chapter occurs after a dis- 
cussion of prophethood in the last chapter. Most of this chapter was revealed 
in 2 A.H., while the concluding verses of sections 7 and 8 were revealed 
around the time of the conquest of Makkah in 8 A.H. 



Section 1 : The Battle of Badr — Muslims go forth 

In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful. 

1 They ask you about voluntary gifts. Say: Voluntary gifts are 
for Allah and the Messenger/ So keep your duty to Allah and set 
aright your differences, and obey Allah and His Messenger, if you 
are believers. 2 They only are believers whose hearts are full of 
fear when Allah is mentioned, and when His messages are recited 
to them they increase them in faith, and in their Lord do they trust, 
3 those who keep up prayer and spend (on good works) out of what 
We have given them. 4 These are the believers truly. For them are 
with their Lord exalted grades and protection and an honourable 
sustenance. 



a (1) There is much difference of opinion among the commentators as to 
what is meant by anfal here. The most generally received opinion is that it means 
property acquired during the war. I take the word anfal as carrying here its literal 
significance of voluntary gifts for the advancement of the cause of Islam, such 
voluntary gifts being most needed at a time when the very life of Islam was threat- 
ened. Indeed there is no better justification for a war than that it is carried on by 
the voluntary gifts of those whose life is in danger. It is the only war that is really 
carried on by the people in self-defence.

8:5' THE BATTLE OF BADR 219 

5 Even as your Lord caused you to go forth from your house 
with truth, though some of the believers were surely averse," 
disputing with you about the truth after it had become clear — as 
if they were being driven to death while they saw (it). 7 And when 
Allah promised you one of the two parties that it should be yours, 
and you loved that the one not armed should be yours, and Allah 
desired to establish the Truth by His words, c and to cut off the root 
of the disbelievers — 8 that He might cause the Truth to triumph 
and bring falsehood to failure, though the guilty disliked. 

9 When you sought the aid of your Lord, so He answered you: 
I will assist you with a thousand of the angels following one an- 
other. 10 And Allah gave it only as good news, and that your hearts 



a (5) The circumstances of the battle of Badr have been misunderstood. It is 
alleged that the Holy Prophet had made preparations for attacking an unarmed 
caravan of the Quraish on its way back from Syria to Makkah, when Abu Sufyan, 
the caravan leader, sent word to Makkah and obtained an escort of nearly a 
thousand men. If the Holy Prophet had desired to plunder the caravan when it 
approached Madinah, he would have done so long before Abu Sufyan could 
obtain assistance from Makkah, as Madinah was thirteen days' journey from 
Makkah. Badr lies at a distance of three days' journey from Madinah. The enemy 
had marched forth for ten days and the Muslims only for three days when the two 
forces encountered each other at Badr, which shows clearly that the Muslims had 
turned out to take the defensive against an invading force. It is clearly stated here 
that some of the believers were averse to fighting. They could not have been 
averse if they had to encounter only an unarmed caravan. It is said in the next 
verse that they went forth as if they were being driven to death. They knew that 
they were going to meet an enemy treble in numbers and much more powerful 
and efficient. 

b (7-1) The two parties referred to were the unarmed caravan of the Quraish 
going to Makkah and the armed force of the Quraish that was on its way to 
Madinah. Naturally, some of the Muslims desired that their encounter should take 
place with the unarmed Quraish caravan. 

c (7-2) By His words is meant here the fulfilment of His words, because the 
Holy Prophet had declared at Makkah long before that an encounter would take 
place between the Muslims and the Quraish, in which the former would be victo- 
rious. The Holy Prophet himself repeated one of these prophecies aloud in the 
field when he prayed on the day of Badr: "Soon shall the armies be routed, and 
they will show their backs" (54:45).

might be at ease by it. a And victory is only from Allah; surely 
Allah is Mighty, Wise. 

Section 2: The Battle of Badr — Fighting 

11 When He made slumber fall on you as a security from 
Him, and sent down upon you water from the clouds that He 
might purify you with it,* and take away from you the uncleanness 
of the devil, and that He might fortify your hearts and make firm 
(your) feet by it. e 12 When jour Lord revealed to the angels: I am 
with you, so make firm those who believe. I will cast terror into 
the hearts of those who disbelieve. So strike above the necks and 
strike every finger-tip of them. 13 This is because they opposed 
Allah and His Messenger. And whoever opposes Allah and His 
Messenger — then surely Allah is Severe in retribution. 14 This — 
taste it, and (know) that for the disbelievers is the punishment of 
the Fire. 



a (10) See 3:124 footnote. It is nowhere stated in the Quran that the angels 
actually fought, but here, as in 3:126, we are told that the angels were sent down 
to bear good news of victory and to ease the hearts of the Muslims. Here, how- 
ever, we are further told that, as a result of the coming of the angels, calm fell 
upon the Muslims, their hearts being strengthened and their footsteps being 
steadied (v. 11), and that while the believers were thus made firm, terror was cast 
into the hearts of the disbelievers (v. 12). Hence it is that the number of angels 
corresponds with the strength of the enemy force in each case. 

b (11-1) Compare 25:25, which is a prophecy about the events of this 
remarkable battle: "And on the day when the heaven bursts apart with clouds, and 
the angels are sent down, as they are sent". The rainfall brought many advantages 
to the Muslims, for which see the next footnote. 

c (11-2) Before the rain fell the Muslim position was very weak. The enemy 
had the command of the water and the Muslims were in a low and sandy place. 
Therefore there were some who had misgivings, which, as is said here, were due 
to the devil's uncleanness. The enemy having taken possession of the drinking- 
water, the Muslims feared being troubled by thirst, which is called the devil of the 
desert. The rain strengthened the position of the Muslims and consequently com- 
forted their hearts. This was a purification, for after the rainfall they all became 
certain of Divine help and so of their triumph over the enemy. 

d (12) The two phrases, strike above the necks and strike the finger-tips, 
respectively signify the killing of the enemy and disabling him so as to render him 
unfit for taking further part in fighting. 



8:15' THE BATTLE OF BADR 221 

15 O you who believe, when you meet those who disbelieve 
marching for war, do not turn your backs to them. 16 And whoever 
turns his back to them on that day — unless manoeuvring for 
battle or turning to join a company — he indeed incurs Allah's 
wrath and his refuge is hell. And an evil destination it is. 17 So you 
did not kill them but Allah killed them, and you (O Prophet) did 
not strike when you struck (the enemy), but Allah struck (him), a 
and that He might confer upon the believers a benefit from 
Himself. Surely Allah is Hearing, Knowing. 18 This c — and 
(know) that Allah will weaken the struggle of the disbelievers. 
19 If you sought a judgment, the judgment has indeed come to you; 
and if you cease (fighting), it is better for you. And if you return 
(to fighting), We (too) shall return and your forces will not avail 
you at all, though they may be many; and (know) that Allah is 
with the believers. 

Section 3: The Way to Success 

20 O you who believe, obey Allah and His Messenger and do 
not turn away from Him while you hear. 21 And do not be like 
those who say, We hear; and they do not hear. 22 Surely the vilest 
of beasts, in Allah's sight, are the deaf, the dumb, who do 



a (17-1) Rama carries a number of significances, including throwing, fling- 
ing, assailing and striking. It is used in connection with fighting, and therefore 
striking is its equivalent here. The first part of the verse about killing refers to the 
Muslims generally, the address being in the plural; and the second part, being in 
the singular, is understood as referring to the Holy Prophet. The Muslims killed 
the enemy, but it is affirmed that really they did not kill, but it was Allah Who 
killed them; the meaning apparently being that Allah's hand was working in the 
battle. The same applies to the other passage relating to the striking of the enemy 
by the Holy Prophet. Whether the Prophet actually threw a handful of pebbles at 
the enemy, which discomfited the latter, is a different question. It was Allah's 
hand that killed them, and it was His hand that struck them and ultimately put 
them to rout. 

b (17-2) The benefit spoken of here is a victory which strengthened the 
foundations of Islam, and dealt a death-blow to the evil designs of those who were 
determined to exterminate it, as is plainly stated in the next verse. 

c (18) This here stands for: this was the Divine purpose in bringing about 
this encounter.

not understand." 23 And if Allah had known any good in them, He 
would have made them hear. And if He makes them hear, they 
would turn away while they are averse. 

24 O you who believe, respond to Allah and His Messenger, 
when he calls you to that which gives you life. ' And know that 
Allah comes in between a man and his heart,' and that to Him you 
will be gathered. 25 And guard yourselves against an affliction 
which may not strike those of you exclusively who are wrong- 
doers; and know that Allah is Severe in retribution. 

26 And remember when you were few, considered weak in 
the land, fearing if people should carry you off by force, He shel- 
tered you and strengthened you with His help, and gave you good 
things that you might give thanks. 27 you who believe, do not be 
unfaithful to Allah and the Messenger, nor be unfaithful to your 
trusts, while you know. 28 And know that your wealth and your 
children are a temptation, and that Allah is He with Whom there is 
a mighty reward. 

Section 4: Muslims to be Guardians of the Sacred Mosque 

29 O you who believe, if you keep your duty to Allah, He will 
grant you a distinction and do away with your evils and protect 
you. And Allah is the Lord of mighty grace. 30 And when those 



a (22) The deaf and the dumb signify those who are spiritually deaf and 
dumb — those who do not understand. 

b (24-1) Faith or submission to Allah is life, and disbelief is death. By the 
expression that which gives you life some understand the Quran, others take it to 
meanjihad, or exertion in the cause of truth. Evidently it is faith. 

c (24-2) By heart is meant the desires of the heart. The Divine intervention 
is the cutting off of those desires. The faithful are enjoined to be quick in respond- 
ing to the call of the Holy Prophet, and not to indulge in worldly desires, for these 
may soon be cut off. Or, the meaning is that they must respond to the call of the 
Holy Prophet in case, having deprived themselves of one occasion of doing good, 
the heart should be hardened, and, as a punishment for the first rejection, Allah 
may so turn it that it may not turn to good at all. 

d (25) This refers to afflictions that are of such a widespread nature as to 
overtake even others, in addition to those for whom they are primarily intended.

who disbelieved devised plans against you that they might confine 
you or kill you or drive you away — and they devised plans and 
Allah, too, had arranged a plan; and Allah is the Best of planners. " 
31 And when Our messages are recited to them, they say: We have 
heard. If we wished, we could say the like of it; this is nothing but 
the stories of the ancients. 

32 And when they said: O Allah, if this is indeed the truth 
from You, then rain down on us stones from heaven or inflict on 
us a painful punishment. 33 And Allah would not punish them 
while you were among them; nor would Allah punish them while 
they seek forgiveness. e 34 And what excuse have they that Allah 
should not punish them while they hinder (people) from the 
Sacred Mosque and they are not its (true) guardians? Its guardians 
are only those who keep their duty, but most of them do not 
know.^ 35 And their prayer at the House is nothing but whistling 
and clapping of hands. 2 Taste, then, the punishment, because you 
disbelieved. 

36 Surely those who disbelieve spend their wealth to hinder 
(people) from the way of Allah. So they will go on spending it, 
then it will be to them a regret, then they will be overcome. And 
those who disbelieve will be gathered together to hell, 37 that Allah 



a (30) The reference is to the final plans of the Quraish when, the Com- 
panions having emigrated to Madinah, the Prophet was left alone at Makkah. The 
Divine plan was that the disbelievers should see the downfall of their power at the 
hands of the Prophet. 

b (31) That this was an empty boast is confirmed by the fact that, although 
the Quran repeatedly challenged them to produce anything like it, they could not 
produce even the like of its shortest chapter. 

c (33) The punishment was to overtake them when the Holy Prophet was no 
more among them, i.e. after his flight from Makkah. But even then the punish- 
ment might be averted if they asked for forgiveness. 

d (34) The words contain a prophecy not only as to the deprivation of the 
disbelieving Quraish of the guardianship of the Ka'bah, but also as to the passing 
of the guardianship into the hands of the Muslims.

But if they cease, then surely Allah is Seer of what they do. 
40 And if they turn back, then know that Allah is your Patron. Most 
excellent the Patron and most excellent the Helper! 

41 And know that whatever you acquire in war, a fifth of it is 
for Allah and for the Messenger and for the near of kin and the 
orphans and the needy and the traveller/ if you believe in Allah 



a (38) They had gone away from Badr quite discomfited, and they were told 
that, if they ceased fighting, they would be forgiven. Otherwise, they could read 
their own doom in the doom of those with whom Allah had dealt previously in 
similar circumstances. 

b (39) That is, if they cease fighting and put an end to their mischief, God's 
decree of punishment will not be executed. The state of religious liberty which 
Islam aimed at is put tersely in the two opening statements — there is no more 
persecution and all religions are for Allah, everyone being at liberty to hold any 
belief he likes. 

c (41-1) The one-fifth spoken of here is to be divided again into five parts, 
the Prophet, the near of kin, the orphans, the poor, and the traveller being equal 
sharers. The near of kin included all individuals belonging to the tribes of Bani 
Hashim and Bani Abdul Muttalib, to whom zakat money was not allowed. The 
poor among them were thus paid from this source of income. As to the Holy 
Prophet's twenty-fifth, it was also used for the benefit of the Muslims. The re- 
maining four-fifths of the acquisitions were divided among those who took part in 
the battle, as they were not otherwise paid for their services, but there is no order 
to this effect in the Quran itself. This arrangement was simply an exigency. War 
was forced on Muslims all of a sudden when the State had not yet been properly 
formed; there was no army at all, nor a treasury from which to pay it; and just as 
they were required to carry on war on the basis of voluntary gifts, so they were 
allowed a share in the war acquisitions. If the State pays its soldiers as it pays its 
civil servants, the war acquisitions would all go to the State treasury. 



8 : 42 • BADR AS SIGN OF THE PROPHET'S TRUTH 225 

and in what We revealed to Our servant, on the day of Distinction, 
the day on which the two forces met." And Allah is Powerful over 
all things. 

42 When you were on the nearer side (of the valley) and they 
were on the farther side, while the caravan was in a lower place 
than you. And if you had tried to make a mutual appointment, you 
would certainly have broken away from the appointment, but c — 
in order that Allah might bring about a matter which had to be 
done; that he who perished by clear argument might perish, and 
he who lived by clear argument might live. 6 And surely Allah is 
Hearing, Knowing: 43 When Allah showed them to you in jour 
dream as few ' — and if He had shown them to you as many, you 
(O Muslims) would certainly have become weak-hearted and you 
would have disputed about the matter, but Allah saved (you). 
Surely He is Knower of what is in the hearts. 44 And when He 
showed them to you, when you met, as few in your eyes, and He 
made you to appear few in their eyes, in order that Allah might 
bring about a matter which had to be done. g And to Allah are all 
affairs returned. 



a (41-2) The day of Distinction (yaum al-furqan) referred to here is the 
battle of Badr. 

b (42-1) The Muslims were on the side nearer to Madinah, the main army of 
the Quraish was on the side which was farther from Madinah, while the caravan 
was in a lower place, i.e. towards the sea-coast, and farther away from Madinah, 
on its way to Makkah. 

c (42-2) There is a break here, the meaning being but an encounter was 
brought about without an appointment. The Muslims were so weak that they 
could not think of making an appointment with the enemy — they would have 
broken away from the appointment. 

d (42-3) The matter referred to is the defeat of the opponents of Islam. 

e (42-4) The disbelievers had seen clear arguments of the Holy Prophet's 
truth, yet they rejected him and had thus perished in a spiritual sense; they were 
now vanquished in the battle and thus perished temporally. 

/(43) The Holy Prophet's seeing them few in a vision must be interpreted as 
signifying their actual weakness, despite their great number. 

g (44) Here we are told that they were also shown to be few to the Muslims 
when the two armies met. See 3:13 and footnote.

Section 6: Success does not depend on Numbers 

45 O you who believe, when you meet an army, be firm, and 
remember Allah much, that you may be successful. 46 And obey 
Allah and His Messenger and do not dispute with one another so 
that you get weak-hearted and your power departs; and be stead- 
fast. Surely Allah is with the steadfast. 

47 And do not be like those who came forth from their homes 
exultingly and to be seen by people, and they hinder (people) from 
the way of Allah." And Allah encompasses what they do. 48 And 
when the devil made their works seem good to them, and said: No 
man can overcome you this day, and I am your protector. But 
when the two armies came in sight of one another, he turned upon 
his heels, and said: Surely I am clear of you, I see what you do not 
see; surely I fear Allah. And Allah is Severe in retribution. 

Section 7: Enemy's Strength weakened 

49 And when the hypocrites and those in whose hearts is a 
disease said: Their religion has deluded them. And whoever trusts 
in Allah, then surely Allah is Mighty, Wise. 50 And if you could 
see when the angels cause to die those who disbelieve, striking 
their faces and their backs, and (saying): Taste the punishment of 
burning. 51 This is for what your hands have sent ahead, and 
because Allah is not in the least unjust to the servants — 52 in the 
manner of the people of Pharaoh and those before them, they 
disbelieved in Allah's messages, so Allah punished them for their 
sins. Surely Allah is Strong, Severe in retribution. 53 This is because 
Allah never changes a favour which He has conferred upon a 
people until they change their own condition — and because Allah 
is Hearing, Knowing — 54 in the manner of the people of Pharaoh, 
and those before them. They rejected the messages of their Lord, 



a (47) This clearly refers to the army of the Quraish which had marched 
forth in great exultation to destroy Madinah. 

b (48) The person referred to here as the devil is said to have been Suraqa 
ibn Malik who gave the Quraish promise of help. However, what is stated here 
may only be the devil's suggestion to the Quraish leaders. 



8:55' PEACE TO BE SECURED BY STRENGTH 227 

so We destroyed them for their sins. And We drowned Pharaoh's 
people and they were all wrongdoers. 

55 Surely the vilest of beasts in Allah's sight are those who 
disbelieve, then they would not believe — 56 those with whom you 
make an agreement, then they break their agreement every time, 
and they do not keep their duty." 57 So if >>ou overtake them in war, 
scatter by them those who are behind them, that they may be mind- 
ful. 58 And if you fear treachery on the part of a people, throw 
back to them (their treaty) on terms of equality. Surely Allah does 
not love the treacherous. c 

Section 8: Peace to be secured by Strength 

59 And those who disbelieve should not think that they can 
outstrip (Us). Surely they cannot escape. 60 And make ready for 
them whatever force you can and horses tied at the frontier, to 
frighten thereby the enemy of Allah and your enemy and others 
besides them, whom you do not know — Allah knows them. And 
whatever you spend in Allah's way, it will be paid back to you 
fully and you will not be wronged. 



a (56) It shows how the opponents of Islam disregarded their responsibility 
and violated their agreements. The use of the words every time shows clearly that 
the Muslims never hesitated in making a new agreement when one was violated, 
but the disbelievers did not even then respect their agreements; hence, as a last 
resort, Muslims were allowed to repudiate unrespected agreements (v. 58). 

b (57) That is, an exemplary punishment should be inflicted on them, so that 
a stop might be put to further fighting and bloodshed. 

c (58) If the other party does not remain faithful to the agreement of peace, 
Muslims may also repudiate it. The word fear does not indicate that a mere appre- 
hension, unsupported by any action on the other side's part, is sufficient for 
repudiation. Read it along with v. 62, and the meaning is clear. 

d (60) Muslims had won a victory at Badr, though they were not even well- 
equipped and had made no preparation for the war. But they are told that they 
must in future keep themselves well prepared and avail themselves of all sources 
of strength, so that the enemy should by their very preparedness assume a peace- 
ful attitude. It was evident that the weakness of the Muslims was a temptation for 
their opponents to attack them. 



228 8. VOLUNTARY GIFTS • 8 : 61 

61 And if they incline to peace, you (must) incline to it also, 
and trust in Allah. Surely He is the Hearer, the Knower. 62 And if 
they intend to deceive you, then surely Allah is sufficient for you." 
He it is Who strengthened you with His help and with the belie- 
vers, 63 and He has united their hearts. If you had spent all that is in 
the earth, you could not have united their hearts, but Allah united 
them. Surely He is Mighty, Wise. 64 Prophet, Allah is sufficient 
for you and those who follow you from the believers. 

Section 9: Muslims to meet Overwhelming Numbers 

65 O Prophet, urge the believers to fight. If there are of you 
twenty steadfast, they shall overcome two hundred; and if there 
are of you a hundred, they shall overcome a thousand of those 
who disbelieve, because they are a people who do not understand^ 
66 Now Allah has lightened your burden and He knows that there is 
weakness in you. So if there are of you a hundred steadfast, they 
shall overcome two hundred; and if there are of you a thousand, 
they shall overcome two thousand by Allah's permission. And 
Allah is with the steadfast. 



a (62) The deceit is in relation to what has been said in the previous verse, 
the meaning being that ;/ they intend to deceive you under the cloak of peace, 
even in such a case peace is to be accepted. 

b (65-1) It should be noted that the war to which Muslims were to be urged 
was the defensive war which they had to fight to save themselves and to protect the 
religion of Islam. The sword had been taken up against them; see 2:190, 2:217, 
22:39, etc. 

c (65-2) There is a clear prophecy here that, despite their fewer numbers, 
Muslims shall be victorious. After the battle of Badr came the battle of Uhud, in 
which Muslims were less than 1 to 4 against the enemy; this was followed by the 
battle of the Ahzab, in which they were 1 to 10, yet the enemy was routed. 

d (66) The statements in verses 65 and 66 relate to two different states of the 
Muslims. At the time of the battle of Badr there was no Muslim army in exis- 
tence. They had very few arms, and they had never been trained. This is referred 
to in the words: He knows that there is weakness in you. So the Muslim forces as 
then constituted could at most be a match for double their numbers. But a time did 
come when they were a match for ten times their numbers. So both the statements 
in the Quran proved true. 



8 : 67 • RELATIONS OF MUSLIM STATE WITH OTHERS 229 

67 It is not fit for a prophet to take captives unless he has 
fought and triumphed in the land. You desire the frail goods of 
this world, while Allah desires (for you) the Hereafter." And Allah 
is Mighty, Wise. 68 If an ordinance from Allah had not gone before, 
surely a great punishment would have befallen you for what you 
were going to do. 69 Eat then of the lawful and good (things) which 
you have acquired in war, and keep your duty to Allah. Surely 
Allah is Forgiving, Merciful. 

Section 10: Relations of Muslim State with Others 

70 O Prophet, say to those of the captives who are in your 
hands: If Allah knows anything good in your hearts, He will give 
you better than what has been taken from you, and will forgive 
you. And Allah is Forgiving, Merciful. 71 And if they intend to be 
treacherous to you, so indeed they have been treacherous to Allah 
before, but He gave (you) mastery over them. And Allah is Know- 
ing, Wise. 

72 Surely those who believed and fled (their homes) and 
struggled hard in Allah's way with their wealth and their lives, 
and those who gave shelter and helped — these are friends of 



a (67) The commentators are of opinion that this verse and the next refer to 
releasing the prisoners of war taken at Badr after taking ransom from them, which 
act, it is said, is here disapproved. But various considerations show that these 
verses refer to some other incidents. The reference is to the desire — not to an 
action already completed — of a party of the Muslims referred to in v. 7, and you 
loved that the one not armed should be yours. Some Muslims desired to attack 
and capture the unarmed caravan, but depredations like these, though committed 
by disbelievers upon Muslims, were not fit for a prophet. He must fight a hard 
fight in his defence first and then, if he overcomes the enemy, he may take pri- 
soners. Thus this injunction also declares slavery to be illegal, and allows only the 
retaining of those who are taken prisoners in war. The frail goods of this world 
appropriately refer to the caravan and its merchandise, while the addition of the 
concluding words in v. 69, eat then of the lawful and good things which you have 
acquired in war, shows that the ransom received on account of the prisoners is 
among the lawful and good things. 

b (68) That ordinance from Allah was to bring about an encounter with the 
main army of the Quraish at Badr. It is referred to in v. 7 and v. 42. 



230 8. VOLUNTARY GIFTS • 8 : 73 

one another. And those who believed and did not flee, you are not 
responsible for their protection until they flee. And if they seek 
help from you in the matter of religion, it is your duty to help (them) 
except against a people between whom and you there is a treaty ." 
And Allah is Seer of what you do. 73 And those who disbelieve are 
friends of one another. If you do not do it, there will be persecu- 
tion in the land and great mischief. 74 And those who believed 
and fled and struggled hard in Allah's way, and those who gave 
shelter and helped — these are the believers truly. For them is 
forgiveness and an honourable provision. 75 And those who believed 
afterwards and fled and struggled hard along with you, they are of 
you. And the relatives are nearer to one another in the ordinance 
of Allah. c Surely Allah is Knower of all things. 



a (72) Those who believed, and, having been persecuted, fled from their 
homes, i.e. the Muhajirin, formed a community at Madinah along with those who 
gave them shelter and helped them, i.e. the Ansar. But there were those who chose 
to remain in their homes. The Muslim community at Madinah could not undertake 
to guard the interests of such persons, and this is what is meant by saying, you are 
not responsible for their protection. But if they seek help in the matter of religion, 
it is incumbent on the Muslim community to give them help, unless there exists a 
treaty of alliance with the people against whom such help is sought. 

b (73) If you do not help your brethren in the matter of religion, the dis- 
believers will become more daring in their persecutions and in causing mischief 
and disorder in the land. 

c (75) When even strangers who have accepted Islam and fled from their 
homes become "of you", those who have in addition ties of relationship, possess 
every title to have their interests guarded by the Muslim community. 



Chapter 9 
Ai-Bara'at Immunity 

The name of this chapter (which is also called A l-Taubah or Repentance) refers 
to the declaration in its opening verses that Muslims were now not subject to 
their agreements with certain idolatrous Arab tribes who had been constantly 
breaking them (verses 7-13). The chapter thus first deals with the subject of 
agreements with them as depending on their adherence to them, and goes on 
to prophesy the triumph of Islam in Arabia and later in the world. It then refers 
to the expedition to Tabuk by Muslims undertaken at great sacrifice, and 
deals with the subject of those who excused themselves and the hypocrites. 
At the end, Muslims are reminded of the importance of the propagation of 
Islam and contributing towards it, which was the real object of Islam. This 
chapter was revealed in 9 A.H. This is the only chapter of the Quran not 
opening with Bismillah, "In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful", 
as it is, in a sense, a continuation of the last chapter. 



Section 1: Declaration of Immunity 

1 A declaration of immunity from Allah and His Messenger to 
those of the idolaters with whom you made an agreement." 2 So go 
about in the land for four months and know that you cannot escape 
Allah and that Allah will disgrace the disbelievers. 3 And an 
announcement from Allah and His Messenger to the people on the 
day of the greater pilgrimage that Allah is free from liability to the 
idolaters, and so is His Messenger. So if you repent, it will be 



a (1) This is a declaration of immunity from obligations with such of the 
idolatrous tribes of Arabia as had repeatedly broken their agreements with the 
Muslims. They broke their agreements again and again (8:56), yet the Muslims 
were enjoined to accept peace if the disbelievers consented to it, even after repea- 
ted violations (8:61). But this state of things could not continue long, for it was 
soon found that it was impossible to trust such neighbours. This repudiation of 
agreements took place on a large scale when the Muslims were absent on the 
Tabuk expedition. 

b (3) The first thirteen verses of this chapter were publicly proclaimed by Ali 
on the occasion of the pilgrimage in 9 A.H.

better for you; and if you turn away, then know that you will not 
escape Allah. And announce painful punishment to those who 
disbelieve — 4 except those of the idolaters with whom you made 
an agreement, then they have not failed you in anything and have 
not backed up anyone against you; so fulfil their agreement to the 
end of their term. Surely Allah loves those who keep their duty." 

5 So when the sacred months have passed, kill the idolaters, 
wherever you find them, and take them captive and besiege them 
and lie in wait for them in every ambush.* But if they repent and 
keep up prayer and give the due charity, leave their way free. c 
Surely Allah is Forgiving, Merciful. 6 And if anyone of the idola- 
ters seek your protection, protect him till he hears the word of 
Allah, then convey him to his place of safety. This is because they 
are a people who do not know.^ 



a (4) The exception given here makes it clear that the Muslims were not 
fighting with the idolaters on account of their religion, but on account of their 
having been untrue to their agreements. 

b (5-1) The clear exception of the last verse shows that by the idolaters here 
are meant, not all idolaters or polytheists wherever they may be found in the world, 
not even all idolaters of Arabia, but only those idolatrous tribes of Arabia assem- 
bled at the pilgrimage who had first made agreements with the Muslims and then 
violated them. The order to kill them and to make them prisoners and to besiege 
them and ambush them amounts clearly to an order to fight against them, as it is 
in war only that all these actions are made lawful. (Editor's Note: The expression 
"kill them wherever you find them" has also been used in 2:190-191, where it is 
also declared clearly: "And fight in the way of Allah against those who fight against 
you but do not be aggressive". Thus "wherever you find them" means wherever 
you find those who are engaged in fighting against you, after they have been the 
first to attack you.) 

c (5-2) The whole verse relates to certain idolatrous Arab tribes who had 
broken their engagements with the Muslims, and who had now been apprised of a 
similar repudiation by the Muslims. They had so often broken their word that they 
could no more be trusted. Yet, if they joined the brotherhood of Islam, and there 
was an absolute change in their condition, the punishment which they otherwise 
deserved could be remitted. It was a case of forgiving a guilty people who had 
repented. Nothing could be further from the truth than the allegation that this 
offers to the disbelievers the alternative of either being killed or accepting Islam. 

d (6) This verse leaves no doubt that the Holy Prophet was never ordered by 
God to kill anyone on account of his religion. Any idolater seeking the protection 



9:7* REASONS FOR THE IMMUNITY 233 

Section 2: Reasons for the Immunity 

7 How can there be an agreement for the idolaters with Allah 
and with His Messenger, except those with whom you made an 
agreement at the Sacred Mosque? So as long as they are true to 
you, be true to them. Surely Allah loves those who keep their duty. a 
8 How (can it be)? And if they prevail against you, they respect 
neither ties of relationship nor covenant in your case. They would 
please you with their mouths while their hearts refuse; and most of 
them are transgressors. 

9 They have taken a small price for the messages of Allah, so 
they hinder (people) from His way. Surely evil is what they do. 
10 They respect neither ties of relationship nor covenant in the case 
of a believer. And these are they who go beyond the limits. n But 
if they repent and keep up prayer and give the due charity, they 
are your brethren in faith. And We make the messages clear for a 
people who know. 12 And if they break their oaths after their 
agreement and revile your religion, then fight the leaders of 
disbelief — surely their oaths are nothing — so that they may 
ceased 

13 Will you not fight a people who broke their oaths and 
aimed at the expulsion of the Messenger, and they attacked you 
first? Do you fear them? But Allah has more right that you should 
fear Him, if you are believers. 14 Fight them; Allah will punish 

of the Muslims in order to learn about Islam was to be granted safe conduct to 
return home in case he did not think it fit to embrace Islam. 

a (7) So long as the idolaters were true to their agreements, Muslims were 
required to be true to them. Just as in the case of war, Muslims were not allowed 
to fight until the enemy had first attacked, so, in the case of repudiation of agree- 
ments, it was the enemy who first repudiated the agreement. 

b (10) Note the repeated assertions of the Quran that the disbelievers were 
not to be fought against for their disbelief but for their being first in starting war 
or repudiating agreements. 

c (12) Those leaders of disbelief are to be fought against who break their 
oaths after their agreements. 

d (13) Editor's Note: This again makes clear that Muslims are only required 
to fight those who attacked them first.

them at your hands and bring them to disgrace, and assist you 
against them and relieve the hearts of a believing people, 15 and 
remove the rage of their hearts. And Allah turns (mercifully) to 
whom He pleases. And Allah is Knowing, Wise. 16 Do you think 
that you would be left alone while Allah has not yet known those 
of you who struggle hard and do not take anyone as an intimate 
friend besides Allah and His Messenger and the believers? And 
Allah is Aware of what you do. 

Section 3: Idolaters' Service of the Sacred House 

17 The idolaters have no right to maintain the mosques of 
Allah, while bearing witness to disbelief against themselves. 
These it is whose deeds are fruitless; and in the Fire will they 
abide. 18 Only he can maintain the mosques of Allah who believes 
in Allah and the Last Day, and keeps up prayer and gives the due 
charity and fears none but Allah. So these it is who may be of the 
guided ones. 19 Do you hold the giving of drink to the pilgrims and 
the maintenance of the Sacred Mosque equal to (the service of) 
one who believes in Allah and the Last Day and strives hard in 
Allah's way? They are not equal in the sight of Allah. And Allah 
does not guide the wrongdoing people. 20 Those who believed and 
fled (their homes), and strove hard in Allah's way with their 
wealth and their lives, are much higher in rank with Allah. And it 
is these that shall triumph. 21 Their Lord gives them good news of 
mercy and pleasure, from Himself, and Gardens in which lasting 
blessings will be theirs, 22 abiding in them forever. Surely Allah 
has a mighty reward with Him. 

23 O you who believe, do not take your fathers and your 
brothers for friends if they love disbelief above faith. And who- 



a (17) By the mosques of Allah is meant particularly the Sacred Mosque at 
Makkah, as being the centre of all the mosques of the world. This is made clear in 
v. 19. It had long remained in the hands of the idolaters, who visited and repaired 
it, having placed a large number of idols within it. With the conquest of Makkah 
the Sacred Mosque was denuded of all idols, and was now as pure an emblem of 
monotheism as in the time of Abraham. Hence the idol-worshippers had nothing 
to do with it now.

ever of you takes them for friends, such are the wrongdoers. 
24 Say: If your fathers and your sons and your brethren and your 
wives and your kinsfolk and the wealth you have acquired, and 
trade whose dullness you fear, and dwellings you love, are dearer 
to you than Allah and His Messenger and striving in His way, then 
wait till Allah brings His command to pass. And Allah does not 
guide the transgressing people." 

Section 4: Islam made Triumphant in Arabia 

25 Certainly Allah helped you in many battlefields, and on the 
day of Hunain, when your great numbers made you proud, but 
they availed you nothing, and the earth with all its vastness was 
narrowed for you, then you turned back retreating. 26 Then Allah 
sent down His calm upon His Messenger and upon the believers, 
and sent armies which you did not see, and punished those who 
disbelieved. And such is the reward of the disbelievers. 27 Then 
will Allah, after this, turn mercifully to whom He pleases. And 
Allah is Forgiving, Merciful. 

28 O you who believe, the idolaters are surely unclean, c so 



a (24) A true Muslim may have wealth, may carry on trade, may have mag- 
nificent houses, but these should not be dearer to him than Allah and exertion in 
His path. He should be ready to sacrifice all these interests for a higher purpose, 
before which all these sink into insignificance. The Quran does not require one 
actually to hate riches, but rather not to be obsessed by wealth to the neglect of 
one's higher duties. The acquisition of wealth is not harmful so long as it is not 
made the real aim of life, but has its proper place as the means to an end. 

b (25) The battle of Hunain, fought in 8 A.H. in the valley of Hunain, about 
three miles from Makkah, differed from the other battles in that the Muslims here 
outnumbered the enemy. However, the archers of the enemy were good marks- 
men, and had occupied strong positions in the mountain passes. The Muslim army 
contained some men from Makkah still adhering to idolatry. Unfortunately this 
was the advance party of the army, and, unable to face the archers, they retreated 
causing disorder to the whole army. The Holy Prophet, however, led the assault, 
at first alone, in face of the archers, but was soon joined by others and a victory 
was obtained, as the next verse shows. 

c (28-1) Because they indulged in evil practices and went naked round the 
Ka'bah. Compare 5:90, where idols are declared to be unclean.

they shall not approach the Sacred Mosque after this year of theirs." 
And if you fear poverty, then Allah will enrich you out of His 
grace, if He please. Surely Allah is Knowing, Wise. 29 Fight those 
who do not believe in Allah, nor in the Last Day, nor forbid what 
Allah and His Messenger have forbidden, nor follow the Religion 
of Truth, out of those who have been given the Book, until they

state of subjection/ 



a (28-2) The year of the proclamation, i.e. 9 A.H. 

b (28-3) The importance of Makkah as a commercial centre lay in the fact 
that the whole of Arabia repaired to it in the season of the pilgrimage, and there 
carried out important commercial transactions. The prohibition referred to in the 
first part of the verse could have been easily foreseen as affecting the commerce, 
and consequently the prosperity of Makkah, but worldly or business considera- 
tions never interfered with the carrying out of the moral reforms of Islam. 

c (29) The great Christian power, the Roman Empire, had just mobilized its 
forces for the subjection of the new religion, and the Tabflk expedition took place, 
which is dealt with further on in this chapter. As the object of this Christian power 
was simply the subjection of the Muslims, their final defeat by the Muslims is 
spoken of as subjection. It was not in any way the object of the Quran to bring the 
Christians into subjection. On the other hand, the Christians first moved them- 
selves to bring Muslim Arabia under subjection. Tbsjizyah or tax spoken of here 
is, according to Lane's Lexicon, the tax that is taken from the free non-Muslim 
subjects of the Muslim Government whereby they ratify the compact that ensures 
them protection. 

The permission to fight given to Muslims is subject to the condition that the 
enemy should first take up the sword (2:190). The Holy Prophet never over- 
stepped this limit, nor did his followers. He fought against the Arabs when they 
took up the sword to destroy the Muslims, and he led an expedition against the 
Christians when the Roman Empire first mobilized its forces with the object of 
subjugating the Muslims. When he found that the enemy had not yet taken the ini- 
tiative, he did not attack the Roman Empire, but returned without fighting. Later 
on, however, the Roman Empire, like the Persians, fomented trouble against the 
newly established Muslim Kingdom, as a result of which both these empires came 
into conflict with the Muslims and, despite the fact that both the Persians and the 
Romans were very powerful nations with unlimited resources and strong military 
organizations, and that they both tried at the same time to subjugate Islam, the 
result was what is predicted here in clear words — they were both reduced to a 
state of subjection by an insignificant nation like the Arabs. 



9 : 30 • ISLAM WILL TRIUMPH IN THE WORLD 237 

Section 5: Islam will triumph in the World 

30 And the Jews say: Ezra is the son of Allah; a and the Chris- 
tians say: The Messiah is the son of Allah. These are the words of 
their mouths. They imitate the saying of those who disbelieved 
before. Allah's curse be on them! How they are turned away 
(from truth)! 31 They take their doctors of law and their monks for 
lords besides Allah/ and (also) the Messiah, son of Mary. And 
they were enjoined that they should serve one God only — there is 
no god but He. Glory be to Him from what they set up as partners 
(with Him)! 

32 They desire to put out the light of Allah with their mouths, 
but Allah will allow nothing except the perfection of His light, 
though the disbelievers are averse/ 33 He it is Who has sent His 
Messenger with the guidance and the Religion of Truth that He 
may make it prevail over all religions, though those who set up 
partners (with Allah) are averse. e 



a (30-1) It has been shown by Muslim historians that there was a sect among 
the Jews who raised Ezra to the dignity of godhead or son of God. The Quran 
never blames the Jewish nation as a whole for entertaining this belief. However, 
the word son in case of Ezra may have been used here freely as meaning a special 
favourite, in the same way as elsewhere the Quran says of the Jews and the Chris- 
tians that they call themselves the sons of Allah and His beloved ones (5:18). 

b (30-2) We are here told that the Christian doctrine that Jesus Christ was the 
son of God was borrowed from earlier pagan people. Recent research has estab- 
lished the fact beyond all doubt. In fact, when St. Paul saw that the Jews would on 
no account accept Jesus Christ as a messenger of God, he introduced the pagan 
doctrine of sonship of God into the Christian religion, so that it might become 
more acceptable to the pagans. 

c (31) This does not mean that they took them actually for gods; the meaning 
is that they followed them blindly in what they enjoined and what they forbade, 
attaching to them a Divine dignity. Muslims who accord a similar position to their 
ulama, spiritual leaders or saints are guilty of the same error. 

d (32) This is a prophecy of the ultimate triumph of Islam in face of severe 
opposition. All opposition to truth, whether based on force or propaganda, is here 
compared with putting out the Divine light by blowing with the mouth to show 
that all such attempts would prove futile. The Divine light will be made perfect, 
by which is meant the triumph of Islam, as the next verse states clearly. 

e (33) The prophecy of the ultimate triumph of Islam in the whole world is

34 O you who believe, surely many of the doctors of law and 
monks eat away people's property falsely, and hinder (them) from 
Allah's way. And those who hoard up gold and silver and do not 
spend it in Allah's way — announce to them a painful punishment, 
3s on the day when it will be heated in the Fire of hell, then their 
foreheads and their sides and their backs will be branded with it: 
This is what you hoarded up for yourselves, so taste what you 
used to hoard." 

36 Surely the number of months with Allah is twelve months 
by Allah's ordinance, since the day when He created the heavens 
and the earth — of these four are sacred. That is the right religion; 
so do not wrong yourselves in regard to them. And fight the 
idolaters all together as they fight you all together.^ And know that 
Allah is with those who keep their duty. 37 Postponing (of the 
sacred month) is only an addition in disbelief, by which those who 
disbelieve are led astray. They allow it one year and forbid it 
(another) year, that they may agree in the number (of months) 



repeated three times in the Quran, in exactly the same words — here and in 48:28 
and 61:9. In Arabia itself, Islam became triumphant in the lifetime of the Holy 
Prophet. After his death, the first century of the Muslim era saw vast Christian 
communities swelling the ranks of Islam, in Egypt, North Africa, Asia Minor, 
Persia and Central Asia. More amazing was the fact that Islam, coming in contact 
with other great religions, with Zoroastrianism in Persia, with Buddhism and 
Hinduism in India and Afghanistan, and with Confucianism in China, conquered 
the hearts of the followers of every religion and they accepted the message of 
Truth in vast numbers. And the final manifestation of this great prophecy is fore- 
shadowed in the gradual acceptance of the principles of Islam in the whole world 
today, despite the fact that the political power of Islam is at its lowest ebb. 

a (35) The punishment of an evil is spoken of throughout the Quran as simi- 
lar to the evil. Even in this world, a man feels a torment similar to the nature of 
the evil in which he indulges. Being branded with the hoarded wealth is thus a fit 
description of the punishment of the hoarders. 

b (36-1) The allusion here is to the Arab practice of postponing the pilgri- 
mage to a month other than that in which it fell, for which see the next verse. 

c (36-2) Fighting was prohibited in the sacred months (2:217). Excepting 
this, the Muslims were told to fight with the idolaters as the idolaters fought with 
them, i.e. since all idolaters united in fighting with the Muslims, the latter, too, 
should unite in fighting with them. 



9:38' THE TABUK EXPEDITION 239 

which Allah has made sacred, and thus make lawful what Allah 
has forbidden." The evil of their doings is made to seem good to 
them. And Allah does not guide the disbelieving people. 

Section 6: The Tabuk Expedition 

38 O you who believe, what (excuse) have you that when it is 
said to you, Go forth in Allah's way, you should incline heavily to 
earth? Are you contented with this world's life instead of the 
Hereafter? The provision of this world's life is but little as com- 
pared with the Hereafter. 39 If you do not go forth, He will punish 
you with a painful punishment, and bring in your place a people 
other than you, and you can do Him no harm. c And Allah is Power- 
ful over all things. 

40 If you do not help him, Allah certainly helped him when 
those who disbelieved expelled him — he being the second of the 
two; when they were both in the cave, when he said to his com- 
panion: Do not grieve, surely Allah is with us. So Allah sent 



a (37) The reference here is to the practice of postponing observance of the 
sacred month, thus allowing an ordinary month to be observed as sacred and a 
sacred month to be treated as ordinary. This practice interfered with the security 
of life which was guaranteed in the sacred months, and is, therefore, denounced. 

b (38) This refers to the expedition of Tabuk, which was undertaken in the 
middle of 9 A.H. owing to the threatening attitude of the Roman Empire. There 
were many hindrances to the raising of an army sufficient to meet the strong 
forces of the Roman Empire, the main ones being: a great drought, the length of 
the journey to Syria, the ripening of the fruits which were now ready to be 
gathered, the heat, and the organization and power of the Roman army. In spite of 
all these difficulties 30,000 men gathered round the Holy Prophet's banner. 

c (39) The reference here and in what follows is to certain men, who, while 
professing belief, hesitated to accept the Holy Prophet's call to get ready for the 
expedition. 

rf(40) This refers to the Holy Prophet's flight from Makkah, when he was 
forced to hide himself in a cave called Thaur, about three miles from Makkah, 
with only one companion, Abu Bakr, "the second of the two". The believers are 
told that Allah saved the Prophet from the hands of his enemies when he had just 
one companion amidst a whole nation of enemies, and that Allah would help him 
now.

down His tranquillity on him and strengthened him with forces 
which you did not see, and made lowest the word of those who 
disbelieved. And the word of Allah, that is the uppermost. And 
Allah is Mighty, Wise. 

41 Go forth, light and heavy," and strive hard in Allah's way 
with your wealth and your lives. This is better for you, if you know. 
42 If it had been a near gain and a short journey, they would cer- 
tainly have followed you, but the hard journey was too long for 
them. And they will swear by Allah: If we had been able, we 
would have gone forth with you. They cause their own souls to 
perish; and Allah knows that they are liars. 

Section 7: The Hypocrites 

43 Allah pardon youf Why did you permit them until those 
who spoke the truth had become apparent to you and you had 
known the liars? 44 Those who believe in Allah and the Last Day 
do not ask permission from you (to stay away) from striving hard 
with their wealth and their persons. And Allah is Knower of those 
who keep their duty. 45 They alone ask permission from you who 
do not believe in Allah and the Last Day, and their hearts are in 
doubt, so in their doubt they waver. 46 And if they had intended to 
go forth, they would certainly have provided equipment for it; but 
Allah did not like their going forth. So He withheld them, and it 
was said: Hold back with those who hold back. 47 If they had gone 



a (41) That is, whether it is easy or difficult for you to proceed or whether 
you are sufficiently armed or not. 

b (42) Tabuk was midway between Madinah and Damascus. The Arabs were 
accustomed to fighting near home; hence, the distance was one of the chief consi- 
derations which held back those who were insincere. 

c (43) This expression does not convey the significance of pardon of sins; it 
is rather the equivalent of Allah bless you! or may Allah set your affairs aright! In 
previous battles, too, the hypocrites always stayed away, offering one excuse or 
another. But the Divine purpose in this last expedition of the Holy Prophet was to 
bring about a clear distinction, and to clean the Muslim society of the hypocritical 
element thoroughly. Such a distinction was really brought about later on as verses 
83-84 point out. 



9 : 48 • THE HYPOCRITES 241 

forth with you, they would have added to you nothing but trouble, 
and would have hurried to and fro among you seeking (to sow) 
dissension among you. And among you there are those who would 
listen to them. And Allah well knows the wrongdoers. 48 Certainly 
they sought (to sow) dissension before, and they devised plots 
against you till the Truth came, and Allah's command prevailed, 
though they did not like (it). 

49 And among them is he who says: Excuse me and do not try 
me. Surely into trial have they already fallen, and truly hell en- 
compasses the disbelievers. 50 If good befalls you, it grieves them; 
and if hardship afflicts you, they say: Indeed we had taken care of 
our affair before. And they turn away rejoicing. 51 Say: Nothing 
will afflict us except what Allah has ordained for us. He is our 
Patron; and on Allah let the believers rely. 52 Say: Do you await for 
us but one of two most excellent things? a And we await for you 
that Allah will afflict you with punishment from Himself or by our 
hands. So wait; we too are waiting with you. 

53 Say: Spend willingly or unwillingly, it will not be accepted 
from you. Surely you are a transgressing people. 54 And nothing 
hinders their contributions being accepted from them, except that 
they disbelieve in Allah and in His Messenger and they do not 
come to prayer except as lazy people, nor do they spend (on good 
works) but reluctantly. 55 Do not, then, let their wealth nor their 
children excite your admiration. Allah only wishes to punish them 
by means of these in this world's life and (that) their souls may 
depart while they are disbelievers. c 56 And they swear by Allah that 



a (52-1) The two most excellent things are: the laying down of life in the 
cause of Truth, or being sharer in the ultimate triumph of Truth. 

b (52-2) The only punishment that the hypocrites received from the hands of 
the Muslims was that they were named and asked to leave the mosque. Otherwise 
their liberty was not interfered with. See also the next verse. 

c (55) The hypocrites experienced earthly torture about their property and 
children for two reasons: (1) because, avowing their belief in Islam, they had to 
take some share in its defensive expeditions and thus spend part of their property, 
unwillingly though it was, in the cause of Islam; (2) the children of many of them 
were true believers, and they knew that after their death their property and their 



242 9. THE IMMUNITY • 9 : 57 

they are truly of you. And they are not of you, but they are a people 
who are afraid. 57 If they could find a refuge or caves or a place to 
enter, they would certainly have turned to it, running away in all 
haste. 

58 And some of them blame you in the matter of the (distribu- 
tion of) charity. So if they are given out of it, they are pleased, and 
if they are not given out of it, lo! they are enraged. 59 And (better it 
would be) if they were content with what Allah and His Messen- 
ger gave them, and had said: Allah is sufficient for us, Allah will 
soon give us (more) out of His grace and His Messenger too — 
surely to Allah we make petition. 

Section 8: The Hypocrites 

60 (The due) charity a is only for the poor and the needy, and 
those employed to administer it, and those whose hearts are made 
to incline (to truth), and (to free) the captives, and those in debt, 
and in the way of Allah and for the traveller — an ordinance from 
Allah. And Allah is Knowing, Wise. 



children were to become a source of strength to the very religion which they tried 
to extirpate. 

a (60-1) The word sadaqat, used here for charity, refers in this verse to the 
obligatory charity called zakat, and not to voluntary alms which is its common 
meaning. This is shown by the concluding words of the verse, which call it an 
ordinance from Allah. 

b (60-2) The verse defines the objects for which the zakat or due charity may 
be spent. Eight heads of expenditure are recognized. There are the poor, or those 
in difficult circumstances. Then there are the needy, by which are meant people 
who need some help to enable them to earn their living; poor students and crafts- 
men or business men without sufficient means are included in this category. 
Thirdly, there are the collectors of zakat and other people employed to administer 
the funds. This shows that the institution was meant for raising a public fund, 
whose management should entirely be in the hands of a public body. In the fourth 
class are people whose hearts are made to incline to Truth — carrying the 
message of Truth to them needs funds, and there are also people who may need 
help if they accept the Truth. The fifth head relates to the freeing of the prisoners 
of war. Islam thus laid down a permanent basis for the abolition of slavery. The 
sixth class is that of debtors — people who incur debts for right purposes. Squan- 
derers of wealth are, however, not included in this category. The seventh head is 



9 : 61 • THE HYPOCRITES 243 

61 And some of them molest the Prophet and say, He is (all) 
ear." Say: A hearer of good for you — he believes in Allah and 
believes the faithful, and is a mercy for those of you who believe. 
And those who molest the Messenger of Allah, for them is a pain- 
ful punishment. 62 They swear by Allah to you to please you; and 
Allah — as well as His Messenger — has a greater right that they 
should please Him, if they are believers. 63 Do they not know that 
whoever opposes Allah and His Messenger, for him is the Fire of 
hell to abide in it? That is the grievous disgrace. 

64 The hypocrites fear that a chapter may be sent down con- 
cerning them, telling them plainly of what is in their hearts. Say: 
Go on mocking, surely Allah will bring to light what you fear. 
65 And if you ask them, they would certainly say: We were only 
talking idly and sporting. Say: Was it Allah and His messages and 
His Messenger that you mocked? 66 Make no excuse, you dis- 
believed after your believing. If We pardon some of you, We shall 
punish others because they are guilty. c 

Section 9: The Hypocrites 

67 The hypocrites, men and women, are all alike. They enjoin 
evil and forbid good and withhold their hands. They have forsaken 
Allah, so He has forsaken them. Surely the hypocrites are the 
transgressors. 68 AUah promises the hypocrites, men and women, 
and the disbelievers the Fire of hell to abide in it. It is enough 

in general words "in the way of Allah". This would include those fighting in 
defence of faith and the community, or those engaged in propagating Islamic 
truths, but the words may be taken generally and include every charitable purpose. 
The eighth head is that of travellers, people who are stranded in a country, to what- 
ever religion or nation they may belong. 

a (61) The hypocrites made various derogatory remarks concerning the Holy 
Prophet, saying among other things, that he was a man who believed everything 
that he heard, and they were therefore sure that they would make him believe their 
hypocritical professions. 

b (62) Though Allah and His Messenger are both mentioned together, the 
duty of the faithful is here said to be to please Him, i.e. Allah alone. 

c (66) History shows that most of the hypocrites ultimately repented and 
sincerely joined the ranks of the faithful. 



244 9. THE IMMUNITY • 9 : 69 

for them. And Allah curses them, and for them is a lasting punish- 
ment. 69 Like those before you — they were stronger than you in 
power and had more wealth and children. So they enjoyed their 
portion; thus have you enjoyed your portion as those before you 
enjoyed their portion, and you indulge in idle talk as they did. 
These are they whose deeds are fruitless in this world and the Here- 
after, and these are they who are the losers. 

70 Has not the story reached them of those before them — of 
the people of Noah and Ad and Thamud, and the people of 
Abraham and the dwellers of Midian and the overthrown cities? 
Their messengers came to them with clear arguments. So Allah did 
not wrong them but they wronged themselves. 

71 And the believers, men and women, are friends of one 
another. They enjoin good and forbid evil and keep up prayer and 
give the due charity, and obey Allah and His Messenger. As for 
these, Allah will have mercy on them. Surely Allah is Mighty, 
Wise. 72 Allah has promised to the believers, men and women, 
Gardens, in which rivers flow, to abide in them, and goodly dwell- 
ings in Gardens of perpetual abode. And greatest of all is Allah's 
goodly pleasure. That is the mighty achievement. 

Section 10: The Hypocrites 

73 O Prophet, strive hard against the disbelievers and the 
hypocrites and be firm against them." And their abode is hell, and 
evil is the destination. 74 They swear by Allah that they said nothing. 
And certainly they did speak the word of disbelief, and dis- 
believed after their Islam, and they aimed (to do) what they could 



a (73) Jihad signifies striving hard. It is in a secondary sense that the word 
signifies fighting, and it is repeatedly used in the Quran in its primary signifi- 
cance. It is a fact that those who professed Islam insincerely were never fought 
against by the Muslims — as on this occasion and on the occasion of the battle of 
Uhud. The Holy Prophet is commanded here to carry on a jihad against dis- 
believers as well as hypocrites. Hence the only significance that can be attached to 
these words is that he must continue to exert himself hard in preaching both to the 
disbelievers and the hypocrites. 



9 : 75 • THE HYPOCRITES 245 

not attain. And they sought revenge only because Allah — as 
well as His Messenger — had enriched them out of His grace. So 
if they repent, it will be good for them; and if they turn away, 
Allah will punish them with a painful punishment in this world 
and the Hereafter; and they shall have in the earth neither a friend 
nor a helper. 

75 And some of them made a covenant with Allah: If He give 
us out of His grace, we will certainly give in charity and be of the 
righteous. 76 But when He gave them out of His grace, they 
became miserly with it and they turned away and they are averse. 
77 So He repaid them with hypocrisy in their hearts till the day 
when they meet Him, because they broke their promise with Allah 
and because they lied. 78 Do they not know that Allah knows their 
hidden thoughts and their secret counsels, and that Allah is the 
great Knower of the unseen things? 

79 Those who taunt the free givers of charity among the 
believers as well as those who cannot find anything (to give) but 
with their hard labour — they scoff at them. Allah will pay them 
back their mockery; and for them is a painful punishment/ 80 Ask 
forgiveness for them or do not ask forgiveness for them. Even if 
you ask forgiveness for them seventy times, Allah will not forgive 
them. This is because they disbelieve in Allah and His Messenger. 
And Allah does not guide the transgressing people. 



a (74-1) They did their best to put an end to the life of the Holy Prophet and 
bring about the extirpation of Islam. 

b (74-2) The advent of the Muslims in Madinah had enriched its inhabitants. 
Was it not, then, a matter for wonder that those men who had gained by Islam 
should turn against their very benefactors? 

c (79) When subscriptions were raised for the expedition to Tabuk, the 
wealthier members of the Muslim community gave large donations, while the 
poorer ones, the labourers, also paid their mite out of their hard earnings. The 
hypocrites taunted both, the former as making a show of their wealth, the latter as 
bringing in their small subscriptions only to be counted among the subscribers. 

d (80) Spiritual relations with the hypocrites were henceforth cut off. The 
mention of seventy may not indicate the specific number here. When Abdullah ibn 
Ubayy, the recognized leader of the hypocrites, died, the Holy Prophet was asked 



246 9. THE IMMUNITY • 9 : 81 

Section 1 1 : The Hypocrites 

81 Those who were left behind were glad on account of their 
remaining behind Allah's Messenger, and they disliked to strive in 
Allah's way with their property and their persons, and said: Do 
not go forth in the heat. Say: The Fire of hell is fiercer in heat. If 
only they could understand! 82 Then let them laugh a little and weep 
much — a recompense for what they earned. 83 So if Allah bring 
you back to some of them, then they ask your permission to go 
forth, say: Never shall you go forth with me and never shall you 
fight an enemy with me. You chose to sit (at home) the first time, 
so sit (now) with those who remain behind." 

84 And never offer prayer for anyone of them who dies, nor 
stand by his grave. Surely they disbelieved in Allah and His 
Messenger and they died in transgression. 85 And do not let their 

to conduct the burial service. The Holy Prophet got up, but Umar objected on the 
ground that Abdullah was a hypocrite, and referred to his hostile attitude through- 
out his life. The Holy Prophet replied that Allah had given him a choice (referring 
to the words of this verse: Ask forgiveness for them or do not ask forgiveness for 
them), and that he would ask forgiveness for him for over seventy times, so that 
forgiveness could be extended to the dead man. Then he offered prayers for him. 
Verse 84 is said to have been revealed then to stop the offering of prayers for those 
who were known to be hypocrites (Bukhari, 23:84). 

The incident shows how kind and forgiving the Holy Prophet was to his 
severest enemies. Abdullah ibn Ubayy was the man who had led the hypocrite 
movement against him, and thus was not only one of his worst enemies, but a 
most dangerous one, because he was aware of all the movements of the Muslims 
and deceived them at the most critical moments. Yet the Holy Prophet forgave 
him entirely. 

a (83) This is the only punishment given to the hypocrites, namely, that they 
were not allowed to take part in future expeditions against the enemies of the 
Muslims. It is also related that from one of them the Holy Prophet and the three 
Caliphs who followed him refused to accept the zakat. These were the only dis- 
advantages, if it is right to call them so, which the hypocrites suffered. They were 
not looked upon as members of the Muslim community, but as citizens they 
enjoyed all the rights of other citizens. 

b (84) The Prophet is now told that, though they professed Islam outwardly, 
they were disbelievers at heart, and the burial service, which was only for Mus- 
lims, should not be extended to them. But it was through Divine revelation that 
the Prophet learnt that they were really disbelievers. It is, further, clear from these 



9 : 86 • THE HYPOCRITES 247 

wealth and their children excite jour admiration. Allah only intends 
to punish them thereby in this world, and (that) their souls may 
depart while they are disbelievers. 

86 And when a chapter is revealed, saying, Believe in Allah 
and strive hard along with His Messenger, the wealthy among them 
ask permission of you and say: Leave us (behind), that we may be 
with those who sit (at home). 87 They prefer to be with those who 
remain behind, and their hearts are sealed so they do not under- 
stand. 88 But the Messenger and those who believe with him strive 
hard with their property and their persons. And these it is for whom 
are the good things and these it is who are successful. 89 Allah has 
prepared for them Gardens in which rivers flow, to abide therein. 
That is the mighty achievement. 

Section 12: The Hypocrites 

90 And the defaulters from among the dwellers of the desert 
came that permission might be given to them, and they sat (at 
home) who lied to Allah and His Messenger. A painful punish- 
ment will afflict those of them who disbelieve. 91 No blame lies on 
the weak, nor on the sick, nor on those who can find nothing to 
spend, if they are sincere to Allah and His Messenger. There is no 
way (to blame) against the doers of good. And Allah is Forgiving, 
Merciful — 92 nor on those to whom, when they came to you that 
you should carry them, you said: I cannot find anything on which 
to carry you." They went back, their eyes overflowing with tears 
of grief that they could not find anything to spend. 93 The way (to 
blame) is only against those who ask permission of you, though 
they are rich. They have chosen to be with those who remained 
behind; and Allah has sealed their hearts, so they do not know. 

words that those who were known to be hypocrites were not fought against but 
lived to die a natural death. There is not a single case on record of any one of 
them having been put to death. Standing by the grave refers to the Holy Prophet's 
practice of praying for the deceased standing by his grave after the burial. 

a (92) What they wanted in order to join the expedition, and what the Holy 
Prophet could not find for them, were beasts on which they should be carried, 
along with their provisions and necessaries. See also 19:27 footnote 1.

94 They will make excuses to you when you return to them. 
Say: Make no excuse, we shall not believe you; Allah has informed 
us of matters relating to you. And Allah and His Messenger will 
now see your actions, then you will be brought back to the 
Knower of the unseen and the seen, then He will inform you of 
what you did." 95 They will swear by Allah to you, when you return 
to them, so that you may leave them alone. So leave them alone. 
Surely they are unclean and their refuge is hell — a recompense 
for what they earned. 96 They will swear to you that you may be 
pleased with them. But if you are pleased with them, yet surely 
Allah is not pleased with the transgressing people. 

97 The dwellers of the desert are hardest in disbelief and hypo- 
crisy, and most disposed not to know the limits of what Allah has 
revealed to His Messenger. And Allah is Knowing, Wise. 98 And 
some of the dwellers of the desert take what they spend to be a 
fine, e and they wait for an evil turn of fortune for you. On them is 
the evil turn. And Allah is Hearing, Knowing. "And some of the 
dwellers of the desert believe in Allah and the Last Day, and 
consider what they spend and the prayers of the Messenger as 
bringing them nearer to Allah. Surely they bring them nearer (to 
Allah); Allah will admit them into His mercy. Surely Allah is 
Forgiving, Merciful.

a (94) Evidently these verses were revealed when the Holy Prophet was 
away from Madinah, and the statements made in them are therefore prophetical, 
being exactly fulfilled on his return.

any relations with the hypocrites. 

c (98) The hypocrites had to contribute something for the sake of appear- 
ance; they also paid the zakat so that they might be treated as Muslims. 

d (100) In the history of Islam, the word 'Emigrants' (muhajirin) came to 
signify all those Companions of the Holy Prophet who, having embraced Islam at

dwellers of the desert around you are hypocrites; and some of the 
people of Madinah (also) — they persist in hypocrisy. Fou do not 
know them; We know them. a We will punish them twice, then 
they will be turned back to a severe punishment. 

102 And others have acknowledged their faults — they mixed 
a good deed with another that was evil. It may be that Allah will 
turn to them (mercifully). Surely Allah is Forgiving, Merciful. e

servants and takes the charity, and that Allah — He is the Oft-

will see your work and (so will) His Messenger and the believers. 
And you will be brought back to the Knower of the unseen and the

Makkah, had to flee from their homes either to Abyssinia (present day Ethiopia) 
or to Madinah. The latter flight, including nearly all the Muslims of Makkah, is 
known as the Hijra or Flight, and the Muslim era dates from it. The word 
'Helpers' (Ansar) signifies the Muslims of Madinah who, having accepted Islam 
before the Flight, gave shelter to those who fled from Makkah. By "those who 
followed them in goodness" are meant the Muslims who came after the Com- 
panions and followed their good deeds. 

a (101-1) The insincerity of the heart could not be known to a mortal — it is 
known only to Allah. 

b (101-2) The hypocrites were punished twice in this life. They had to take 
part in all contributions for the defence of the Muslim community and had to pay 
the zakat, all this against their conviction and unwillingly. After having suffered 
all this torment for the sake of being reckoned Muslims, they were ultimately 
separated from the Muslims, and this exposure to public shame was no doubt a 
great punishment for them. 

c (102) According to different reports, the number of these men varied from 
three to ten. They were sincere and acknowledged their fault. 

d (103) Because they showed sincerity in confessing their faults, they were 
dealt with leniently. Their charity was not to be rejected.

turn to them (mercifully). And Allah is Knowing, Wise." 

107 And those who built a mosque to cause harm (to Islam) 
and (to help) disbelief, and to cause disunion among the believers, 
and a refuge for him who made war against Allah and His Messen- 
ger before. And they will certainly swear: We desired nothing but 
good. And Allah bears witness that they are certainly liars. 108 Never 
stand in it. Certainly a mosque founded on observance of duty from 
the first day is more deserving that you should stand in it. In it are 
men who love to purify themselves. And Allah loves those who 
purify themselves/ 109 Is he, then, who lays his foundation on duty 
to Allah and (His) good pleasure better, or he who lays his founda- 
tion on the edge of a cracking hollowed bank, so it broke down 
with him into the Fire of hell? And Allah does not guide the unjust 
people. 110 The building which they have built will ever continue to 
be a source of disquiet in their hearts, unless their hearts be torn to 
pieces. And Allah is Knowing, Wise. 

Section 14: The Faithful 

111 Surely Allah has bought from the believers their persons 
and their property — theirs (in return) is the Garden. They fight in 
Allah's way, so they kill and are killed. It is a promise which is 



a (106) This is generally supposed to refer to three of the believers who held 
back from the expedition (Bukhari, 64:81). 

b (107) Some hypocrites built a mosque at the instigation of Abu Amir, with 
the object of causing harm to that mosque. Abu Amir, who after fighting against 
the Holy Prophet for a long time, had fled to Syria after the battle of Hunain, had 
written to his friends at Madinah that he was coming with a formidable army to 
crush the Prophet, and that they should build a mosque for him. But Abu Amir 
died in Syria, and the founders desired the Holy Prophet to give it a blessing by 
his presence, which he was forbidden to do by Divine revelation, and the mosque 
was demolished. 

c (108) The words are general and every mosque raised for the service of 
Allah may be included in this description. 

rf(110) Their hearts could be torn to pieces by severe regret or by sincere 
repentance.

binding on Him in the Torah and the Gospel and the Quran." And 
who is more faithful to his promise than Allah? Rejoice therefore 
in your bargain which you have made. And that is the mighty 
achievement. 112 They who turn (to Allah), who serve (Him), who 
praise (Him), who fast, who bow down, who prostrate themselves, 
who enjoin what is good and forbid what is evil, and who keep the 
limits of Allah — and give good news to the believers. 

113 It is not for the Prophet and those who believe to ask for- 
giveness for those who set up partners (with Allah), even though 
they should be near relatives, after it has become clear to them 
that they are companions of the flaming fire. 114 And Abraham's 



a (111) The promise binding on Allah is that Allah will grant the believers 
His blessings, if they exert themselves with their persons and their property in His 
way. The Gospels give the same promise: "If you want to be perfect", said Jesus 
to a wealthy man, "go, sell what you have and give to the poor, and you will have 
treasure in heaven; and come, follow me" (Matthew, 19:21). To Peter he said: 
"everyone who has left houses or brothers or sisters or father or mother or wife or 
children or lands, for my name's sake, shall receive a hundredfold, and inherit 
eternal life" (Matthew, 19:29). Moses' teaching contains similar promises. For 
instance, the promise of "a land flowing with milk and honey" is made condi- 
tional on "You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your 
soul, and with all your strength" (Deuteronomy, 6:3-5), which is the same as 
exerting oneself to the utmost in the way of God with one's person and property. 

It should be borne in mind that the words, they fight in Allah 's way, so they 
kill and are killed, are not a part of the promise, but are expressive of the condi- 
tion of the Companions, and show that they were true to their promise. The 
promise to spend one's person and property may be carried out in various ways 
under different circumstances, and the Companions of the Holy Prophet were as 
true to this promise during the thirteen years at Makkah as during the ten years at 
Madinah. 

b (113) This verse does not prohibit praying for the forgiveness of the dis- 
believers in general, but only such disbelievers about whom it became clear that 
they were doomed to the Fire. When the Holy Prophet was asked to pray for the 
destruction of a people who were fighting against him, he prayed thus: "My Lord, 
forgive them because they do not know". So long as a man is alive, however hard 
he may be in his disbelief, it is not forbidden to pray for his forgiveness or gui- 
dance. But when he is dead, God will deal with him as He pleases, and He is the 
most Merciful of all merciful ones. According to a hadith, after all intercessions 
have taken place, the most Merciful of all will take a handful — and the handful 
with God is as vast as the heavens and the earth (39:67) — out of hell and throw 



252 9. THE IMMUNITY '9:115 

asking forgiveness for his sire was only owing to a promise which 
he had made to him; but when it became clear to him that he was 
an enemy of Allah, he dissociated himself from him. Surely Abra- 
ham was tender-hearted, forbearing. 115 And it is not (attributable 
to) Allah that He should lead a people astray after He has guided 
them, so far so that He makes clear to them what they should 
guard against." Surely Allah is Knower of all things. 116 Surely 
Allah's is the kingdom of the heavens and the earth. He gives life 
and causes death. And besides Allah you have no friend nor 
helper. 

117 Certainly Allah has turned in mercy to the Prophet and 
the Emigrants and the Helpers who followed him in the hour of 
hardship, after the hearts of a group of them were about to deviate; 
then He turned to them in mercy. Surely to them He is Com- 
passionate, Merciful; 118 and (He turned in mercy) to the three who 
were left behind; until the earth, vast as it is, became narrow to 
them and their souls were also narrowed to them; and they knew 
that there was no refuge from Allah but in Him. Then He turned to 
them in mercy that they might turn (to Him). Surely Allah — He 
is the Oft-returning to mercy, the Merciful/ 

them into the river of Life, and these would be the people who never did any good 
(Bukhari 98:24). But under this verse the burial service, which is a prayer for 
forgiveness, is held only for Muslims, and not for those who die in disbelief. 

a (115) This verse establishes in clear words that Allah never leads a people 
astray; and how could He lead astray, says the Quran, when He it is Who gives 
them guidance, and makes clear to them the evils they should guard against? 

b (117) Taubah on the part of Allah means His turning to His servant and 
changing one state to another which is higher than it. Allah's turning mercifully is 
in relation to the Prophet and those sincere believers who are plainly stated to 
have followed the Prophet in the hour of difficulty. The group whose hearts were 
about to deviate is referred to in the next verse. 

c (118) These were three men from among the Ansar, referred to in v. 106. 
The words were left behind may mean left behind with respect to the command- 
ment of Allah concerning them, as v. 106 speaks of them as being "made to await 
Allah's command". They remained cut off from all relations with the Muslims for 
fifty days. Ka'b ibn Malik, one of the three men, was a man of importance, and 
when he received a letter from the king of Ghassan, offering him a position under 
him if he deserted the Prophet, he burned the letter, showing his contempt for the 
offer, and gave no reply. 



9:119' THE FAITHFUL 253 

Section 15: What the Faithful should do 

119 O you who believe, keep your duty to Allah and be with 
the truthful. 120 It was not proper for the people of Madinah and 
those round about them of the dwellers of the desert to remain 
behind the Messenger of Allah, nor to prefer their own lives to his 
life." That is because neither thirst nor fatigue nor hunger afflicts 
them in Allah's way, nor do they tread a path which enrages the 
disbelievers, nor do they cause any harm to an enemy, but a good 
work is written down for them on account of it. Surely Allah does 
not waste the reward of the doers of good; 121 nor do they spend 
anything, small or great, nor do they traverse a valley but it is 
written down for them, that Allah may reward them for the best of 
what they did. 

122 And the believers should not go forth all together. Why, 
then, does not a group from every party from among them go forth 
that they may apply themselves to obtain understanding in religion, 
and that they may warn their people when they come back to them, 
that they may be cautious? 

Section 16: The Prophet's Great Anxiety 

123 O you who believe, fight those of the disbelievers who are 
near to you and let them find firmness in you. c And know that Allah 
is with those who keep their duty. 124 And whenever a chapter is 
revealed, there are some of them who say: Which of you has it 
strengthened in faith? So as for those who believe, it strengthens 



a (120) The meaning is that they should neither desire rest for themselves, 
nor comfort, nor protection, in preference to the Prophet; in other words, they 
should accompany him in difficulty and distress. 

b (122) In the midst of the ordinances relating to fighting, the Quran intro- 
duces the subject of the preparation of a missionary force, thus showing that this 
was the greatest necessity of Islam. It was only by means of a missionary effort 
that truth could be spread, and the ultimate object was not to be lost sight of, even 
when the community was engaged in a life-and-death struggle against over- 
whelming forces of the enemy. 

c (123) Because it was those who were near who persecuted the Muslims. 
The object was to stop persecution. Muslims must be firm and not yield to them.

them in faith and they rejoice. 125 And as for those in whose hearts 
is a disease, it adds uncleanness to their uncleanness, and they die 
while they are disbelievers." 126 Do they not see that they are tried 
once or twice in every year, yet they do not repent, nor do they 
become mindful. 127 And whenever a chapter is revealed, they 
look at one another: Does anyone see you? Then they turn away. 
Allah has turned away their hearts because they are a people who 
do not understand. 

128 Certainly a Messenger has come to you from among 
yourselves; very painful for him is your falling into distress, most 
concerned (he is) for you, to the believers (he is) compassionate, 
merciful. c 129 But if they turn away, say: Allah is sufficient for me 
— there is no god but He. On Him do I rely, and He is the Lord of 
the mighty Throne. 



a (125) The uncleanness of their hearts increased with new revelation, 
because it increased them in stubbornness, and their hearts were more and more 
hardened against truth. See also 71:6 footnote. 

b (126) These trials consisted of the expeditions which the Muslims had to 
undertake every now and then, and in which the hypocrites were distinguished from 
the true believers. 

c (128) This is the true picture of the heart which grieved, not for his 
followers alone, not for one nation or country, but for all humanity. He grieves for 
the burdens of all, and he is most concerned for the welfare of all. The whole of 
humanity is meant here because the concluding words refer additionally to the 
believers. There is a special relation he bears to those who follow him; to them he 
is, in addition, compassionate and merciful. 



Chapter 10 
Yunus Jonah 

This chapter makes a brief reference to the Prophet Jonah (v. 98), which gives 
it its title, to indicate that as the people of Jonah benefited by his warning, so 
would the Arabs ultimately believe in the Prophet Muhammad. While this 
chapter asserts the truth of revelation, it also lays stress on the merciful deal- 
ing of God with mankind. It tells us that He does not send punishment quickly 
and that evidence of His mercy is also found in nature. It also refers to the 
histories of Noah and Moses. This chapter was revealed during the last four 
years of the Makkan period of the Holy Prophet's life. 



Section 1 : Truth of Revelation 

In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful. 

1 I, Allah, am the Seer." These are the verses of the Book, full 
of wisdom. 2 Is it a wonder to the people that We have revealed 
to a man from among themselves: Warn the people and give good 
news to those who believe that for them is advancement in 
excellence c with their Lord? The disbelievers say: This is surely 
an obvious enchanter. 

3 Surely your Lord is Allah, Who created the heavens and the 
earth in six periods, and He is established on the Throne of Power 



a (1-1) Alif, lam, ra are the three letters which stand at the head of this 
chapter and chapters 11, 12, 14 and 15, while chapter 13 has alif, lam, mim, ra. 
The abbreviation is of the same form as alif, lam, mim (see 2:1 footnote), except 
that ra stands for Ra ';', meaning the Seer, or ara, meaning / see. 

Chapters 10 to 16 all belong to the last four years of the Holy Prophet's life 
at Makkah, and deal with the truth of prophethood with more or less reference to 
the histories of the earlier prophets, four of them being named after a prophet. 

b (1-2) The Book, i.e. the Quran, is called hakim, meaning wise or full of 
wisdom, because it possesses the quality which discriminates between truth and 
falsehood and right and wrong, and because it is free from all unsoundness.

footing of firmness.

mission. This is Allah, your Lord, therefore serve Him. Will you 
not be mindful? 4 To Him is your return, of all (of you). It is the 
promise of Allah (made) in truth. Surely He produces the first 
creation, then He reproduces it, that He may reward with equity 
those who believe and do good. And as for those who disbelieve, 
for them is a drink of hot water and a painful punishment because 
they disbelieved. 

5 He it is Who made the sun a shining brightness, and the 
moon a light, and ordained for it stages that you might know the 
computation of years and the reckoning. Allah did not create this 
but with truth. He makes the signs clear for a people who know. 
6 Surely in the alternation of the night and the day, and what Allah 
has created in the heavens and the earth, there are signs for a people 
who keep their duty. c 

7 Those who do not expect the meeting with Us, and are plea- 
sed with this world's life and are satisfied with it, and those who 
are heedless of Our messages — 8 these, their abode is the Fire 
because of what they earned. 9 Those who believe and do good, 
their Lord guides them by their faith; rivers will flow beneath 
them in Gardens of bliss. i°Their cry therein will be, Glory be to 
You, O Allah! and their greeting, Peace! And the last of their cry 
will be: Praise be to Allah, the Lord of the worlds \ c 



a (3) For creation in six periods and the Throne of Power, see footnotes 
under 7:54. In regulating the Affair, there is a further reference to the spiritual 
evolution of man, as stated more clearly elsewhere: "He orders (or regulates) the 
Affair from the heaven to the earth" (32:5). For intercession, see 2:255 footnote 1. 

b (5) The moon is here called mir because its light is borrowed, as contrasted 
with the sun which is called here diycC. 

c (6) The whole of creation is, despite its variety, subject to one law, and 
clearly bears witness to the unity of its Maker. And just as the visible universe is 
subject to law, there is also a law working in the spiritual world. 

d (9) The light of faith, which is even in this life a guiding principle of man's 
actions, will assume a more palpable form in the life after death. Compare 57:12, 
where it is called the light running, or gleaming, before them.

10:11* PUNISHMENT OF REJECTION 257 

Section 2: Punishment of Rejection 

11 And if Allah were to hasten for people the (consequences 
of) evil, as they would hasten on the good, their doom would cer- 
tainly have been decreed for them. But We leave those alone, who 
have no hope of meeting with Us, in their inordinacy, blindly 
wandering on. a 12 And when affliction touches man, he calls on 
Us, whether lying on his side or sitting or standing; but, when We 
remove his affliction from him, he passes on as though he had 
never called on Us on account of an affliction that touched him. 
Thus what they do is made to seem good to the extravagant. 13 And 
certainly We destroyed generations before you when they did 
wrong, and their messengers came to them with clear arguments, 
yet they would not believe. Thus do We recompense the guilty 
people. 14 Then We made you rulers in the land after them, so that 
We might see how you act. 

15 And when Our clear messages are recited to them, those 
who have no hope of meeting with Us say: Bring a Quran other 
than this or change it. Say: It is not for me to change it of my own 
accord. I follow only what is revealed to me. Indeed I fear, if I 
disobey my Lord, the punishment of a terrible day. c 16 Say: If Allah 
had desired, I would not have recited it to you, nor would He have 
made it known to you. I have lived among you a lifetime before it. 
Do you not then understand? 17 Who is then more unjust than he 

the allegation that the Muslim concept of paradise is characterized by sensuality. 

a (11) People desire and pray for good things to be hastened on to them, and 
they are hastened on, but in His merciful dealing God does not hasten on the con- 
sequences of evil, so that people may repent and escape those consequences. 

b (15-1) They desire a revelation which should not condemn their evil ways 
and their idol- worship, nor contain any threats of their coming doom. 

c (15-2) These words show how true the Holy Prophet himself was to reve- 
lation, translating every one of its precepts into practice. 

rf(16) The Holy Prophet's truthfulness and honesty before he received the 
Divine revelation were undisputed, and he had earned such renown for these 
qualities that he was known as al-Amin, i.e. the Faithful one, or the Truthful one. 
If, as they admitted, he had never told a lie in his lifetime, even for the sake of a 
personal advantage, how could he, now that he had passed the age of youth, speak 
falsely, and that to his own detriment? He was not the gainer, but a sufferer thereby, 



258 10. JONAH -10:18 

who forges a lie against Allah or calls His messages a lie? Surely 
the guilty never succeed. 

18 And they serve besides Allah that which can neither harm 
them nor benefit them, and they say: These are our intercessors 
with Allah. Say: Would you inform Allah of what He does not 
know in the heavens and the earth? Glory be to Him, and supremely 
exalted is He above what they set up as partners (with Him)! 
19 And (all) people are but a single nation, then they disagree. And 
if a word had not already gone forth from your Lord, the matter 
would have certainly been decided between them regarding that in 
which they disagree." 20 And they say: Why is not a sign sent to 
him from his Lord? Say: The unseen is only for Allah, so wait; I 
too am waiting along with you. 

Section 3: Merciful Dealing 

21 And when We make people taste of mercy after an afflic- 
tion touches them, lo! they devise plans against Our messages. 
Say: Allah is quicker to plan. Surely Our messengers write down 
what you plan. 22 He it is Who makes you travel by land and sea; 
until, when you are in the ships, and they sail on with them in a 
pleasant breeze, and they rejoice at it, a violent wind overtakes 
them and waves surge in on them from all sides, and they think 
they are surrounded. Then they pray to Allah, being sincere to 
Him in obedience: If You deliver us from this, we will certainly 



on account of the persecution which his preaching had brought about for him. 
Moreover, a man who had so long refrained from showing any interest in their 
lives and their modes of worship, and had all but lived the silent life of a recluse 
among them, could not, of his own accord, be imagined to have suddenly changed 
the course of his life. 

a (19) The word that had gone forth is referred to in many places: "And they 
say: When will this promise come to pass, if you are truthful? Say: Maybe some- 
thing of what you seek to hasten has drawn near to you" (27:71-72). And again: 
"Say: You have the appointment of a day which you cannot postpone by an hour, 
nor bring it forward" (34:30). 

b (20) It is clear from the context that their demand is for the punishment 
with which they are threatened, because they would recognize no other sign; they 
are told to wait for the sign which would undoubtedly come. 



10 : 23 • MERCIFUL DEALING 259 

be from among the grateful ones. 23 But when He delivers them, lo! 
they are unjustly rebellious in the earth. O people, your rebellion is 
against yourselves — a provision (only) of this world's life. Then 
to Us is your return, so We shall inform you of what you did. 

24 The likeness of this world's life is only as water which We 
send down from the clouds, then the vegetation of the earth, of 
which people and cattle eat, grows luxuriantly thereby; until when 
the earth puts on its golden attire and it becomes adorned, and its 
people think that they are masters of it, Our command comes to it, 
by night or by day, so We render it as reaped seed-produce, as 
though it had not flourished yesterday. Thus do We make clear the 
messages for a people who reflect. 

25 And Allah invites to the abode of peace, and guides whom 
He pleases to the right path. a 26 For those who do good is good 
(reward) and more (than this). Neither darkness nor disgrace will 
cover their faces. These are the owners of the Garden; in it they 
will abide. 27 And those who earn evil, the punishment of an evil is 
the like of it, and humiliation will cover them — they will have 
none to protect them from Allah — as if their faces had been 
covered with slices of the dense darkness of night. These are the 
companions of the Fire; in it they will abide. 

28 And on the day when We gather them all together, then 
We shall say to those who set up partners (with Allah): Stay where 
you are, you and your associate-gods. Then We shall separate 
them from one another, and their associate-gods will say: It was 
not us that you served. 29 So Allah is sufficient as a witness between 



a (25) This is another description of the Muslim paradise, which is called 
dar al-salam, or the abode of peace. The word salam in dar al-salam is from the 
same root as Islam. Islam, in fact, makes even this world an abode of peace for a 
true Muslim; he makes his peace with his Lord, and he lives at peace with his 
fellow beings. The peace of the next life is, in fact, a continuation of the peace of 
mind which a Muslim finds in this very life. 

b (26) Throughout the Quran the reward of virtue is spoken of as being much 
more than actual recompense, while evil is either spoken of as being forgiven or 
as being punished only with a like punishment. See 42:25-26 and 6: 160.

30 There will every soul become acquainted with what it did before, 
and they will be brought back to Allah, their true Patron, and what 
they devised will escape from them. 

Section 4: Uniqueness of Divine Gifts 

31 Say: Who gives you sustenance from the heaven and the 
earth, or who controls the hearing and the sight, and who brings 
forth the living from the dead, and brings forth the dead from the 
living? And who regulates the affair? They will say: Allah. Say 
then: Will you not then guard against evil? 32 Such then is Allah, 
your true Lord. And what is there after the truth but error? How 
then are you turned away (from truth)! 33 Thus does the word of 
jour Lord prove true against those who transgress that they do not 
believe." 

34 Say: Is there anyone among your associate-gods who pro- 
duces the first creation, then reproduces it? Say: Allah produces 
the first creation, then He reproduces it. How are you then turned 
away (from truth)! 35 Say: Is there any of your associate-gods who 
guides to the Truth? Say: Allah guides to the Truth. Is He then 
Who guides to the Truth more worthy to be followed, or he who 
cannot find the way unless he is guided? What is the matter with 
you? How do you judge? 36 And most of them follow only conjec- 
ture. Surely conjecture will not avail at all against the Truth. Truly 
Allah is Knower of what they do. 

37 And this Quran is not such as could be forged by those 
besides Allah, but it is a verification of what is before it and a 
clear explanation of the Book, there is no doubt in it, from the Lord 
of the worlds. 38 0r say they: He has forged it? Say: Then bring a 



a (33) The word refers to the fact that their disbelief is a result of their trans-

b (37) The Quran explains in clear words many of the most important prin- 
ciples of religion which are left ambiguous or obscure in the previous books. For 
instance, the Bible is obscure on the important principle of resurrection or life 
after death. Similarly the attributes of the Divine Being are not explained in clear

Even thus did those before them reject; then see what was the end 
of the wrongdoers. 40 And some of them believe in it, and some of 
them do not believe in it. And jour Lord best knows the mischief- 
makers. 

Section 5: The Guilty and their Punishment 

41 And if they reject you, say: My work is for me and your 
work for you. You are clear of what I do and I am clear of what 
you do. 42 And some of them listen to you. But can you make the 
deaf to hear, though they will not understand? 43 And some of them 
look at you. But can you show the way to the blind, though they 
will not see? ' 44 Surely Allah does not wrong people in the least, 
but people wrong themselves. 

45 And on the day when He will gather them, as though they 
had not stayed but an hour of the day, they will recognize one 
another. They perish indeed who reject the meeting with Allah, 
and they do not follow the right way. 46 And if We show you some- 
thing of what We promise them, or cause you to die (before that), 
yet to Us is their return, and Allah is Witness to what they do. e 
47 And for every nation there is a messenger. So when their messen- 
ger comes, the matter is decided between them with justice, and 
they are not wronged. 

words and the result is the doctrine of the divinity of Jesus Christ. The Quran fully 
explains all such points and finally settles all these questions. 

a (39) The final sequel is the consequence of the rejection of the Truth. 

b (43) Compare 7:179: "They have hearts with which they do not understand, 
and they have eyes with which they do not see, and they have ears with which they 
do not hear." 

c (46) The significance of the words "to Us is their return" is that those who 
are warned will be dealt with by Allah as they deserve, and the warning will prove 
true. It is no concern of theirs whether the Prophet lives to punish them with his 
own hands or that punishment is executed by Allah in some other way. 

rf(47) Compare 35:24: "And there is not a people but a warner has gone

48 And they say: When will this promise be fulfilled, if you 
are truthful? 49 Say: I do not control for myself any harm, or any 
benefit, except what Allah pleases." Every nation has a term. When 
their term comes, they cannot postpone it an hour, nor bring it 
forward. 50 Say: Do you see if His punishment comes to you by 
night or by day? c What (part) of it would the guilty hasten? 51 And 
when it comes to pass, will you believe in it? What! now! and you 
hastened it on. 52 Then will it be said to those who were unjust: 
Taste abiding punishment; you are not recompensed except for 
what you earned. 53 And they ask you: Is that true? Say: Yes, by 
my Lord! it is surely the Truth, and you will not escape. 

Section 6: Mercy takes Precedence over Punishment 

54 And if every soul that has done wrong had all that is in the 
earth, it would offer it for ransom. And they will manifest regret 
when they see the punishment. And it will be decided between 
them with justice, and they will not be wronged. 55 Now surely 
whatever is in the heavens and the earth is Allah's. Now surely 
Allah's promise is true, but most of them do not know. 56 He gives 
life and causes death, and to Him you will be returned. 

57 O people, an admonition has indeed come to you from 
your Lord and a healing for what is in the hearts; and a guidance 

among them". Humanity will always be under the deepest obligation to the Holy 
Prophet for this broad humanitarian principle. By "between them" must be under- 
stood the messenger and those who charge him with falsehood. 

a (49-1) These are not the words which a pretender would utter but are those 
of an honest man who, without assuming any personal pretensions, preaches truth 
in all sincerity. The Holy Prophet is repeatedly made to disclaim any control of 
good and evil, so that he offers no low temptation to his followers. Truth must be 
accepted for its own sake, not for any hope of worldly gain or fear of worldly loss. 

b (49-2) The verse does not teach fatalism. It lays down a truth which no 
historian can deny. To every nation, as to every individual, is granted a term of 
life, and nations live and die like individuals. 

c (50) The coming of the doom by night or by day signifies its coming at a 
time when people are engaged in their revelries or occupied with their business 
transactions, so as to be utterly inattentive to the real values of life. 



10:58' GOOD NEWS FOR THE FAITHFUL 263 

and a mercy for the believers." 58 Say: In the grace of Allah and in 
His mercy, in that they should rejoice. It is better than what they 
hoard. 59 Say: Do you see the sustenance that Allah has sent down 
for you, then you make (a part) of it unlawful and (a part) lawful. 
Say: Has Allah commanded you or do you forge a lie against 
Allah? 60 And what do those think who forge lies against Allah of 
the day of Resurrection? Surely Allah is Bountiful to people, but 
most of them do not give thanks. 

Section 7: Good News for the Faithful 

61 And you are not (engaged) in any matter nor you recite 
concerning it any portion of the Quran, and you do no work, but 
We are witness of you when you are engaged in it. And not the 
weight of an atom in the earth or in the heaven is hidden from 
jour Lord, nor anything less than that nor greater, but it is (all) in 
a clear book' 

62 Now surely the friends of Allah, they have no fear nor 
do they grieve — 63 those who believe and keep their duty. 



a (57) They demanded punishment again and again, but they are told that 
Allah has sent to them that in which they will find a healing and a guidance and a 
mercy for them, viz. the Quran. Compare 29:51, where, in answer to a demand for 
a sign which should destroy them, the disbelievers are told: "Is it not enough for 
them that We have revealed to you (O Prophet) the Book which is recited to 
them? Surely there is mercy in this and a reminder for a people who believe". 

b (59) Just as Allah gave them the means of their physical sustenance, He has 
also sent His grace and mercy for their spiritual welfare through revelation. Yet 
they deprive themselves of the spiritual sustenance as if it were unlawful. Or the 
reference may be to their declaring certain things to be unlawful for them out of 
reverence for their idols. 

c (61) The clear book mentioned here is not, of course, a collection of written 
or printed sheets bound together. It is the book of the Divine law which makes 
every deed, good or evil, great or small, bring its recompense. 

d (62) The friends of Allah are those who help the Divine cause and invite 
people to faith in God. They attain to that spiritual height where fear and grief are 
unknown. There is also a prophecy of the ultimate triumph of Truth, for when a 
man attains his object, all his fear is gone and he no more grieves for the sacri- 
fices he has made. 



264 10. JONAH -10:64 

64 For them is good news a in this world's life and in the Hereafter. 
There is no changing the words of Allah. That is the mighty 
achievement. 

65 And do not let their speech grieve yon. Surely might belongs 
wholly to Allah. He is the Hearer, the Knower. 66 Now, surely, 
whatever is in the heavens and whatever is in the earth is Allah's. 
And what do follow those who call on associate-gods besides Allah? 
They follow nothing but conjecture, and they only lie. 67 He it is 
Who made for you the night that you might rest therein and the 
day giving light. Surely there are signs in this for a people who 
hear. 68 They say: Allah has taken a son (to Himself). Glory be to 
Him! He is the Self-sufficient. His is what is in the heavens and 
what is in the earth. You have no authority for this. Do you say 
against Allah what you do not know? 69 Say: Those who forge a lie 
against Allah will not succeed. 70 A little enjoyment in this world, 
then to Us is their return, then We shall make them taste severe 
punishment because they disbelieved. 

Section 8: Noah and Moses 

71 And recite to them the story of Noah, when he said to his 
people: My people, if my staying (here) and my reminding (you) 
by the messages of Allah is hard on you, on Allah do I rely; so 
decide upon your course of action and (gather) your associates. 
Then do not let your course of action be dubious to you, so have it 



a (64-1) The Holy Prophet said: "There has remained nothing of prophet- 
hood except mubashsharaty Asked what is meant by mubashshardt, he replied, 
"Good visions" (Bukhari, 92:5). Elsewhere good visions are said to be a part of 
prophethood (Bukhari 92:4), which shows that, as the prophets were informed of 
the triumph of Truth, so will their followers be given this good news in their 
visions. The upholders of the Divine cause, we are told, will not only be success- 
ful, they will also receive the good news of their ultimate triumph in good visions. 

b (64-2) The words of Allah here signify the prophecies. It is the prophecy of 
the good reward for the faithful that is mentioned immediately before these words, 
and the meaning of there being no change is that the prophetic word must be 
fulfilled; compare similar words used in 6:34, 6:115 and 18:27. 



10 : 72 • NOAH AND MOSES 265 

executed against me and give me no respite. a 72 But if you turn 
back, I ask for no reward from you. My reward is only with Allah, 
and I am commanded to be of those who submit. 

73 But they rejected him, so We delivered him and those with 
him in the ark, and We made them rulers and drowned those who 
rejected Our messages. See, then, what was the end of those who 
were warned. 74 Then after him We sent messengers to their people. 
They came to them with clear arguments, but they would not believe 
what they had rejected before. Thus do We seal the hearts of those 
who exceed the limits. 

75 Then after them We sent Moses and Aaron to Pharaoh and 
his chiefs with Our signs, but they were arrogant, and they were a 
guilty people. 76 So when the truth came to them from Us, they 
said: This is surely clear enchantment! 77 Moses said: Do you say 
(this) of the truth when it has come to you? Is it enchantment? 
And the enchanters never succeed. 78 They said: Have you come to 
us to turn us away from what we found our fathers following, and 
(that) greatness in the land may be for you two? And we are not 
going to believe in you. 

79 And Pharaoh said: Bring to me every skilful enchanter. 
80 So when the enchanters came, Moses said to them: Throw down 
what you are going to throw. 81 So when they had thrown down, 
Moses said: What you have brought is deception. Surely Allah 
will make it null. Surely Allah does not allow the work of mischief- 
makers to thrive. 82 And Allah will establish the truth by His words, 
though the guilty dislike (it). 



a (71) The challenge of Noah to his opponents was, in fact, being reproduced 
now as a challenge to the opponents of the Holy Prophet. And these opponents 
did, in fact, decide upon their course of action in their great council hall, perhaps a 
year or two later, and surrounded the Prophet's house in accordance with that 
decision. But the Prophet escaped unnoticed from among them and they were 
unable to lay their hands on him. 

b (74) They do not ponder over the truth, but, having rejected once, go on 
opposing its progress without reflecting on it. This condition is described as the 
sealing of the heart, because the heart ceases to reflect. 



266 10. JONAH -10:83 

Section 9: End of Opposition to Moses 

83 But, on account of the fear of Pharaoh and their chiefs 
persecuting them, none believed in Moses except a few of his 
people." And Pharaoh was truly high-handed in the land; and 
surely he was one committing excesses. 84 And Moses said: My 
people, if you believe in Allah, then rely on Him if you submit (to 
Him). 85 They said: On Allah we rely; our Lord, do not make us a 
trial for the unjust people. 86 And deliver us by Your mercy from 
the disbelieving people. 

87 And We revealed to Moses and his brother: Take for your 
people houses to abide in Egypt and make your houses places of 
worship* and keep up prayer. And give good news to the belie- 
vers. 88 And Moses said: Our Lord, surely You have given Pharaoh 
and his chiefs finery and riches in this world's life, our Lord, that 
they may lead (people) astray from Your way. c Our Lord, destroy 
their riches and harden their hearts, so that they do not believe till 
they see the painful punishment. 89 He said: Your prayer is accep- 
ted; so continue in the right way and do not follow the path of 
those who do not know. 

90 And We brought the Children of Israel across the sea. Then 
Pharaoh and his armies followed them for oppression and tyranny, 
till, when drowning overtook him, he said: I believe that there is 
no god but He in Whom the Children of Israel believe, and I am of 
those who submit. 6 91 What! Now! And indeed before (this) you 



a (83) The Israelites believed in Moses as the verses that follow show. By 
his people, therefore, are meant Pharaoh's wife (66:11) and a believer (40:28). 

b (87) The qiblah is that facing which one prays, and therefore it indicates a 
place of worship. The Israelites were obliged to pray in their houses because they 
did not enjoy full religious liberty in Egypt and had no public places of worship. 

c (88-1) The significance is not that God had granted them riches to mislead 
people, but that this was the end for which they used their riches. 

d (88-2) Pharaoh and his people did not care for either arguments or signs. 
Moses therefore now prays for their punishment. 

e (90) In the agonies of death, even pronounced atheists have sometimes 
recognized the existence of God.

save you in your body that you may be a sign to those after you. 
And surely most of the people are heedless of Our signs/ 

Section 10: Those who heed Warning will Benefit 

93 And certainly We lodged the Children of Israel in a goodly 
abode and provided them with good things. Then they did not dif- 
fer till the knowledge came to them. Surely your Lord will judge 
between them on the day of Resurrection in that in which they 
differed. 94 But if you are in doubt as to what We have revealed to 
you, ask those who read the Book before you. c Certainly the Truth 
has come to you from your Lord, so do not be one of the doubters, 
95 nor be of those who reject the messages of Allah, (for) then you 
will be from among the losers. 96 Surely those against whom the 
word of your Lord has proved true will not believe, 97 though every 
sign should come to them, till they see the painful punishment. 



a (92) That the body was really cast ashore, though the Bible does not mention 
it, is clear from the fact that the body of Rameses II, who is regarded as the Pharaoh 
of Moses, has been discovered as preserved among the mummies in Egypt. This is 
another instance of the insufficiency of the Bible narrative and of the truth of the 
Quranic statement where it supplements the Bible. The discovery now made could 
not have been known to the Holy Prophet; it was not known to any person in the 
world till very recently. 

b (93) This may be a prophetical announcement as to the Jewish attitude 
towards the Prophet Muhammad later on when he fled to Madinah. 

c (94) The person addressed in the Quran in the singular form is not always 
the Prophet but often the reader, as here. Nor do the words revealed to you (in the 
singular) show that the Prophet is meant, for the Quran is in many places spoken 
of as being revealed to all the people (see 2:136, 21:10). Verse 104 makes it clear 
that the reader is addressed: "Say: O people, if you are in doubt as to my religion". 
Throughout the Quran the Holy Prophet appears as having the greatest certainty 
about the word which was revealed to him, so much so that he never entertained 
the slightest doubt about the truth of the promises of future success and triumph. 
In the very next verse the words are, nor be of those who reject the messages of 
Allah, which shows clearly that it is the Prophet's opponents who are addressed 
here. The words "ask those who read the Book before you" mean: ask them 
whether previous revelation does not contain clear prophecies of the advent of 
such a Prophet.

98 And why was there not a town which believed, so that 
their belief should have benefited them, but the people of Jonah? 
When they believed, We removed from them the punishment of 
disgrace in this world's life, and We gave them provision for a 
while." "And if your Lord had pleased, all those who are in the 
earth would have believed, all of them. Will you then force people 
till they are believers? 100 And it is not for any soul to believe 
except by Allah's permission. And He casts uncleanness on those 
who will not understand^

along with you. 103 Then We deliver Our messengers and those 
who believe — even so (now); it is binding on Us to deliver the 
believers. 

Section 1 1 : Divine Judgment 

104 Say: O people, if you are in doubt as to my religion, (know 
that) I do not serve those whom you serve besides Allah, but I 
serve Allah, Who causes you to die; and I am commanded to be 
one of the believers, 105 and that you set yourself for the religion, 



a (98) Jonah bears a resemblance to the Holy Prophet in that his people 
benefited by the warning, as did the Arabs by the warning of the Prophet, though 
after much opposition. Jonah is thus the type of a prophet whose people were 
dealt with mercifully. 

b (99) Compare 2:256: "There is no compulsion in religion". The reference 
is to the great zeal of the Holy Prophet and his over-exerting himself in preaching 
the Truth: "Then perhaps you will kill yourself with grief, sorrowing after them, if 
they do not believe in this announcement" (18:6). {Editor's Note: The Quran tells 
us here that it is in the natural order of things that while some people believe, 
others do not, and no human being can or should apply compulsion to others in 
this regard.) 

c (100) Those who refuse to understand the truth will find uncleanness cast 
on them. The word rijs ("uncleanness") also means punishment, and the meaning, 
in that case, is that those who care not for the warning must receive the punish- 
ment.

Allah). i° 6 Nor call besides Allah on that which can neither benefit 
you nor harm you; for if you do, you shall then be of the unjust. 
107 And if Allah afflicts you with harm, there is none to remove it 
but He; and if He intends good to you, there is none to repel His 
grace. He brings it to whom He pleases of His servants. And He is 
the Forgiving, the Merciful. 

108 Say: O people, the Truth has indeed come to you from 
your Lord; so whoever goes aright, goes aright only for the good 
of his own soul; and whoever goes astray, goes astray only to its 
detriment. And I am not a custodian over you. 109 And follow what 
is revealed to you and be patient till Allah give judgment, and He 
is the Best of the judges. 



Chapter 1 1 
Hud 

The history of the Prophet Hud is referred to in this chapter. While the last 
chapter dealt mostly with abstract questions relating to the truth of revelation, 
this chapter illustrates the truth of those questions by referring to the histories 
of former prophets. Thus it deals with the histories of Noah, Hud, Salih, 
Abraham, Lot and Shuaib. A cruel and persecuting enemy is warned of the 
fate that befell previous people. This chapter was revealed during the last 
four years of the period of the Holy Prophet's life at Makkah. 



Section 1 : A Warning 

In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful. 

1 I, Allah, am the Seer. A Book, whose verses are charac- 
terized by wisdom, then they are made plain, from One Wise, 
Aware: 2 that you should serve none but Allah. Surely I am to you 
from Him a warner and a giver of good news. 3 And ask for- 
giveness of your Lord, then turn to Him. He will provide you with 
a goodly provision to an appointed term, and will bestow His 
grace on every one endowed with grace. a And if you turn away, I 
fear for you the punishment of a great day. 4 To Allah is your 
return, and He is Powerful over all things. 5 Now surely they cover 
up their breasts to conceal (their enmity) from Him. Now surely, 
when they put their garments as a covering, He knows what they 
hide and what they make public. Surely He is Knower of what is 
in the breasts. 

J? 6 And there is no animal in the earth but on Allah is the sus- 

«■ tenance of it, and He knows its abode and its repository. All is in a 



a (3) One endowed with grace here is the possessor of spiritual blessings in 
addition to the material benefits spoken of in the preceding words.

back from lending an ear, or it is an allusion to their running away.

clear record. 7 And He it is Who created the heavens and the earth 
in six periods; and His Throne of Power is ever on water " that He 
might manifest (the good qualities in) you, whoever of you is best 
in deeds. And if you say, You shall surely be raised up after 
death, those who disbelieve say: This is nothing but clear deceit. 
8 And if We delay for them the punishment for a stated period, 
they will certainly say: What prevents it? Now surely on the day 
when it will come to them, it will not be averted from them, and 
what they mocked at will beset them. 

Section 2: Truth of Revelation 

9 And if We make man taste mercy from Us, then withdraw it 
from him, he is surely despairing, ungrateful. 10 And if We make 
him taste a favour after distress has afflicted him, he says: The 
evils are gone away from me. Certainly he is exultant, boastful, 
1 'except those who are patient and do good. For them is forgive- 
ness and a great reward. 

12 Then, may it be that you will give up part of what is 
revealed to you and your heart will be distressed by it, because 
they say: Why has not a treasure been sent down for him or an 
angel come with him? c Fou are only a warner. And Allah is in 



a (7-1) For the meaning of 'arsh or Throne of Power see 7:54 footnote 2. 
The great power of God which is manifested in the creation of man is connected 
with water because physical life grows out of water. Similarly, spiritual life grows 
out of revelation, which is so often compared with rain or water. God's great power 
has thus been made manifest through water, and hence with the creation of the 
heavens and the earth is mentioned the fact that God's Throne of Power is ever on 
the waters. The words that follow make it clearer still. 

b (7-2) The object of the creation of man and all that has been brought into 
existence is that the great qualities with which man is endowed should be mani- 
fested. But that manifestation, we are told in the words that follow, takes place not 
in this life but in the life after death. 

c (12) This passage does not signify that the Prophet intended to give up any 
part of the revelation; on the other hand, it is a strong statement indicating that he 
could not do it. It is a peculiar use of the word la 'alia ("maybe"). When it is in- 
tended to show a person's remoteness from a thing, it is said: Maybe he has power 
to do such a thing. 



272 11. HUD -11:13 

charge of all things. 13 Or, say they: He has forged it. Say: Then 
bring ten forged chapters like it, and call upon whom you can 
besides Allah, if you are truthful." 14 But if they do not answer you, 
then know that it is revealed by Allah's knowledge, and that there 
is no God but He. Will you then submit?* 

15 Whoever desires this world's life and its finery — We repay 
them their deeds in it, and they are not made to suffer loss in it. 
16 These are they for whom there is nothing but Fire in the Here- 
after. And what they work in it is fruitless and their deeds are 
futile. e 17 Is he then (like these) who has with him clear proof from 
his Lord, and a witness from Him recites it, and before it (is) the 
Book of Moses, a guide and a mercy? These believe in it. And 
whoever of the parties disbelieves in it, the Fire is his promised 
place. So do not be in doubt about it. Surely it is the truth from 
jour Lord, but most people do not believe. 



a (13) See also 2:23 and footnote. This challenge is contained in four different 
chapters of the Quran. The earliest in point of revelation is 17:88: "Say: If people 
and jinn should combine together to bring the like of this Quran, they could not 
bring the like of it, though some of them were aiders of others." Then in the verse 
above, the demand is reduced to ten chapters. Lastly in 10:38 and 2:23 they are 
challenged to produce a single chapter like the Quran. Another point worth noting 
is that, while in 17:88 people and jinn are challenged, in 2:23 the word shuhada', 
which means helpers, leaders or their great or learned men, is substituted for jinn, 
thus showing that jinn in 17:88 are only human beings. 

b (14) If the false gods or the leaders do not answer their devotees when they 
call on them to assist them in producing a like of the Quran, then at least no doubt 
should be left in their minds that the Quran is not the work of the Prophet, but a 
revelation from the Divine Being. 

c (16) That is, their deeds will not result in any good to them. 

d(\l) He who has with him clear proof from his Lord applies to every 
believer in the truth of the Quran; the words these believe in it, occurring further 
on, make this clear. The witness from Allah, who recites it, is the Holy Prophet, 
who is called a witness elsewhere, as being an exemplar for the believers. Besides 
being a clear proof in itself, the Quran has a further evidence of its truth in the 
book of Moses, which is, therefore, called a guide and a mercy, because it con- 
tains clear prophecies of the truth of the Prophet. The meaning of the whole 
passage is: He who, being a believer in the truth of the Quran, has clear proof 
from his Lord, and who has an exemplar for him in the person of the Holy 
Prophet, and has additional testimony of his truth in the book of Moses, is not like 



11:18* HISTORY OF NOAH 273 

18 And who is more unjust than he who forges a lie against 
Allah? These will be brought before their Lord, and the witnesses 
will say:" These are they who lied against their Lord. Now surely 
the curse of Allah is on the wrongdoers, 19 who hinder (people) 
from the path of Allah and desire to make it crooked. And they are 
disbelievers in the Hereafter. 20 These will not escape in the earth, 
nor do they have guardians besides Allah. The punishment will be 
doubled for them. They could not bear to hear, c and they did not 
see. 21 These are they who have lost their souls, and what they 
forged is gone from them. 22 Truly in the Hereafter they are the 
greatest losers. 

23 Surely those who believe and do good and humble them- 
selves before their Lord, these are the owners of the Garden; in it 
they will abide. 24 The likeness of the two parties is as the blind 
and the deaf, and the seer and the hearer. Are they equal in con- 
dition? Will you not then be mindful? 

Section 3: History of Noah 

25 And certainly We sent Noah to his people (saying): Surely 
I am a plain warner to you, 26 to serve none but Allah. Indeed I fear 
for you the punishment of a painful day. 27 But the chiefs of his 
people who disbelieved said: We do not see you but (as) a mortal 
like us, nor do we see that any follow you but those who are the 
lowest of us at first thought. Nor do we see in you any superiority 
over us; no, we think you to be liars. 

28 He said: My people, do you see if I have with me clear 
proof from my Lord, and He has granted me mercy from Himself 



him who loves this world and cares not for the Truth. The latter statement, being 
included in the previous verses, is omitted here. 

a (18) The witnesses are according to some the angels; according to others, 
the prophets — and this is corroborated by 4:41; according to still others the

b (20-1) They would not escape the punishment, if Allah intended to punish 
them in this world. 

c (20-2) They could not bear even to hear what the Prophet said.

and it has been made obscure to you? Can we compel you to 
(accept) it while you dislike it? 29 And, my people, I do not ask you 
for wealth (in return) for it. My reward is only with Allah, and I 
am not going to drive away those who believe. Surely they will 
meet their Lord, but I see you a people who are ignorant. 30 And, 
my people, who will help me against Allah, if I drive them away? 
Will you not then be mindful? 31 And I do not say to you that I 
have the treasures of Allah, nor do I know the unseen, nor do I say 
that I am an angel. Nor do I say about those whom your eyes 
scorn that Allah will not grant them (any) good — Allah knows 
best what is in their souls — for then indeed I should be of the 
wrongdoers. 

32 They said: Noah, indeed you have disputed with us and 
prolonged dispute with us, so bring upon us what you threaten us 
with, if you are truthful. 33 He said: Only Allah will bring it on you, 
if He please, and you will not escape; 34 and my advice will not 
benefit you, if I intend to give you good advice, if Allah intends to 
destroy you. He is your Lord; and to Him you will be brought 
back. 

35 Or do they say: He has forged it? Say: If I have forged it, 
on me is my guilt; and I am free of what you are guilty of° 

Section 4: History of Noah 

36 And it was revealed to Noah: None of jour people will 
believe except those who have already believed, so do not grieve 
at what they do; 37 and make the ark under Our eyes and Our reve- 
lation, and do not speak to Me on behalf of those who are unjust. 
Surely they will be drowned. 

38 And he began to make the ark. And whenever the chiefs of 
his people passed by him, they laughed at him. He said: If you 



a (35) The change shows positively that the disbelievers of Makkah are 
meant, and the reference is to their calling the Quran a forgery. This shows that 
the histories of the prophets are referred to in the Quran as a warning for the Holy 
Prophet's opponents. 



11 : 39 • HISTORY OF NOAH 275 

laugh at us, surely we, too, laugh at you as you laugh (at us). a 
39 So you shall know who it is on whom will come a punishment 
which will disgrace him, and on whom a lasting punishment will 
fall. 

40 At length when Our command came and water gushed forth 
from the valley,* We said: Carry in it two of all things, a pair, c and 
jour own family — except those against whom the word has 
already gone forth — and those who believe. And only a few 
believed with him. 41 And he said: Embark in it, in the name of 
Allah be its sailing and its anchoring. Surely my Lord is Forgiv- 
ing, Merciful. 42 And it moved on with them amid waves like 
mountains. And Noah called out to his son, who was apart: My 
son, embark with us and do not be with the disbelievers. 43 He said: 
I will take refuge on a mountain that will save me from the water. 



a (38) The laughing of the righteous at the wicked is not to be taken literally. 
You laugh at a thing to show your contempt for it; just as the disbelieving people 
showed their contempt for the making of the ark, the believer in Divine promise 
shows his contempt for their opposition and their plans to destroy him. 

b (40-1) Far al-tanniir has often been translated as the oven poured forth 
water or the oven boiled or the earth 's surface boiled up. But the meaning of fara 
which suits the context here, is not of boiling, but of water spouting forth, and that 
of tannur applicable here is not oven but a place where the water of a valley 
collects. 

c (40-2) By all things are meant all things needed by Noah, and not all things 
existing in the world, which was too extensive for Noah to travel over. 

d (42) The Quran does not support the story that the deluge covered the whole 
surface of the earth. On the other hand, it repeatedly speaks of Noah as having 
been sent to his people, i.e. to a single tribe, and according to the Divine law the 
punishment must have overtaken his people, who not only rejected the truth, but 
also sought to destroy Noah and his followers. The mention of the water flowing 
from the valley also shows that it was only a tract of land that was deluged, and 
not the entire earth. The taking in of a pair of all things does not mean that Noah 
had travelled over the whole earth and taken a pair of every living animal wherever 
it could be found. The order is clearly to take in pairs of all those things that he 
considered necessary for himself and those who were with him in the ark. The 
Bible narrative, which speaks of God "bringing floodwaters on the earth, to des- 
troy from under heaven all flesh in which is the breath of life," (Genesis, 6:17), 
and then makes Noah collect and lodge in an ark a pair of each of the thousands 
of animals and birds, cannot be accepted. 



276 11. HUD -11:44 

He said: There is none safe today from Allah's command, but he 
on whom He has mercy. And a wave intervened between them, so 
he was among the drowned. 

44 And it was said: O earth, swallow your water, and O cloud, 
clear away. And the water was made to subside, and the affair was 
decided, and it rested on the JudI," and it was said: Away with the 
wrongdoing people! 45 And Noah cried to his Lord and said: My 
Lord, surely my son is of my family, and Your promise is true, 
and You are the most just of the judges. 46 He said: O Noah, he is 
not of your family; he is (an embodiment of) unrighteous conduct. 
So do not ask of Me that of which you have no knowledge. I admo- 
nish you so you may not be of the ignorant ones. 47 He said: My 
Lord, I seek refuge in You from asking of You that of which 1 
have no knowledge. And unless You forgive me and have mercy 
on me, I shall be among the losers. 48 It was said: O Noah, descend 
with peace from Us and blessing on you and on nations (spring- 
ing) from those with you. And there are nations whom We afford 
provisions, then a painful punishment from Us afflicts them. 

49 These are announcements relating to the unseen which We 
reveal to you; you did not know them — (neither) you nor your 
people — before this. So be patient. Surely the (good) end is for 
the dutiful. c 



a (44) The Greek name of this mountain is said to be Gordyoei, being one of 
those mountains which divide Armenia on the south from Mesopotamia (Iraq). 

b (46) When it is meant to speak of a person as the very embodiment of a 
certain quality, he is designated not as the possessor of that quality, but as that 
quality itself. In 2:177 it is said, literally, righteousness is the one who believes, 
the meaning being that such a person is the embodiment of righteousness. 

c (49) The announcement relating to the unseen is the fate of the opponents 
of the Holy Prophet as read in Noah's history. The words that follow — be patient 
— are a clear indication, for patient waiting was needed for the fate of the 
Prophet's opponents, not for anything relating to Noah's history. 



1 1 : 50 • HISTORY OF HUD 277 

Section 5: History of Hud 

50 And to Ad (We sent) their brother Hfid. fl He said: My 
people, serve Allah, you have no god other than Him. You are 
only fabricators. 51 My people, I ask of you no reward for it. My 
reward is only with Him Who created me. Do you not then under- 
stand? 52 And, my people, ask forgiveness of your Lord, then turn 
to Him, He will send on you clouds pouring down abundance of 
rain and add strength to your strength, and do not turn back, 
guilty. 

53 They said: Hud, you have brought us no clear argument, 
and we are not going to desert our gods for jour word, and we are 
not believers in you. 54 We say nothing but that some of our gods 
have struck you with evil. He said: Surely I call Allah to witness, 
and you should bear witness too, that I am innocent of what you 
set up (with Allah) 55 besides Him. So scheme against me all 
together, then give me no respite. 56 Surely I put my trust in Allah, 
my Lord and your Lord. There is no living creature but He grasps 
it by its forelock. Surely my Lord is on the right path. 57 But if 
you turn away, then indeed I have delivered to you the message 
with which I am sent to you. And my Lord will bring another 
people in your place, and you cannot do Him any harm. Surely my 
Lord is the Preserver of all things. 

58 And when Our commandment came to pass, We delivered 
Hud and those who believed with him with mercy from Us; and 
We delivered them from a hard punishment. 59 And such were Ad. 
They denied the messages of their Lord, and disobeyed His messen- 
gers and followed the bidding of every insolent opposer (of truth). 
60 And they were overtaken by a curse in this world and on the day 
of Resurrection. Now surely Ad disbelieved in their Lord. Now 
surely, away with Ad, the people of Hud! 



a (50) See 7:65 footnote. 

b (56) My Lord is on the right path signifies that He does not deviate from 
justice. 



278 11. HUD - 11 : 61 

Section 6: History of Salih 

61 And to Thamud (We sent) their brother Salih. a He said: 
My people, serve Allah, you have no god other than Him. He 
brought you forth from the earth and made you dwell in it, so ask 
forgiveness of Him, then turn to Him. Surely my Lord is near, 
answering. 62 They said: Salih, you were among us a centre of 
(our) hopes before this. Do you forbid us to worship what our 
fathers worshipped? And surely we are in grave doubt about that 
to which you call us. 63 He said: My people, do you see if I have 
clear proof from my Lord and He has granted me mercy from 
Himself — who will then help me against Allah, if I disobey 
Him? So you would add to me nothing but perdition. 64 And, my 
people, this is Allah's she-camel, a sign for you, so leave her to 
pasture on Allah's earth and do her no harm, or a punishment will 
soon come upon you. 65 But they hamstrung her, so he said: Enjoy 
yourselves in your houses for three days. That is a promise not to 
be belied. 

66 So when Our commandment came to pass, We saved Salih 
and those who believed with him by mercy from Us from the dis- 
grace of that day. Surely jour Lord — He is the Strong, the Mighty. 
67 And the cry overtook those who did wrong, e so they were motion- 
less bodies in their abodes, 68 as though they had never dwelt in 
them. Now surely Thamud disbelieved in their Lord. So away 
with Thamud! 

Section 7: Abraham and Lot 

69 And certainly Our messengers came to Abraham with good 
news. They said: 'Peace!' 'Peace!', said he. And he made no delay 



a (61) See 7:73 footnote 1. 

b (64) See 7:73 footnote 2. 

c (67) It was an earthquake. See 7:78. 

d (69) Whether they were angels or men, is not made clear here or anywhere 
else in the Quran. But as they did not partake of food, and the fact that they 
brought to Abraham news of a son and of the destruction of Lot's people, they are 
generally looked upon as angels who appeared in the similitude of men. 



1 1 : 70 • ABRAHAM AND LOT 279 

in bringing a roasted calf. 70 But when he saw that their hands did 
not reach to it, he mistrusted them and conceived fear of them. 
They said: Do not fear; we have been sent to Lot's people. 

71 And his wife was standing (by), so she wondered." Then 
We gave her the good news of Isaac, and beyond Isaac, of Jacob.* 
72 She said: O wonder! e Shall I bear a son when I am an extremely 
old woman, and this my husband an extremely old man? This is a 
wonderful thing indeed! 73 They said: Do you wonder at Allah's 
commandment? The mercy of Allah and His blessings be on you, 
people of the house! Surely He is Praised, Glorious. 

74 So when fear departed from Abraham and good news came 
to him, he began to plead with Us for Lot's people. 75 Surely 
Abraham was forbearing, tender-hearted, oft-returning (to Allah). 
76 Abraham, cease from this. Surely the decree of jour Lord has 
gone forth and a punishment must come to them which cannot be 
averted. 

77 And when Our messengers came to Lot, he was grieved for 
them, and he was unable to protect them, and said: This is a 
distressful day! 

78 And his people came to him, (as if) driven on towards him, 
and they were used to the doing of evil deeds before. He said: My 



a (71-1) It is made clear in 5 1 :24-34 that the news of the birth of a son was 
given to Abraham first. This explains Sarah's wonder. It was after receiving the 
good news of the birth of a son that Abraham was informed of the destruction of 
Lot's people. The statement made further on that Sarah was given the good news 
of the birth of a son is by way of reassurance on her expression of wonder, and to 
give the further news of a son's son, Jacob. 

6(71-2) Compare Genesis 18:10-12. The mention of a son's son (Jacob) 
was to show that that son should have progeny. The word ward ' ("beyond") also 
means a son's son. Elsewhere Jacob is expressly called nafilah (21:72) which 
means a grandson. 

c (72) The original words yd wailatd, while used to express grief and sorrow, 
are also used to express wonder. 

d (73) AM al-bait ("people of the house") includes the wife of a person; in 
fact, it is Abraham's wife who is primarily addressed here. The same phrase in the 
case of the Holy Prophet (33:33) includes his wives as well as his children. 



280 11. HUD '11:79 

people, these are my daughters — they are purer for you; so guard 
against (the punishment of) Allah and do not disgrace me about 
my guests. Is there not among you any right-minded man? " 
79 They said: Certainly you know that we have no claim on jour 
daughters, and you know what we desire. 80 He said: If only I had 
the power to repel you! — rather I shall have recourse to a strong 
support. 

81 They said: Lot, we are the messengers of jour Lord. They 
shall not reach you. So travel with your people for a part of the 
night — and let none of you turn back — except your wife. Surely 
whatsoever befalls them shall befall her. Surely their appointed 
time is the morning. Is not the morning near? 82 So when Our decree 
came to pass, We turned them upside down, and rained on them 
stones, as decreed, one after another, c 83 marked (for punishment) 
with your Lord. And it is not far off from the wrongdoers. 



a (78) Lot, it appears from Genesis 19:9, was a stranger in the city, and the 
messengers being strangers, the townsmen would not allow him to keep them. Lot 
offered his daughters as hostages so that he might be allowed to keep his guests 
with him, for according to 15:70 he had not permission to allow any stranger to 
come under his roof. Another view is that Lot offered his daughters for marriage, 
as thus he would not be a stranger among them but would be one of them. Some 
commentators have suggested that Lot did not point to his real daughters, but to 
women of the tribe, because a prophet would speak of the women of his tribe as 
his daughters, and in that case he did no more than point to the natural relation of 
man and woman. The answer of his people seems, however, to relate to his 
daughters. 

b (80) Allah is the strong support to Whom the righteous have recourse 
when they are in trouble. The particle au signifies or, as well as rather. 

c (82) It was a severe earthquake, which so utterly demolished the cities as to 
turn them upside down. In 15:73 it is called a rumbling that precedes an earth- 
quake; see 7:84. The raining down of stones might have been the result of a volca- 
nic eruption which was accompanied by an earthquake. 

rf(83) The concluding words indicate a reversion to the subject of the 
punishment of the opponents of the Holy Prophet. It refers to the punishment. 



1 1 : 84 • HISTORY OF SHUAIB 281 

Section 8: History of Shuaib 

84 And to Midian (We sent) their brother Shuaib. He said: My 
people, serve Allah, you have no god other than Him. And do not 
give short measure and weight. I see you in prosperity, and I fear 
for you the punishment of an all-encompassing day. 85 And, my 
people, give full measure and weight justly, and do not defraud 
people of their things, nor act corruptly in the land, making 
mischief. 86 What remains with Allah is better for you, if you are 
believers." And I am not a keeper over you. 

87 They said: Shuaib, does jour prayer enjoin you that we 
should give up what our fathers worshipped or that we should not 
do what we please with regard to our property? So you are the one 
who is the forbearing, the right-directing! 

88 He said: My people, do you see if I have a clear proof from 
my Lord and He has given me a goodly sustenance from Himself? 
And I do not desire to act in opposition to you, in what I forbid 
you. I desire nothing but reform, so far as I am able. And with 
none but Allah is the direction of my affair to a right issue. In Him 
I trust and to Him I turn. 89 And, my people, do not let opposition 
to me make you guilty so that there may befall you the like of 
what befell the people of Noah, or the people of Hud, or the 
people of Salih. Nor are the people of Lot far off from you. 90 And 
ask forgiveness of your Lord, then turn to Him. Surely my Lord is 
Merciful, Loving-kind. 

91 They said: Shuaib, we do not understand much of what you 
say and surely we see you to be weak among us. And if it were not 
for your family, we would surely stone you, and you are not strong 
against us. 92 He said: My people, is my family more esteemed by 
you than Allah? And you neglect Him as a thing cast behind your 
backs! Surely my Lord encompasses what you do. 93 And, my 



a (86) Baqiyyat Allah would properly signify that part of man 's doing which 
remains with Allah, i.e., the righteous or good works, of which the recompense 
remains, the word conveying the same significance as bdqiydt in 18:46 and 19:76. 
But it may also mean what Allah leaves to you after you have paid the dues of 
others. 



282 11. HUD -11:94 

people, act according to your ability, I too am acting. You will 
soon know upon whom will come the punishment, that will dis- 
grace him, and who is a liar. And watch, surely I too am watching 
with you. 

94 And when Our decree came to pass, We delivered Shuaib 
and those who believed with him by mercy from Us. And the cry 
overtook those who did wrong, so they were motionless bodies in 
their abodes, 95 as though they had never dwelt in them. So away 
with Midian, just as Thamud perished! 

Section 9: The Wrongdoers and the Righteous 

96 And certainly We sent Moses with Our signs and a clear 
authority, 97 to Pharaoh and his chiefs, but they followed the bid- 
ding of Pharaoh; and Pharaoh's bidding was not right-directing. 
98 He will lead his people on the day of Resurrection, and bring them 
down to the Fire. And evil the place to which they are brought! 
"And they are followed by a curse in this (world), and on the day 
of Resurrection. Evil the gift which shall be given! 

100 This is an account of the towns which We relate to you. 
Of them are some that stand and (others) mown down. 101 And We 
did not wrong them but they wronged themselves. And their gods 
whom they called upon besides Allah did not avail them in the 
least when the decree of your Lord came to pass. And they added 
to them nothing but ruin. 102 And such is the punishment of your 
Lord, when He punishes the towns while they are wrongdoers. 
Surely His punishment is painful, severe. 103 Surely there is a sign 
in this for him who fears the punishment of the Hereafter. That is 
a day on which people will be gathered together, and that is a day 
to be witnessed. 104 And We do not delay it but for an appointed 
term. 

105 On the day when it comes, no soul will speak except by 
His permission; so (some) of them will be unhappy and (others) 
happy. 106 Then as for those who are unhappy, they will be in the 
Fire; for them there will be in it sighing and groaning —

107 abiding in it so long as the heavens and the earth endure, except 
as your Lord please. Surely your Lord is Doer of what He intends/ 
108 And as for those who are made happy, they will be in the 
Garden abiding in it so long as the heavens and the earth endure, 
except as your Lord please — a gift never to be cut off.* 

109 So do not be in doubt as to what these (people) worship. 
They worship only as their fathers worshipped before. And surely 
We shall pay them in full their due undiminished. 

Section 10: Believers are comforted 

110 And indeed We gave Moses the Book, but differences 
arose concerning it. And if a word had not already gone forth from 
your Lord, judgment would have been given between them. And 
they are surely in a disquieting doubt about it. m And your Lord 
will surely pay back to all their deeds in full. He indeed is Aware 
of what they do. 

112 Continue, then, in the right way as you are commanded, 
as also (should) those who turn (to Allah) with you. And do not be 



a (107) This limitation on the duration of abiding in hell — except as your 
Lord please — is given here and in 6:128, showing clearly that the punishment of 
hell is not everlasting. The next verse states that those in paradise will abide there 
as long as the heavens and the earth endure, "except as your Lord please", but this 
statement is immediately followed by another: A gift never to be cut off. This 
shows that in fact there is no limitation upon the eternity of paradise, and the 
words except as your Lord please have been used, in the case of paradise, only to 
express the unbounded power of the Divine Being and the fact that it is due to 
God's pleasure that they are there. In the case of hell, however, the words except 
as your Lord please are followed by a statement which corroborates the limitation 
thus placed, for, Fa"al or Doer, as an attribute of God, indicates that He does 
even those things which seem impossible to others. 

Three times in the Quran (4:169, 33:65, 72:23) abiding in hell for abad is 
mentioned, which is generally considered as meaning forever. However, abad 
signifies a long time as well as time without end. The Quran makes clear in 78:23 
that a long time is meant as it states there that the disbelievers will remain in hell 
for ahqdb, i.e. long years. 

b (108) In accordance with what is said here, that heavenly life is a gift never 
to be cut off, we have in 15:48: "Nor will they be ejected from there".

inordinate (O people). Surely He is Seer of what you do. 113 And 
do not incline to those who do wrong, so that the fire touch you; 
and you have no protectors besides Allah, then you would not be 
helped. 114 And keep up prayer at the two ends of the day and in 
the first hours of the night.* Surely good deeds take away evil 
deeds. This is a reminder for the mindful. 115 And be patient, for 
surely Allah does not waste the reward of the doers of good. 

116 Why were there not, then, among the generations before 
you, those possessing understanding who forbade mischief in the 
earth except a few among them whom We delivered? And the 
unjust pursued the enjoyment of plenty, and they were guilty. 
n7 And jour Lord would not destroy towns unjustly, while their 
people acted well. c 118 And if your Lord pleased, He would have 
made people a single nation/ And they do not cease to differ, 
119 except those on whom your Lord has mercy; and for this did He 
create them. And the word of your Lord is fulfilled: I will cer- 
tainly fill hell with jinn and people, all together. e 



a (113) Not only is man forbidden to do any wrong himself, but he should 
keep himself at a safe distance from wrong and refrain from leaning towards the 
wrongdoers. 

b (114) The times of prayer are clearly indicated here. Of the two ends of the 
day, the first is the fajr, or the prayer before sunrise, and the second includes the 
zuhr, or the early afternoon, and the 'asr, or the later afternoon, prayers. In the 
first hours of the night we have the maghrib, or the after sunset prayer, and the 
'isha ', or the prayer before going to bed. The two afternoon prayers and the two 
after sunset prayers, which are spoken of together, may under exceptional circum- 
stances be said together in each case. 

c (117) God does not destroy people unjustly. He destroys them only when 
they act corruptly and make mischief in the world. He would not destroy them if 
they act well, whatever their beliefs. Most of the commentators take the word 
zulm (injustice in the word "unjustly") here as meaning shirk or setting up 
partners with God, and the meaning becomes that God would not destroy people, 
even though they were guilty of shirk, provided they acted well. The translation in 
this case would be: your Lord would not destroy towns for wrong beliefs, while 
their people acted well. 

rf(118) God does not force people to one particular belief. He has given 
them the choice to accept or reject the truth. 

e (119) Here it is clearly stated that Allah created all human beings to have

gers is to strengthen jour heart with it. And in this has come to

121 And say to those who do not believe: Act according to your 
power, surely we too are acting; 122 and wait, surely we too are 
waiting. 123 And Allah's is the unseen in the heavens and the earth, 
and to Him the whole affair will be returned. So serve Him and 
put jour trust in Him. And jour Lord is not heedless of what you 
do. 



mercy on them. By His mercy He guides some to the right path, while to others, 
who go over to evil and make themselves deserving of hell, mercy will come only 
after suffering. It is by their own hands that they get into distress and difficulty, 
while Allah has mercy on them in extricating them from it. 

The filling of hell with jinn and people would be because they went against 
the ways which Allah had mercifully shown to them. Therefore they must pass 
through another ordeal, so that they may be purged of evil and made fit for 
spiritual progress. 



Chapter 12 
Yusuf Joseph 

This entire chapter gives a continuous account of the history of Joseph. At the 
beginning and the end it indicates that the purpose is to foretell the ultimate 
triumph of the Holy Prophet Muhammad and the final submission of those 
who were plotting against his life. It is also prophesied here that the mutual 
dealings of the Holy Prophet and his enemies would be similar to the deal- 
ings of Joseph and his brothers: they would persecute him but he would 
forgive them when they would ultimately come before him in submission. 
This chapter was revealed during the last four years of the period of the Holy 
Prophet's life at Makkah. 



Section 1 : Truth of Revelation 

In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful. 

1 I, Allah, am the Seer. These are the verses of the Book that 
makes manifest. 2 Surely We have revealed it — an Arabic Quran 
— that you may understand. 3 We narrate to you the best of 
narratives, in that We have revealed to you this Quran, though 
before this you were of those who are unaware. 

4 When Joseph said to his father: My father, I saw eleven 
stars and the sun and the moon — I saw them making submission 
to me. 5 He said: My son, do not relate your dream to your 



a (3-1) It is called the best narrative because it is the best picture of the 
dealing of the Quraish with the Holy Prophet, and the Prophet's dealing with 
them. It was in the very words of Joseph to his brothers — there is no reproach 
against you this day (v. 92) — that the Holy Prophet forgave the people of 
Makkah all the atrocities they had committed against him. 

b (3-2) The Holy Prophet's "unawareness" relates to his own future, of 
which this chapter gives a clear indication in the incidents of Joseph's life, viz. 
that he was to be expelled from his home but that his countrymen would ulti- 
mately come to him in submission, asking pardon for their faults. But "unaware- 
ness" here may also refer to all those things that are related in the Quran, because 
the Prophet knew nothing of them before revelation.

brothers, in case they devise a plan against you. The devil indeed 
is an open enemy to man. 6 And thus will jour Lord choose you 
and teach you the interpretation of sayings, and make His favour 
complete to you and to the Children of Jacob, as He made it 
complete before to your fathers, Abraham and Isaac. Surely your 
Lord is Knowing, Wise. 

Section 2: Plot against Joseph by his Brothers 

7 Surely in Joseph and his brothers there are signs for the 
inquirers. a 8 When they said: Certainly Joseph and his brother are 
dearer to our father than we, though we are a (strong) company. 
Surely our father is in clear error — 'Kill Joseph or banish him to 
some (other) land, so that your father's regard may be exclusively 
for you, and after that you may be a righteous peopled 10 A speaker 
among them said: Do not kill Joseph, but, if you are going to do 
anything, cast him down to the bottom of the well. Some of the 
travellers may pick him up. 

11 They said: Our father, why do you not trust us with Joseph, 
and surely we are his sincere well-wishers? 12 Send him with us 
tomorrow that he may enjoy himself and play, and we shall surely 
guard him well. 13 He said: Indeed it grieves me that you should 
take him away and I fear that the wolf may eat him while you are 
careless of him. 14 They said: If the wolf should eat him while we 
are so many, we should then certainly be losers. 

15 So when they took him away and agreed to put him down 
at the bottom of the pit, We revealed to him: 7ou will certainly 



a (7) By inquirers are meant people who inquired about the Holy Prophet, 
who was at this time being persecuted most severely by the people of Makkah. 
They are told in plain words that the story of the Prophet and his opponents was 
the story of Joseph and his brothers. 

b (8) Benjamin, his brother by the same mother, is meant here. 

c (9) The conspiracy of the Quraish against the Holy Prophet is referred to in 
the Quran in the words: 'And when those who disbelieved devised plans against 
you that they might confine you or kill you or drive you away" (8:30).

inform them of this affair of theirs while they do not realize/ 
16 And they came to their father at nightfall, weeping. 17 They said: 
Our father, we went off racing with one another and left Joseph by 
our goods, so the wolf ate him. And you will not believe us, 
though we are truthful. 18 And they came with false blood on his 
shirt. He said: Indeed, your souls have made it a light matter for 
you. So patience is best. And Allah is He Whose help is sought 
against what you describe. 

19 And travellers came, and they sent their water-drawer and 
he let down his bucket. He said: Good news! This is a youth. And 
they concealed him as an article of merchandise, and Allah knew 
what they did. 20 And they sold him for a small price, a few pieces 
of silver, and they showed no desire for him. 

Section 3: Joseph's Firmness under Temptation 

21 And the Egyptian who bought him said to his wife: Make 
his stay honourable. Maybe he will be useful to us, or we may 
adopt him as a son. And thus We established Joseph in the land, 
and that We might teach him the interpretation of sayings. And 
Allah has full control over His affair, but most people do not know. 
22 And when he attained his maturity, We gave him wisdom and 
knowledge. And thus do We reward the doers of good. 

23 And she in whose house he was, sought to seduce him, and 
bolted the doors and said: Come. He said: Allah forbid! Surely my 
Lord made good my abode. The wrongdoers never prosper. 24 And 
certainly she desired him, and he would have desired her if he had 
not seen the clear evidence of his Lord. Thus (it was) that We 



a (15) The essential difference between the version of this story given in the 
Bible and the version in the Quran is that while the Bible narrates it as a simple 
story, the Quran preserves in it the spiritual element. 

b (18) The Quran represents Jacob as doubting from the very first the 
sincerity of Joseph's brothers, but not so the Bible. Again, according to the Quran, 
Joseph relates his vision to his father, who is at once apprehensive of the envy of 
his brothers, if they are apprised of it; but according to the Bible, Jacob himself 
rebuked Joseph for his dream. Besides several discrepancies, the Bible narrative 
represents Jacob as an ordinary man, while the Quran represents him as a prophet.

might turn away from him evil and indecency. Surely he was one 
of Our chosen servants." 

25 And they raced with one another to the door, and she tore 
his shirt from behind, and they met her husband at the door. She 
said: What is the penalty for one who intends evil to jour wife, 
except imprisonment or a painful punishment? 26 He said: She 
sought to seduce me. And a witness of her own family bore wit- 
ness: If his shirt is torn in front, she speaks the truth and he is a 
liar. 27 And if his shirt is torn from behind, she tells a lie and he is 
truthful. 28 So when he saw his shirt torn from behind, he said: 
Surely it is an intrigue of you women. Your intrigue is indeed great! 
29 Joseph, turn aside from this. And (my wife), ask forgiveness for 
your sin. Surely you are one of the sinful. 

Section 4: Joseph is imprisoned 

30 And women in the city said: The chief's wife seeks to 
seduce her slave. He has indeed affected her deeply with (his) 
love. Truly we see her in clear error. 31 So when she heard of their 
scheming, c she sent for them and prepared for them a feast, and 
gave each of them a knife, and said (to Joseph): Come out to them. 
So when they saw him, they thought him great, and cut their hands 
(in amazement), and said: Holy Allah! This is not a mortal! This is 
but a noble angel. 32 She said: This is he about whom you blamed 
me. And certainly I sought to seduce him, but he was firm in self- 



a (24) This does not show that Joseph had any desire for her, but that the 
temptation was so strong that, if he had not been strengthened by great faith in 
God, he would have fallen a prey to mortal weakness. 

b (28) The vindication of Joseph's character on this occasion, and the pro- 
duction of the evidence of the shirt, are not related in the Bible. The next section 
proves that Joseph was not cast into prison for being guilty of having committed 
an outrage against his master's wife. 

c (31-1) Some think that she knew that certain women had circulated the 
news with the object of getting a chance to see Joseph. 

rf(31-2) The Egyptians were a superstitious and polytheistic people, and 
anything strange, or any human being about whom they witnessed anything won- 
derful, was considered by them to be a god. 



290 12. JOSEPH • 12 : 33 

restraint. And if he does not do what I order him, he shall certainly 
be imprisoned, and he shall certainly be degraded. 

33 He said: My Lord, the prison is dearer to me than that to 
which they invite me. And if You do not turn away their intrigue 
from me, I shall yearn towards them and be one of the ignorant. 
34 So his Lord accepted his prayer and turned away their intrigue 
from him. Surely He is the Hearer, the Knower. 35 Then it occurred 
to them after they had seen the signs that they should imprison him 
for a while." 

Section 5: Joseph's Preaching in Prison 

36 And two youths entered the prison with him. One of them 
said: I saw myself pressing wine. And the other said: I saw myself 
carrying bread on my head, from which birds were eating. Inform 
us of its interpretation; surely we see you to be from among the 
doers of good.* 

37 He said: The food with which you are fed shall not come 
to you, but I shall inform you of its interpretation before it comes 
to you. This is from what my Lord has taught me. Surely I have 
forsaken the religion of a people who do not believe in Allah, and 
are deniers of the Hereafter. 38 And I follow the religion of my 
fathers, Abraham and Isaac and Jacob. It does not befit us to set 
up any partner with Allah. This is by Allah's grace upon us and on 
mankind, but most people do not give thanks. 39 My two fellow- 
prisoners, are various lords better or Allah the One, the Supreme? 
40 You do not serve besides Him but names which you have 
named, you and your fathers — Allah has sent down no authority 
for them. Judgment is only Allah's. He has commanded that you 



a (35) There is nothing to show that Joseph was cast into prison on a charge 
of having committed an outrage on that woman. As he was proved guiltless of 
that charge, it is very likely that some other accusation was brought against him; 
and more probably an autocratic ruler needed no excuse for putting an innocent 
man into prison. By signs must be understood the signs of Joseph 's innocence. 

b (36) Compare Genesis, ch. 40, which, however, omits Joseph's preaching. 
The two youths were the butler and the baker. 



12:41' THE KING'S VISION INTERPRETED BY JOSEPH 291 

serve none but Him. This is the right religion, but most people do 
not know. 

41 My two fellow-prisoners, as for one of you, he will serve 
wine for his lord to drink; and as for the other, he will be cruci- 
fied, so that birds will eat from his head. The matter is decreed 
concerning which you inquired. 42 And he said to him whom he 
knew would be delivered of the two: Remember me with your lord. 
But the devil caused him to forget mentioning (it) to his lord, so 
he remained in the prison a few years. 

Section 6: The King's Vision interpreted by Joseph 

43 And the king said: I have seen seven fat cows which seven 
lean ones devoured, and seven green ears and (seven) others dry. 
Chiefs, explain to me my dream, if you can interpret the dream. 
44 They said: Confused dreams, and we do not know the interpre- 
tation of dreams. 45 And of the two, he who had found deliverance 
and remembered after a long time said: I will inform you of its 
interpretation, so send me. 

46 Joseph, truthful one, explain to us seven fat cows which 
seven lean ones devoured, and seven green ears and (seven) others 
dry, that I may go back to the people so that they may know. 47 He 
said: You shall sow for seven years as usual, then what you reap, 
leave it in its ear, except a little which you eat. 48 Then after that 
will come seven years of hardship, which will eat away all you 
have beforehand stored for them, except a little which you have 
preserved. 49 Then after that will come a year in which people will 
have rain and in which they will press (grapes). 

Section 7: Joseph cleared of the Charges 

50 And the king said: Bring him to me. So when the messen- 
ger came to him, he said: Go back to your lord and ask him, what 
is the case of the women who cut their hands? Surely my Lord 
knows their intrigue. 

51 (The king) said: What was your business when you sought 
to seduce Joseph? They said: Holy Allah! We knew of no evil on 
his part. The chief's wife said: Now has the truth come out. I sought 
to seduce him and he is surely truthful.

292 12. JOSEPH • 12 : 52 

52 (Joseph said:) This is that he might know that I have not 
been unfaithful to him in secret, and that Allah does not guide the 
plan of the unfaithful. * 53 And I do not call myself sinless; surely 
(man's) self is apt to command evil, except those on whom my 
Lord has mercy. Surely my Lord is Forgiving, Merciful. 

54 And the king said: Bring him to me, I will choose him for 
myself. So when he talked with him, he said: Surely you are in our 
presence today dignified, trusted. 55 He said: Place me (in autho- 
rity) over the treasures of the land; surely I am a good keeper, 
knowing well. 

56 And thus did We give to Joseph power in the land — he 
had mastery in it wherever he liked. We bestow Our mercy on 
whom We please, and We do not waste the reward of the doers of 
good. 57 And certainly the reward of the Hereafter is better for 
those who believe and guard against evil. 

Section 8: Joseph helps his Brothers 

58 And Joseph's brothers came and went in to (see) him, and 
he knew them, while they did not recognize him. s9 And when he 
furnished them with their provision, he said: Bring me a brother of 
yours from your father. Do you not see that I give full measure 
and that I am the best of hosts? 60 But if you do not bring him to 
me, you shall have no measure (of corn) from me, nor shall you 
come near me. 61 They said: We shall try to make his father yield 
about him, and we are sure to do (it). 62 And he said to his servants: 
Put their money into their bags that they may recognize it when 
they go back to their family, so that they may come back. 



a (52) These are the words of Joseph, who explains his conduct in preferring 
to remain in prison until his innocence was established. 

b (53) When a man addressed Jesus as good master, he said: "Why do you 
call me good? No one is good but One, that is, God" (Mark 10:18). The righteous 
never attribute any good to themselves, but attribute all good to the Great Source 
of goodness — God. Man's self is here called ammarah, i.e. one apt to command 
evil. It is the lowest stage in spiritual growth. See also 75:2 and 89:30. 



12 : 63 • JOSEPH HELPS HIS BROTHERS 293 

63 So when they returned to their father, they said: Our father, 
the measure is withheld from us, so send with us our brother that 
we may get the measure, and we will surely guard him. 64 He said: 
Can I trust you with him, except as I trusted you with his brother 
before? So Allah is the Best Keeper, and He is the most Merciful 
of those who show mercy. 

65 And when they opened their goods, they found their money 
returned to them. They said: Our father, what (more) can we 
desire? This is our property returned to us, and we shall bring corn 
for our family and guard our brother, and have in addition the 
measure of a camel-load. This is an easy measure. 66 He said: I will 
by no means send him with you, until you give me a firm promise 
in Allah's name that you will bring him back to me, unless you are 
completely surrounded. And when they gave him their promise, he 
said: Allah is Guardian over what we say. 67 And he said: My sons, 
do not enter by one gate but enter by different gates." And I cannot 
avail you against (the decree of) Allah at all. Judgment is only 
Allah's. On Him I rely, and on Him let the reliant rely. 

68 And when they entered as their father had instructed them, 
it did not avail them against Allah at all, but (it was only) a desire 
in the soul of Jacob, which he satisfied. And surely he was 
possessed of knowledge, because We had given him knowledge, 
but most people do not know. 

Section 9: The Youngest Brother 

69 And when they came to Joseph, he lodged his brother with 
himself, saying: I am jour brother, so do not grieve at what they do. 
70 Then when he furnished them with their provision, (someone) 



a (67) Jacob, it seems, had come to know by Divine revelation that Joseph 
was there, and therefore he ordered them to enter by different gates so that Joseph 
might find his brother. The next verse makes it clear when it says: And surely he 
was possessed of knowledge because We had given him knowledge. 

b (68) The Bible narrative represents Jacob as being quite ignorant in the 
matter. 



294 12. JOSEPH • 12 : 71 

placed the drinking-cup in his brother's bag. a Then a crier cried 
out: O caravan, you are surely thieves! 71 They said, turning towards 
them: What is it that you miss? 72 They said: We miss the king's 
drinking-cup, and he who brings it shall have a camel-load, and I 
am responsible for it. 73 They said: By Allah! You know for certain 
that we have not come to make mischief in the land, and we are 
not thieves. 74 They said: But what is the penalty for this, if you are 
liars? 75 They said: The penalty for this — the person in whose bag 
it is found, he himself is the penalty for it. Thus do we punish the 
wrongdoers. 

76 So he began with their sacks before the sack of his brother, 
then he brought it out from his brother's sack. Thus did We plan 
for the sake of Joseph. He could not take his brother under the 
king's law, unless Allah pleased. e We raise in degree whom We 
please. And above everyone possessed of knowledge is the All- 
Knowing One. 77 They said: If he steal, a brother of his did indeed 
steal before. But Joseph kept it secret in his mind, and did not 



a (70-1) Though the Bible narrative ascribes the placing of the cup to Joseph, 
the Quran does not say so. It may have been one of Joseph's own brothers who 
did this act so that Benjamin might also be removed from Jacob, who loved him 
most after Joseph. There is a clear hint to this possibility in v. 77, where Joseph 
accuses them of having done some guilty deed: "You are in an evil condition", 
and a still clearer hint in v. 89, where Joseph says: "Do you know how you treated 
Joseph and his brother, when you were ignorant?" 

b (70-2) It is a mistake to suppose that the crier was the very person who had 
placed the cup there. As v. 72 makes it clear, it was the king's drinking-cup; in 
other words it was not Joseph's personal property, but the property of the king, or 
government property. It is clear that the men who provided corn were different 
from those who had charge of the king's property. 

c (76) This makes it clear that this was not Joseph's plan, but a Divine plan. 
In other words, the circumstances were made to assist Joseph to keep his brother 
with him. Joseph's desire, no doubt, was to retain his brother Benjamin while the 
others returned; but he was unable to do so under the laws of Egypt, as stated 
here. This shows that one living under an alien government should abide by the 
laws of that government. 

d (77) The brothers of Joseph made a false statement against Joseph to cast a 
veil over their own evil deeds. If Benjamin, they said, was a thief, so was his 
brother Joseph, as if they meant to say that this evil trait of character was due to 
the mother, Rachel (probably referring to the incident in Genesis, 31:19). 



12 : 78 • JOSEPH DISCLOSES HIS IDENTITY 295 

disclose it to them. He said: You are in an evil condition, and Allah 
knows best what you state. 78 They said: O chief, he has a father, a 
very old man, so take one of us in his place. Surely we see you to 
be one of the doers of good. 79 He said: Allah forbid that we should 
seize other than him with whom we found our property, for then 
surely we should be unjust! 

Section 10: Joseph discloses his Identity 

80 So when they despaired of (persuading) him, they 
conferred together privately. The eldest of them said: Do you not 
know that your father took from you a promise in Allah's name, 
and how you fell short of your duty about Joseph before? So I 
shall not leave this land, until my father permits me or Allah decides 
for me; and He is the Best of the judges. 81 Go back to your father 
and say: Our father, jour son committed theft. And we bear 
witness only to what we know, and we could not keep watch over 
the unseen. 82 And ask the town where we were, and the caravan 
with which we proceeded. And surely we are truthful. 

83 (Jacob) said: No, your souls have contrived an affair for 
you, so patience is best. Maybe Allah will bring them together to 
me. Surely He is the Knowing, the Wise. 84 And he turned away 
from them, and said: My sorrow for Joseph! And his eyes were 
filled " (with tears) on account of the grief, then he repressed 
(grief). 85 They said: By Allah! Fou will not cease remembering 
Joseph till you are a prey to disease or you perish. 86 He said: I 
complain of my grief and sorrow only to Allah, and I know from 
Allah what you do not know. ' 87 My sons, go and inquire about 
Joseph and his brother, and do not despair of Allah's mercy. c 



a (84) The word used can carry the meaning of being filled. Even if we 
accept the ordinary significance, his eyes were whitened, the meaning is that they 
were whitened with tears, which naturally came at the mention of Joseph. 

b (86) This shows clearly that Jacob knew by Divine revelation that Joseph 
was alive. 

c (87) Here the Quran again differs from the Bible and shows that Jacob was 
so certain of Joseph being alive because of the knowledge he received from God, 
that he sent his sons a third time to Egypt to ascertain about Joseph. It appears that 
he had an inkling also that Joseph was in Egypt. 



296 12. JOSEPH • 12 : 88 

Surely none despairs of Allah's mercy except the disbelieving 
people. 

88 So when they came to him, they said: O chief, distress has 
afflicted us and our family, and we have brought little money, so 
give us full measure and be charitable to us. Surely Allah rewards 
the charitable. 89 He said: Do you know how you treated Joseph 
and his brother, when you were ignorant? 90 They said: Are you 
indeed Joseph? He said: I am Joseph and this is my brother; Allah 
has indeed been gracious to us. Surely he who keeps his duty and 
is patient — Allah never wastes the reward of the doers of good. 
91 They said: By Allah! Allah has indeed chosen you over us, and 
we were certainly sinners. 92 He said: There is no reproach against 
you this day. a Allah may forgive you, and He is the most Merciful 
of those who show mercy. 93 Take this shirt of mine and cast it 
before my father's face — he will come to know. And bring to 
me all your family. 

Section 1 1 : Jacob goes to Egypt 

94 And when the caravan left (Egypt), their father said: Surely 
I scent (the power of) Joseph, if you do not call me weak of mind. c 
95 They said: By Allah! you are surely in your old error. 

96 Then when the bearer of good news came, he cast it before 



a (92) It is related that the Holy Prophet took hold of the two sides of the 
gate of the Ka'bah on the day of the conquest of Makkah and said to the Quraish: 
How do you think I should treat you? They said: We hope for good, a noble 
brother and the son of a noble brother. Then he said: I say as my brother Joseph 
said: "There is no reproach against you this day". 

b (93) The Quran does not say anywhere that Jacob had become blind. The 
shirt was sent as being a reminder of the torn shirt of Joseph, which Joseph's 
brothers had brought to Jacob (v. 18). 

c (94) When the caravan in which were Joseph's brothers departed from 
Egypt, Jacob again received assurance from on high about Joseph, so he said to 
those around him that he scented the power of Joseph. Jacob knew that Joseph 
was alive and of this he informed his sons again and again, but he now told them 
further that he had received an assurance from God that Joseph occupied a high 
position. 



12 : 97 • JACOB GOES TO EGYPT 297 

his face so he became certain. He said: Did I not say to you that I 
know from Allah what you do not know? 97 They said: Our father, 
ask forgiveness of our sins for us, surely we are sinners. 98 He said: 
I shall ask forgiveness for you of my Lord. Surely He is the For- 
giving, the Merciful. 

99 Then when they came to Joseph, he lodged his parents 
with himself and said: Enter Egypt in safety, if Allah please. 
100 And he raised his parents on the throne," and they fell prostrate 
for his sake. And he said: My father, this is the significance of 
my earlier vision — my Lord has made it true. And He was indeed 
kind to me, when He brought me forth from the prison, and 
brought you from the desert after the devil had sown dissensions 
between me and my brothers. Surely my Lord is Benignant to 
whom He pleases. Truly He is the Knowing, the Wise. 101 My Lord, 
You have given me kingdom and taught me something of the inter- 
pretation of sayings. Originator of the heavens and the earth, You 
are my Friend in this world and the Hereafter. Make me die in 
submission and join me with the righteous. 

102 This is from the announcements relating to the unseen 
(which) We reveal to you, and you were not with them when they 
resolved upon their affair, and they were devising plans. e 103 And 
most people do not believe, though you desire it eagerly. 104 And 
you ask them no reward for it. It is nothing but a Reminder for the 
nations. 



a (100-1) The meaning may be that he placed them in a good position. 

b (100-2) Seeing the highly dignified position to which Joseph had been 
raised in Egypt, they all fell prostrate before God as a mark of thanksgiving. 

c (102) Throughout the Quran the "announcements relating to the unseen", 
as here, signify not the ancient histories of past prophets, but a repetition of those 
histories in the life of the Holy Prophet Muhammad. Thus from this verse 
onwards the subject is changed to the Holy Prophet's opponents. The reference in 
"when they resolved upon their affair, and they were devising plans" is to the 
resolution of the Quraish and their plans against the Prophet, for which see 8:30. 
The Quran does not relate stories for the sake of giving information of the past, 
but for the lessons which they afford for the future guidance of man. 



298 12. JOSEPH • 12 : 105 

Section 12: A Lesson for the Prophet's Opponents 

105 And how many a sign in the heavens and the earth do they 
pass by, yet they turn away from it! 106 And most of them do not 
believe in Allah without setting up partners (with Him). 107 Do they 
then feel secure from the coming to them of an all-encompass- 
ing punishment from Allah or from the coming to them of the hour 
suddenly, while they do not perceive? 

108 Say: This is my way; I call to Allah, with certain know- 
ledge — I and those who follow me. And glory be to Allah! and I 
am not of those who set up partners (with Allah). 109 And We did 
not send before you any but men, from the people of the towns, to 
whom We sent revelation. Have they not then travelled in the land 
and seen what was the end of those before them? And certainly 
the abode of the Hereafter is best for those who keep their duty. 
Do you not then understand? 110 Until, when the messengers des- 
paired and (the people) thought that they were told a lie," Our help 
came to them, and whom We pleased was delivered. And Our 
punishment is not averted from the guilty people. m In their histories 
there is certainly a lesson for those who have understanding. It is 
not a narrative which could be forged, but a verification of what is 
before it, and a distinct explanation of all things, and a guide and a 
mercy to a people who believe. 



a (110) "They" refers to the people, not messengers. The messengers warn 
their people, but the latter are so stubborn that the messengers at length despair of 
their people. The people, on the other hand, think that what the prophets had told 
them about the coming of the punishment was a lie. Then it is that the promised 
help for the prophets comes and the punishment with which the evildoers are 
threatened overtakes them. That the prophets never despair of Divine assistance 
coming to them, in accordance with Divine promise, is clear from what has already 
been said in v. 87 (see also 15:56 and 29:23). 



Chapter 13 
Ai-Ra'd Thunder 

This chapter is named Thunder from the analogy of rain which is often likened 
to revelation in the Quran. As rain is accompanied by thunder and lightening, 
so is revelation accompanied by warning of punishment, although its real 
purpose is mercy. The chapter points to signs in physical nature to the truth 
of revelation and deals with the demand from the disbelievers to see the sign 
of punishment befalling them. It then tells them about the Divine laws which 
govern reward and punishment, and explains that the real miracles were the 
spiritual life that the Quran awakened in people and the transformation it 
would bring in the world despite facing great mountains of obstacles. This 
chapter was revealed during the last four years of the period of the Holy 
Prophet's life at Makkah. 



Section 1 : Truth of Revelation 

In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful. 

1 I, Allah, am the Best Knower, the Seer." These are verses of 
the Book. And what is revealed to you from your Lord is the 
Truth, but most people do not believe. 2 Allah is He Who raised the 
heavens without any pillars that you can see, and He is established 
on the Throne of Power, and He made the sun and the moon 
subservient (to you). Each one runs to an appointed term. He 
regulates the affair, making clear the messages that you may be 
certain of the meeting with your Lord. 

3 And He it is Who spread the earth, and made in it firm 
mountains and rivers. And of all fruits He has made in it pairs, 



a (1) The original Arabic consists of the letters alif, lam, mim and ra. These 
stand for ana (I), Allah, A 'lam (Best Knower) and Ra'i, (Seer) respectively. 

b (2) All heavenly bodies are raised high without any pillars that man can 
see. Those pillars are the laws of gravitation. All heavenly bodies, we are further 
told, run their course to an appointed term; they have a beginning and an end, as 
all things on earth have a beginning and an end.

two (of every kind). He makes the night cover the day. Surely 
there are signs in this for a people who reflect. 4 And in the earth 
are tracts side by side, and gardens of vines, and corn, and palm- 
trees growing from one root and distinct roots — they are watered 
with one water; and We make some of them to excel others in 
fruit. Surely there are signs in this for a people who understand." 

5 And if you wonder, then wondrous is their saying: When we 
are dust, shall we then be raised in a new creation? These are they 
who disbelieve in their Lord, and these have chains on their necks,* 
and they are the companions of the Fire; in it they will abide. 
6 And they ask you to hasten on the evil before the good, and 
indeed there have been exemplary punishments before them. And 
surely your Lord is full of forgiveness for mankind despite their 
wrongdoing. And surely your Lord is Severe in retribution. 7 And 
those who disbelieve say: Why has not a sign been sent down to 
him from his Lord? Fou are only a warner and for every people 
a guide. 

Section 2: Fall and Rise of Nations

a (4) Unity in diversity is observable in the whole of nature, which is a sure 
sign of the Unity of the great Author of all existence. Besides this, as there is a 
difference in the produce of different tracts, though they are subject to the same 
laws of nature, even so are the hearts of people in relation to the growth of the 
seed of virtue, which is sown by revelation. 

b (5) The chains spoken of here are the chains which keep them constrained 
to evil usages and corrupt practices. 

c (6) The opponents of the Holy Prophet are told that the Merciful God would 
deal with them not according to their wrongdoings, but according to His vast and 
comprehensive forgiveness. But when evil outsteps all bounds, His very mercy, 
which must be exercised towards His righteous servants, requires that the wrong- 
doers should not be left without punishment. 

d (7) The words for every people a guide refer to the Holy Prophet. He was a 
warner indeed; he warned the evildoers of the evil consequences of their evil deeds, 
but he was ultimately to be a guide for every people, to lead them out of their evil 
ways and to set them on the right path. 



13:9" FALL AND RISE OF NATIONS 301 

fall short of completing and what they grow." And everything with 
Him has a measure. 9 The Knower of the unseen and the seen, the 
Great, the Most High. 10 Alike (to Him) among you is he who 
conceals the word and he who speaks openly, and he who hides 
himself by night and (who) goes forth by day.* n For him are 
(angels) guarding the consequences (of his deeds), before him and 
behind him, who guard him by Allah's command^ Surely Allah 
does not change the condition of a people, until they change their 
own condition. And when Allah intends harm to a people, there is 
no averting it, and besides Him they have no protector. 

12 He it is Who shows you lightning causing fear and hope 
and (Who) brings up the heavy cloud. 13 And thunder celebrates 
His praise, and the angels too for awe of Him. And He sends 
thunderbolts and strikes with them whom He pleases, yet they 
dispute concerning Allah, and He is Mighty in prowess. 

14 To Him is due the true prayer. And those to whom they 
pray besides Him give them no answer, but (they are) like one 
who stretches forth his two hands towards water that it may reach 
his mouth, but it will not reach it. And the prayer of the disbelie- 
vers is only wasted. 15 And whoever is in the heavens and the earth 
makes submission to Allah only, willingly and unwillingly, and 
their shadows, too, morning and evening. 

16 Say: Who is the Lord of the heavens and the earth? Say: 
Allah. Say: Do you then take besides Him, guardians who control 



a (8) The physical law of nature is spoken of here with a deeper reference to 
the spiritual law, according to which some receive a new birth through the 
Prophet and others do not. The subject is made clearer in the verses that follow. 

b (10) A general law is given expression to here, with a deeper reference to 
the secret and open counsels against the Holy Prophet and to enemies seeking his 
life by day and by night. 

c (11) While the statement is no doubt general and refers to the guardian 
angels referred to in 6:61, there is a deeper allusion to the Divine protection 
specially granted to the Holy Prophet against the numerous enemies among whom 
he lived day and night. The angels guard the consequences of the deeds of man, 
and are therefore spoken of here as guarding him, i.e., guarding whatever he does, 
by Allah's command.

no benefit or harm even for themselves? Say: Are the blind and 
the seeing alike? Or, are darkness and light equal? Or, have they 
set up with Allah partners who have created creation like His, so 
that what is created became confused to them? Say: Allah is the 
Creator of all things, and He is the One, the Supreme. 

17 He sends down water from the clouds, then watercourses 
flow according to their measure, and the torrent bears along the 
swelling foam. And a scum like it arises from what they melt in 
the fire for the sake of making ornaments or tools." Thus does 
Allah compare truth and falsehood. Then as for the scum, it passes 
away as a worthless thing; and as for that which benefits people, it 
remains behind in the earth. Thus does Allah set forth parables. 
18 For those who respond to their Lord is good. And as for those 
who do not respond to Him, even if they had all that is in the earth 
and as much again, they would certainly offer it for a ransom. As 
for those, theirs is an evil reckoning and their abode is hell; and 
evil is the resting-place. 

Section 3: Good and Evil bring their own Reward 

19 Is he who knows that what is revealed to you from your 
Lord is the truth, like him who is blind? Only those who have 
understanding are mindful — 20 those who fulfil the pact of Allah, 
and do not break the covenant, 21 and those who join what Allah 
has ordered to be joined c and have awe of their Lord, and fear the 
evil reckoning. 22 And those who are steadfast seeking the pleasure 



a (17-1) The word used includes here all kinds of things necessary for the 
life of man, such as utensils, tools, implements, and instruments of war. 

b (17-2) The parable set forth here signifies that the Holy Prophet and his 
followers will live and prosper, as they work for the good of mankind. On the 
other hand, evil practices and worthless usages and customs, as well as those who 
uphold them, will be swept away before the mighty current of Truth, as rubbish is 
borne away by a torrent. 

c (21) While the previous verse deals with people's duty to their Maker, this 
refers to relations with His creatures. "What Allah has ordered to be joined" 
includes all those ties of love and relationship which Allah has taught human 
beings to observe and keep inviolate. 



13:23' GOOD AND EVIL BRING THEIR OWN REWARD 303 

of their Lord, and keep up prayer and spend (on good works) out 
of what We have given them, secretly and openly, and repel evil 
with good; a theirs is the (happy) issue of the abode — 23 Gardens 
of perpetuity, which they will enter along with those who do good 
from among their fathers and their spouses and their offspring; 
and the angels will enter in upon them from every gate. 24 Peace be 
on you, because you were constant — how excellent is then the 
final abode! 

25 And those who break the covenant of Allah after its con- 
firmation, and cut apart what Allah has ordered to be joined, and 
make mischief in the land, for them is the curse, and theirs is the 
evil end of the abode. 26 Allah amplifies provision for whom He 
pleases, and restricts (it also). And they rejoice in this world's life. 
And this world's life, compared with the Hereafter, is only a 
temporary enjoyment. 

Section 4: Revolution to be brought about by the Quran 

27 And those who disbelieve say: Why is not a sign sent 
down to him by his Lord? c Say: Allah leaves in error whom He 



a (22) Evil is a thing which is by all means to be repelled, and hence good 
for evil is recommended only in cases when evil would be repelled by that good. 
Unconditionally requiting evil with good would abolish all safeguards; evildoers 
who received nothing but good for every evil they committed would most assuredly 
establish a condition of anarchy by their evil deeds. Elsewhere it is said: whoever 
forgives and brings about reform (42:40). 

b (23) The Quran is full of clear statements that women shall enjoy the bliss 
of paradise. Azwaj is the plural oizauj, which means either husband or wife, and 
hence I have rendered it as spouses. 

c (27-1) The answer to this question is given at the end of this section: 
"disaster will not cease to afflict them because of what they do, or it will reach 
close to their homes, until the promise of Allah come to pass" (v. 31). This promise 
related to the utter annihilation of the power of the disbelievers. The question, 
why is not a sign sent down to him, here as elsewhere in the Quran, is a demand 
for the promised annihilation of their power and their defeat, and the answer is 
always conveyed in somewhat similar terms, stating first that they should ask for 
mercy; that the Quran has healing power, the condition of the faithful being a 
witness to it; that the fate of the former generations affords a lesson; that smaller 
calamities continue to afflict them, and in these they can see the signs of their

who believe and whose hearts find rest in the remembrance of 
Allah. Now surely in Allah's remembrance do hearts find rest. 
29 Those who believe and do good, a good final state is theirs and a 
goodly return. 30 Thus We have sent you among a nation before 
which other nations have passed away, that you might recite to 
them what We have revealed to you, and (still) they deny the 
Beneficent. Say: He is my Lord, there is no god but He; in Him do 
I trust and to Him is my return. 

31 And if there could be a Quran with which the mountains 
were made to pass away, or the earth were split apart, or the dead 
were made to speak — indeed, the commandment is wholly Allah's. 
Do not those who believe know that, if Allah please, He would 
certainly guide all the people? And as for those who disbelieve, 
disaster will not cease to afflict them because of what they do, or 
it will reach close to their homes, until the promise of Allah come 
to pass. Surely Allah will not fail in (His) promise. 



ultimate vanquishment; and that finally, if all those tokens are rejected, the great 
calamity will not fail to overtake them. 

a (27-2) The contrast with those who turn to God makes it clear that Allah's 
pleasure to leave some in error is exercised only in the case of those who, though 
invited to God, do not turn to Him but choose to remain in error. The first part 
may also be translated thus: Allah leaves in error who will (remain in error). 

b (31) That the Quran should work such great wonders is not an impossi- 
bility but a fact, for we are immediately told that it will be brought about soon by 
Allah's commandment. At the time when these verses were revealed, difficulties 
in the spread of Islam appeared like mountains. It is a matter of history that they 
were made to pass away. The earth splitting apart means that the Quran would go 
deep down into the hearts of people, which are compared here to the earth. These 
words may also mean that the earth will be travelled over. There were no facilities 
at that time for going to distant corners of Arabia, to say nothing of the whole 
world. Yet not only was the whole of Arabia travelled over by the message- 
bearers of Islam within ten years after this, but within a hundred years of the 
Prophet's death Islam had traversed the whole of the known world, from the 
farthest East in China to the farthest West in Spain. It is again a matter of history 
that the dead were made to speak. People who were dead spiritually now spoke 
with such power that the whole earth from end to end responded to their call. 



13 : 32 • OPPOSITION WILL FAIL 305 



Section 5: Opposition will fail 

32 And messengers before you were certainly mocked, but I 
gave respite to those who disbelieved, then I seized them. How 
(terrible) was then My retribution! 33 Is, then, He Who watches 
every soul as to what it earns (like their associate gods)? And yet 
they ascribe partners to Allah! Say: Name them. a Would you 
inform Him of what He does not know in the earth, or of an out- 
ward saying? ' Rather, their plan is made to seem good to those 
who disbelieve, and they are kept back from the path. e And whom 
Allah leaves in error, he has no guide. 34 For them is punishment in 
this world's life, and the punishment of the Hereafter is certainly 
more grievous. And they have no protector against Allah. 

35 A parable of the Garden which is promised to those who 
keep their duty: In it flow rivers. Its fruits are perpetual and (so 
is) its plenty. Such is the end for those who keep their duty; and 
the end for the disbelievers is the Fire. 36 And those to whom We 
have given the Book rejoice in what has been revealed to you, e 
and some sects deny a part of it. Say: I am commanded only to 
serve Allah and not set up partners with Him. To Him do I invite 
(you), and to Him is my return. 37 And thus have We revealed it, a 



a (33-1) It is to show the utmost contempt for the alleged partners of the 
Divine Being that their worshippers are called upon to give them a name, as if it 
were said that they are not worthy of a name. Or the meaning may be, give them a 
name expressing any qualification of godhead, such as a sustainer, creator, etc. 

b (33-2) He knows both the inner feelings of man and his outward sayings, 
and He does not stand in need of a mediator. 

c (33-3) As stated in 29:38, it is the devil who makes their evil deeds seem 
good to people and keeps them back from the right path. 

rf(35) The paradise mentioned here is called a. parable, as also in 47:15. A 
saying of the Holy Prophet makes it clear that the blessings of paradise are such 
as no eye has seen, nor has ear heard, nor has it entered into the heart of man to 
conceive of them (Bukhari, 59:8). The description given in the Quran is only a 
likeness of what it actually is, as it is of a nature entirely different from the things 
of this world. 

e (36) The Book may signify the Quran; or it may refer to the previous 
revelation, in which case the Jewish and Christian converts to Islam are meant 
here.

true judgment, in Arabic. And if you follow their low desires after 
the knowledge that has come to you, you would have against Allah 
no guardian nor protector. 

Section 6: Steady Progress of Truth 

38 And certainly We sent messengers before you and appoin- 
ted for them wives and children. And it is not in the power of a 
messenger to bring a sign except by Allah's permission. For every 
term there is an appointment. 39 Allah effaces what He pleases and 
establishes (what He pleases), and with Him is the basis of the 
Book." 

40 Whether We show you part of what We promise them, or 
cause you to die (before it comes about), your duty is only to 
deliver the message, and Ours to call (them) to account. 41 Do they 
not see that We are visiting the land, curtailing it of its sides?* 
And Allah pronounces a doom — there is no repeller of His 
decree. And He is Swift in calling to account. 42 And those before 
them planned indeed, but all planning is Allah' s. c He knows what 
every soul earns. And the disbelievers will come to know for 
whom is the (good) end of the abode. 43 And those who disbelieve 
say: 7ou are not a messenger. Say: Allah is sufficient for a witness 
between me and you and whoever has knowledge of the Book. 



a (39) The Divine ordinance to annihilate the power of the opponents of the 
Holy Prophet and to bring about the establishment of the Truth is called the "basis 
of the Book" {Umm al-Kitab), because the final defeat of the powers of evil, 
which was previously foretold, would be such a clear sign that it would dispel all 
doubts. 

b (41) The reference in curtailing the sides may be either to some of the 
exalted men having come over to Islam and the opposition being thus weakened, 
or to the diminution of the number of disbelievers, both high and low, by people 
daily leaving their ranks and joining the ranks of Islam. 

c (42) The meaning is that the plans of the enemy need not be feared, for all 
their planning is controlled by Allah, or that the requital of their plans is in the 
hands of Allah. 

d (43) Those who have any knowledge of previous revelation will testify to 
the truth of the revelation of the Quran, because it fulfils all previous prophecies 
and satisfies the criteria of a true revelation. 



Chapter 14 
Ibrahim Abraham 

This chapter is named after Abraham, whose prayer is mentioned in verses 
35 — 41. It explains that the work of the Quran is to lead people out of darkness 
into light, but that previous prophets too, such as Moses, had their message 
rejected at first. However, in all cases the opposition failed and God's promise 
to help the prophet was fulfilled. Truth is confirmed and man brings about his 
own ruin by rejecting it. Then Abraham's prayer for the right guidance of his 
descendants is mentioned and we are told that opposition to the truth will 
always end in failure. This chapter was revealed during the last four years of 
the period of the Holy Prophet's life at Makkah. 



Section 1 : Revelation dispels Darkness 

In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful. 

1 I, Allah, am the Seer. A Book which We have revealed to 
you that you may bring forth people, by their Lord's permission, 
from darkness into light, to the way of the Mighty, the Praised 
One, 2 of Allah, Whose is whatever is in the heavens and whatever 
is in the earth. And woe to the disbelievers for the severe punish- 
ment! 3 Those who love this world's life more than the Hereafter, 
and turn away from Allah's path, and would have it crooked. 
Those are far astray. 

4 And We sent no messenger but with the language of his 
people, so that he might explain to them clearly/ Then Allah 
leaves in error whom He pleases and He guides whom He pleases. 
And He is the Mighty, the Wise. 

5 And certainly We sent Moses with Our messages, saying: 



a (4) Nothing is said here about the extent of the mission of the Holy 
Prophet, which was for all mankind; see 7:158. All that is said here is that every 
prophet is sent with the language of his people so that he may explain to his 
people, because it is his people who are the first recipients of his message.

308 14. ABRAHAM • 14 : 6 

Bring forth jour people from darkness into light and remind them 
of the days of Allah." In this are surely signs for every steadfast, 
grateful one. 6 And when Moses said to his people: Call to mind 
Allah's favour to you, when He delivered you from Pharaoh's 
people, who subjected you to severe torment, and slaughtered 
your sons and spared your women. And there was a great trial in it 
from your Lord. 

Section 2: Truth is rejected First 

7 And when your Lord made it known: If you are grateful, I 
will give you more, and if you are ungrateful, My punishment is 
truly severe. 8 And Moses said: If you are ungrateful, you and all 
those on earth, then Allah is surely Self-sufficient, Praised. 

9 Has not the account reached you of those before you, of the 
people of Noah and Ad and Thamud — and those after them? 
None knows them but Allah. Their messengers came to them 
with clear arguments, but they thrust their hands into their mouths e 
and said: We deny what you are sent with, and surely we are in 
serious doubt about that to which you invite us. 10 Their messen- 
gers said: Is there doubt about Allah, the Maker of the heavens 
and the earth? He invites you to forgive you your faults and to 
give you respite till an appointed term. They said: You are nothing 
but mortals like us; you wish to turn us away from what our 
fathers used to worship, so bring us clear authority. 



a (5) "The days of Allah" signify His merciful dealings with the righteous 
and His punishment of the wicked. 

b (9-1) The Quran does not claim to give a history of all the prophets; see 
4:164 and 40:78. The statement made here is much wider. It is claimed that no 
other book mentions them all; they are known only to Allah. 

c (9-2) This expression may mean their inability to give an answer, or that 
they bit their hands by reason of rage, or that they put their hands into the mouths 
of the messengers to silence them. 

d (9-3) The general statements made with regard to the messengers and the 
treatment of their people, in this and the following section, are particularly made 
in reference to the mission of the Prophet Muhammad, the opposition and enmity 
of his people, their turning him out of the city, and their final discomfiture. 



14:11* OPPOSITION IS AT LAST DESTROYED 309 

11 Their messengers said to them: We are nothing but mortals 
like yourselves, but Allah bestows (His) favours on whom He 
pleases of His servants. And it is not for us to bring you an autho- 
rity, except by Allah's permission. And on Allah let the believers 
rely. 12 And why should we not rely on Allah and He has indeed 
guided us in our ways? And we would certainly bear with patience 
your persecution of us. And on Allah should the reliant rely. 

Section 3: Opposition is at last destroyed 

13 And those who disbelieved said to their messengers: We 
will certainly drive you out of our land, unless you come back into 
our religion." So their Lord revealed to them: We shall certainly 
destroy the wrongdoers, 14 and We shall certainly settle you in the 
land after them. This is for him who fears standing in My presence 
and fears My threat. 15 And they sought judgment, and every 
insolent opposer was disappointed: 16 Hell is before him and he is 
given to drink boiling water; 17 he drinks it little by little and is not 
able to swallow it; and death comes to him from every quarter, yet 
he does not die. c And before him is vehement punishment. 

18 The parable of those who disbelieve in their Lord: Their 
works are as ashes on which the wind blows hard on a stormy day. 
They have no power over anything they have earned. That is 
straying far away. 19 Do you not see that Allah created the heavens 
and the earth with truth? If He please, He will take you away and 
bring a new creation, 20 and that is not difficult for Allah. 21 And 
they will all come forth to Allah, then the weak will say to those 
who were proud: We were your followers, can you then avert from 



a (13) This is no doubt equally a description of what the Holy Prophet was 
suffering at the hands of his enemies. 

b (14) This verse contains a very clear prophecy of the flight of the Holy 
Prophet from Makkah and of his re-entry into that city as a conqueror and ruler. 

c (17) He experiences, as it were, the pangs of death, but death, which would 
end all distress, does not come to him. 

d (20) V. 1 8 states that all the exertions of the opponents against the Prophet 
will be useless, while verses 19 and 20 warn the disbelievers that their power will 
come to an end and another people will take their place. 



310 14. ABRAHAM -14:22 

us any of the punishment of Allah? They will say: If Allah had 
guided us, we would have guided you. It is the same to us whether 
we cry or bear patiently; there is no escape for us. 

Section 4: Truth is confirmed 

22 And the devil will say, a when the matter is decided: Surely 
Allah promised you a promise of truth, and I promised you, then 
failed you. And I had no authority over you, except that I called 
you and you obeyed me; so do not blame me but blame your- 
selves. I cannot come to your help, nor can you come to my help. I 
deny your taking me as partner with Allah before. e Surely for the 
unjust is a painful punishment. 

23 And those who believe and do good are made to enter 
Gardens, in which rivers flow, abiding in them by their Lord's 
permission. Their greeting therein is, Peace! 24 Do you not see how 
Allah sets forth a parable of a good word as a good tree, whose 
root is firm and whose branches are high, "yielding its fruit in 



a (22-1) The devil mentioned in this verse is none other than the proud mis- 
leader of the preceding one. Compare also 37:30, where the very words we had no 
authority over you are put into the mouth of the leaders of evil from among man- 
kind. 

b (22-2) Whenever a person is misled into an evil deed, he finds in the end 
that the promise of a good consequence for an evil deed was only a deception. 
Compare 4:120 and 17:64. 

c (22-3) An alternative meaning: is / disbelieved because you took me as 
partner with Allah. In other words, the leaders disbelieve because their followers 
make them think by their flattery that they are worthy of being obeyed and 
followed. 

d (24) The parable likening a good word to a good tree follows immediately 
a description of the final abode of those who do good — Gardens in which rivers 
flow. A good word is like a good tree which gives its fruit in every season, and 
therefore the fruits which a man will find in paradise are only the fruits of his own 
good deeds. The trees of paradise are in fact man's own good deeds, which have 
grown into trees, bearing a fruit which is an embodiment of the spiritual fruits of 
the good deeds of this life. As good deeds are likened to fruit-bearing trees, faith 
is likened to water repeatedly in the Quran, being the source of physical life. It is 
for this reason that, just as the righteous are always spoken of as being those who 
believe and do good, paradise is always described as being a Garden in which 



14 : 26 • MAN'S INJUSTICE IN REJECTING TRUTH 3 1 1 

every season by the permission of its Lord? And Allah sets forth 
parables for people that they may be mindful. 26 And the parable of 
an evil word is as an evil tree pulled up from the earth's surface; it 
has no stability." 27 AUah confirms those who believe with the sure 
word in this world's life and in the Hereafter; and Allah leaves the 
wrongdoers in error; and Allah does what He pleases. 

Section 5: Man's Injustice in rejecting Truth 

28 Do you not see those who change Allah's favour for dis- 
belief e and make their people reach the abode of destruction — 
29 Hell. They will burn in it. And an evil place it is to settle in! 
30 And they set up equals with Allah to lead astray from His path. 
Say: Enjoy yourselves, for surely your return is to the Fire. 

31 Tell My servants who believe to keep up prayer and spend 
(on good works) out of what We have given them, secretly and 
openly, before the coming of the day in which there is no barter- 
ing, nor befriending. 32 Allah is He Who created the heavens and 
the earth and sent down water from the clouds, then brought forth 
with it fruits as a sustenance for you, and He has made the ships 
subservient to you to run their course in the sea by His command, 
and He has made the rivers subservient to you. rf 33 And He has 
made subservient to you the sun and the moon, pursuing their 
courses; and He has made subservient to you the night and the 
day. 34 And He gives you of all that you ask of Him. And if you 

rivers flow, the rivers corresponding to faith and the trees of the Garden corres- 
ponding to the good which a person does. 

a (26) The evil deed is likened to a tree whose roots do not go down into the 
earth, and in whose case, therefore, the process of nutrition must stop. Therefore 
an evil deed does not prosper and cannot bear any fruit. 

b (27) Allah does what He pleases, but it is the wrongdoers only, whom He 
leaves in error. The immediate cause of their going astray is their own iniquity. 

c (28) They reject Allah's favour, the Revelation, which aims at making

d (32) The whole of creation is here, and in the next verse, declared to be 
made subservient to man, to show his high place in creation. How much then does 
man degrade himself by worshipping things which were made to serve him!

man is very unjust, very ungrateful. 

Section 6: Abraham's Prayer 

35 And when Abraham said: My Lord, make this city secure, 
and save me and my sons from worshipping idols. " 36 My Lord, 
surely they have led many people astray.* So whoever follows me, 
he is surely of me; and whoever disobeys me, You surely are For- 
giving, Merciful. c 37 0ur Lord, I have settled a part of my off- 
spring in a valley unproductive of fruit near Your Sacred House, 
our Lord, that they may keep up prayer; so make the hearts of 
some people yearn towards them, and provide them with fruits; 
perhaps they may be grateful. 38 0ur Lord, surely You know what 
we hide and what we proclaim. And nothing is hidden from Allah, 
either in the earth or in the heaven. 

39 Praise be to Allah, Who has given me, in old age, Ishmael 
and Isaac! Surely my Lord is the Hearer of prayer. 40 My Lord, 



a (35) That idolatry received a death-blow from the hands of one of Abra- 
ham's descendants shows that Abraham's prayer was not in vain. 

b (36-1) Idols do not actually lead people astray; the meaning is that it is on 
account of them that people go astray. 

c (36-2) The prayer of Abraham is in fact the prayer of the Holy Prophet and 
illustrates the breadth of his view. Those who follow him are, of course, his own, 
but he does not reject even those who disobey him, for he prays for Allah's mercy 
and protection even for them. 

d (37) According to a Hadith report (Bukhari, 60:9), Abraham brought Hagar 
and Ishmael, and settled them near the ruins of the Sacred House, the Ka'bah. This, 
as the hadith states, was done under a Divine commandment. For when Abraham 
was going back, on leaving them both in this wilderness, where there was no town 
at this time, Hagar asked him, Is it by Allah's commandment that you are doing 
this? Abraham's reply was, Yes. Then said Hagar: "Allah will not leave us to 
perish". It is further stated that, when no water was left with her, Hagar ran to and 
fro, between the Safa and the Marwah, to find out if there was any caravan going 
that way. It was on this occasion that she saw an angel, who pointed to her a place 
where she could find water. This was the place known now as Zamzam. It was 
due to this water that some people settled there. Even the Bible accepts that 
Ishmael's descendants settled in Arabia.

make me keep up prayer and (those) from my offspring (too), our 
Lord, and accept my prayer. 4 iOur Lord, grant me protection and 
my parents and the believers on the day when the reckoning comes 
to pass. 

Section 7: The End of Opposition 

42 And do not think Allah to be heedless of what the unjust 
do. He only gives them respite to a day when the eyes will stare 
(in terror), 43 hastening forward, their heads upraised, their gaze 
not returning to them, and their hearts vacant." 44 And warn people 
of a day when the punishment will come to them, then the wrong- 
doers will say: Our Lord, grant us respite for a short while, we 
will respond to Your call and follow the messengers. Did you not 
swear before, that there will be no passing away for you? 45 And 
you dwell in the abodes of those who wronged themselves, and it 
is clear to you how We dealt with them and We made (them) 
examples for you. 46 And they have indeed planned their plan, and 
their plan is with Allah, though their plan is such that the moun- 
tains should be moved by it. 

47 So do not think that Allah will fail in His promise to His 
messengers. Surely Allah is Mighty, the Lord of retribution. 48 0n

the heavens (as well), c and they will come forth to Allah, the One, 



a (43) The striking of terror into the hearts of those who opposed the Prophet 
was witnessed in this very life, when the Prophet advanced on Makkah. The 
vacancy or blankness of the heart indicates a state of great terror. 

b (46) The reference is to the plan of the Quraish to put an end to the 
Prophet's life, when he was left almost alone in Makkah. The words their plan is 
with Allah signify that their plan is controlled by Allah, Who will make it ineffec- 
tive. A wonderful prophecy indeed in the mouth of a man whose only chance of 
saving himself now lay in escaping from his enemies, while they were taking 
every precaution not to allow him to escape, having decided to put him to death! 

c (48) The transformation wrought by the Holy Prophet no doubt changed 
the earth into a different earth and the heaven into a new heaven. The Arabia at 
the birth of the Prophet was not the Arabia at his death. Beliefs, usages, and prac- 
tices, which had baffled all attempts at reformation for centuries, were swept away, 
and the ignorant, superstitious, and warring tribes had become a single nation,

may be mindful.

was blotted out of existence so completely that no vestige of it could be found 
among a people who had remained addicted to it for centuries. And that great 
change must now come over the whole world. But the spiritual resurrection is 
only an indication of the great day of Resurrection. 

a (49) The powerful opponents of the Prophet were brought before him 
linked together in chains in this very life, at the battle of Badr. These promises 
were fulfilled in this life to show that they were equally true as regards the next. 



Chapter 15 
Ai-mjr The Rock 

This chapter is named The Rock after the Dwellers of the Rock mentioned in 
v. 80, whose fate is a warning to those who sought to kill the Holy Prophet. 
The chapter begins with the grand promise that the Quran shall forever be 
guarded against all corruption and all attempts to annihilate it (v. 9). It goes 
on to declare that evil-doers cannot inflict any injury on the chosen ones of 
God and that the devil's opposition has always failed. Then it gives examples 
of how opponents of previous prophets were destroyed. This chapter was 
revealed at Makkah.

Section 1: The Quran is guarded 

In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful. 

1 I, Allah, am the Seer. These are the verses of the Book and 
(of) a Quran that makes clear. 

2 Often will those who disbelieve wish that they were Muslims." 
3 Leave them to eat and enjoy themselves, and let (false) hope be- 
guile them, for they will soon know. 4 And never did We destroy a 
town but it had a decree made known. 5 No people can hasten on 
their doom, nor postpone it. 

6 And they say: Fou, to whom the Reminder is revealed, you 
are indeed mad. 7 Why do you not bring the angels to us, if you are 
truthful? 8 We do not send angels but with truth, and then they 



a (2) The passage does not refer only to life after death. The opponents, who 
thought Islam would soon be annihilated, must no doubt have felt after in life, when 
the truth of Islam became manifest, that it would have been much better for them 
if they had accepted Islam at the first call of the Prophet. 

b (7) The words if you are truthful clearly show that the coming of angels is 
demanded in relation to the fulfilment of prophecies. In the next verse they are 
told that the angels will be sent, in accordance with the requirements of truth and 
justice, when they are required to execute the judgment of the doom of the 
opponents.

would not be given respite. 'Surely We have revealed the Reminder, 
and surely We are its Guardian." 

10 And certainly We sent (messengers) before you among the 
sects of old. n And never did a messenger come to them but they 
mocked him. 12 Thus do We make it enter the hearts of the guilty * 
— 13 they do not believe in it; and the example of the ancients has 
gone before. 14 And even if We open to them a gate of heaven, and 
they keep on ascending into it, 15 they would say: Only our eyes 
have been covered over, rather we are a people under enchant- 
ment^ 

Section 2: Forces of Evil will be destroyed 

16 And certainly We have made strongholds in the heaven, 
and We have made it attractive for the onlookers, 17 and We guard 
it against every accursed devil, 18 but he who steals a hearing; so 
there follows him a visible flame. d 



a (9) This is one of the most wonderful prophecies, whose fulfilment is, and 
will ever remain, a standing testimony to the truth of the Holy Quran, that the Quran 
will for all time be preserved safe against all attempts to destroy it and from every 
kind of corruption. The fulfilment of this prophecy is so evident a fact that a hostile 
writer like Sir William Muir admitted that "there is probably in the world no other 
work which has remained twelve centuries with so pure a text" (The Life of 
Mahomet, 1861, ch. 1). In the whole length and breadth of the Islamic world there 
does not exist a single copy with any variation from the recognized text, and thus 
not only was the Quran preserved from destruction against a powerful enemy, but 
it has also been preserved from corruption. 

b (12) Thus refers to the mockery mentioned in the previous verse. Due to 
their mockery, it enters their hearts not to believe in the Divine message. 

c (15) Verses 14-15 speak of the hardness of their hearts. They were deter- 
mined to reject the truth and did not pay any attention to the clearest evidence. 

d (18) The three verses 16-18 speak of the soothsayers and the diviners, who 
were among the opponents of the Holy Prophet; they pretended to receive 
communications from on high. We are here told that they were really driven from 
the Divine presence, and therefore could not have any access to that source of 
purity. In speaking of the divinations as being followed by a visible flame, it is 
indicated that they meet with failure and disappointment. The description of spiri- 
tual truths in words relating to physical laws prevailing in the world is of common 
occurrence in the Quran. 



15 : 19 • FORCES OF EVIL WILL BE DESTROYED 317 

19 And the earth — We have spread it out and made in it firm 
mountains and caused to grow in it of every suitable thing. 20 And 
We have made in it means of subsistence for you and for those 
(creatures) for whom you do not provide. 21 And there is not a 
thing but with Us are the treasures of it, and We do not send it 
down but in a known measure. 22 And We send the winds fertili- 
zing, then send down water from the clouds," so We give it to you 
to drink; nor is it you who store it up. 23 And surely it is We, Who 
give life and cause death, and We are the Inheritors. 

24 And certainly We know those among you who go forward 
and We certainly know those who lag behind. 25 And surely jour 
Lord will gather them together. He indeed is Wise, Knowing. 

Section 3: The Devil's Opposition to the Righteous 

26 And surely We created man of sounding clay, of black mud 
fashioned into shape. 27 And the jinn, We created before of intensely 
hot fire. 28 And when jour Lord said to the angels: I am going to 



a (22) The fertilizing winds represent the signs of the progress of Islam before 
its final triumph, which is indicated by the rain from the clouds. 

b (23) One who inherits is the one who remains after another has perished. 
The announcement made here is a prophecy that the true worshippers of Allah 
will be heirs in the land while the others will perish. 

c (25) One meaning is that those who are foremost in accepting truth and 
those who lag behind in accepting it will all be gathered together, i.e., ultimately 
those who now lag behind will be brought over to the right course. 

d (27) See also 7:12 footnote. Man's creation from dust also refers to his low 
and humble origin and his temperate nature, as opposed to another kind of crea- 
tion of a fiery nature, which is called the/inn or the devil. The two words, jinn and 
devil, are frequently applied to men of a fiery temperament or rebellious nature 
who lead others to evil. These descriptions of the creation of men and jinn axe, 
allegorical, referring respectively to the nature of those who are submissive to 
Divine laws and those who rebel against them, and the allegory is carried on 
further in what is stated of the rebellion of the devil against Adam. The two des- 
criptions of the origin of man, his being made from clay that gives sound and of 
mud that is fashioned into shape, refer to the two great characteristics which give 
man a superiority over other animals, namely, his use of language and the perfec- 
tion of his make.

create a mortal of sounding clay, of black mud fashioned into shape. 
29 So when I have made him complete and breathed into him of My 
spirit," fall down making submission to him. 30 So the angels sub- 
mitted, all of them together — 31 but not IblTs. He refused to be 
with those who submitted. 

32 He said: O IblTs, what is the reason that you are not with 
those who submit? 33 He said: I am not going to submit to a mortal, 
whom You have created of sounding clay, of black mud fashioned 
into shape. 34 He said: Then go forth, for surely you are driven 
away, 35 and surely on you is a curse till the day of Judgment. 36 He 
said: My Lord, grant me respite till the day when they are raised. 
37 He said: Surely you are granted respite, 38 till the day of the time 
made known. 

39 He said: My Lord, as You have judged me to be in error/ 
I shall certainly make (evil) seem good to them on earth, and I 
shall cause them all to deviate, 40 except Your servants from among 
them, the purified ones. 41 He said: This is a right way with Me. 
42 As regards My servants, you have no authority over them except 
such of the deviators as follow you. 43 And surely hell is the pro- 
mised place for them all — 44 it has seven gates. For each gate is 
an appointed portion of them. e 



a (29) This shows that man is made complete when the Divine spirit is 
breathed into him. The Divine spirit (Arabic: riih) does not mean here the animal 
soul in man, but the spirit of Allah that gives him perfection. 

b (36) When a man is raised to life spiritually, the suggestions and the 
promptings of the devil cease to affect him. But until he finds spiritual life, evil 
suggestions mislead him now and then. This is the "time made known" in v. 38. 

c (39) The meaning is clearly "as You have judged me to be in error" and not 
caused me to be in error. 

d (42) In a broad sense all people are servants of Allah. That the devil has no 
authority over them is clear from 14:22, where the devil says to his followers: "I had 
no authority over you, except that I called you and you obeyed me." 

e (44) The seven gates mean the seven ways which lead into it, according to 
which there are seven different names of hell in the Quran. However, the numeral 
seven in Arabic often stands for a large number, so that the meaning may be that 
there are many gates or many ways leading to it.

Section 4: Mercy for the Righteous — Abraham 

45 Surely those who keep their duty are in Gardens and foun- 
tains. 46 Enter them in peace, secure. 47 And We shall remove what- 
ever of bitterness is in their hearts — as brothers, on thrones, facing 
each other. 48 Toil does not afflict them therein, nor will they be 
ejected from there." 49 Inform My servants that I am the Forgiving, 
the Merciful, 50 and that My punishment — that is the painful 
punishment. 

51 And inform them of the guests of Abraham. 52 When they 
came to him, they said, Peace! He said: We are afraid of you. 
53 They said: Do not be afraid, we give you good news of a boy, 
possessing knowledge. 54 He said: Do you give me good news when 
old age has come upon me? Of what then do you give me good 
news? 55 They said: We give you good news with truth, so do not 
be from among the despairing ones. 56 He said: And who despairs 
of the mercy of his Lord except those in error? 

57 He said: What is your business, then, messengers? 58 They 
said: We have been sent to a guilty people, 59 except Lot's follow- 
ers. We shall deliver them all, 60 except his wife: We ordained that 
she shall surely be among those who remain behind. 

Section 5: Lot and Shuaib 

61 So when the messengers came to Lot's followers, 62 he 
said: Surely you are an unknown people. 63 They said: Indeed, we 
have come to you with that about which they disputed. 64 And we 
have come to you with the truth, and we are surely truthful. 



a (48) Such is the Muslim paradise. There is absolute peace of mind, perfect 
security from any inclination to evil or any other danger (v. 46); there is a bro- 
therhood in which no one conceals any rancour in his heart for his brother, nor has 
anyone a complaint against another (v. 47); and lastly, there is neither toil nor fati- 
gue, nor is one to be ever deprived of that state of perfect bliss (v. 48). This verse 
further establishes that those who are once made to enter paradise are not sent 
back to this world; and that therefore the garden in which Adam was at first 
placed was not the paradise of heavenly life, for in that case he would not have 
been ejected from it.

decree, that the roots of these should be cut off in the morning. 

67 And the people of the town came rejoicing. 68 He said: 
These are my guests, so do not disgrace me, 69 and keep your duty 
to Allah and do not shame me. 70 They said: Did we not forbid you 
from (entertaining) people? 71 He said: These are my daughters, if 
you are going to do anything. " 72 By your life! they blindly wan- 
dered on in their frenzy. 73 So the cry overtook them at sunrise; 
74 thus We turned it upside down, and rained upon them stones, as 
decreed. 75 Surely in this are signs for those who take a lesson. 
76 And it is on a road that still abides. 77 Surely in this is a sign for 
the believers.

80 And the dwellers of the Rock indeed rejected the messen- 
gers; 81 and We gave them Our messages, but they turned away 
from them; 82 and they carved houses in the mountains, in security. 
83 So the cry overtook them in the morning; 84 and what they earned 
did not avail them. 

85 And We did not create the heavens and the earth and all 
that is between them but with truth. And the Hour is surely com- 
ing, so turn away with kindly forgiveness. 6 86 Surely your Lord —

Hijaz to Syria.

turn away from those who set up partners (with Allah). 95 Surely

conquest of Makkah, when, having captured the city which had most tyrannically 
driven him out with his followers, and whose people were guilty of shedding the 
innocent blood of the Muslims, he forgave all. 

a (87) The Holy Prophet is reported to have said that the "seven oft-repeated 
verses" were the seven verses of the Fatihah, the first chapter of the Quran. 
(Bukhari, 65:1). According to the same hadith, the Fatihah is called the grand 
Quran. It is so called because it contains the essence of the whole of the Quran. 

b (88) The riches and embellishments of this life had no temptation for the 
Holy Prophet. The unequalled simplicity of his life from the time that he married 
a rich widow to the time that he ruled Arabia may be guessed from the last scene 
of his life, when he ordered the last penny in his house to be given to the poor. 
The verse, moreover, draws a picture of the utmost kindness and gentleness which 
he showed to his followers. The straining of the eyes signifies looking desirously. 

c (99) What is certain is here generally taken to mean death (Bukhari, 
65.15:5), because it is the one thing which is certain to come to every creature. 



Chapter 16 
Ai-NaM The Bee 

This chapter is so named because the bee, guided by its instinct which is called 
"revelation" in 16:68, gathers honey from flowers by taking the best of what 
is in them, producing "a beverage of many colours in which there is healing 
for human beings" (16:69). Similarly, Divine revelation to the Holy Prophet 
collected the best in previous revealed teachings and presented it in the Quran, 
which is also called "a healing" for people (10:57). 

This chapter begins by mentioning the benefits which God has conferred 
upon man in physical nature to show that He also bestows upon him spiritual 
gifts. Those who reject these gifts will come to disgrace but God is slow to 
punish. Revelation is necessary, but not every person can receive it directly. 
The best ones are chosen for it. Revelation teaches the doing of good, and the 
Quran replaces previous revelation. Those who reject it are then compared to 
a flourishing town which is made to suffer because of the ingratitude of its 
people. Lastly, Muslims are given certain golden directions to follow in order 
to be a great nation. This chapter was revealed in the last period at Makkah. 



Section 1 : Revelation testified to by Nature 

In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful. 

1 Allah's commandment will come, so do not seek to hasten 
it. a Glory be to Him, and supremely exalted is He above what they 
set up as partners (with Him)! 2 He sends down angels with reve- 
lation by His command on whom He pleases of His servants, 
saying: Give the warning that there is no God but Me, so keep 
your duty to Me. 3 He created the heavens and the earth with truth. 
Supremely exalted is He above what they set up as partners (with 
Him)! 



a (1) The disbelievers are asked not to hasten the punishment, for Allah, 
Who conferred so many physical benefits on them, and is willing to bestow His 
spiritual gifts, as mercy has the foremost place in Divine nature. This is stated in 
the verses that follow. What that punishment was going to be is expressly stated at 
the end of this chapter (v. 1 12).

16:4« NATURE UPHOLDS UNITY 323 

4 He created man from a small life-germ," and lo! he is an 
open contender. 5 And the cattle, He has created them for you. You 
have in them warm clothing and (other) advantages, and of them 
you eat. 6 And therein is beauty for you, when you drive them back 
(home) and when you send them out (to pasture). 7 And they carry 
your heavy loads to regions which you could not reach but with 
distress to yourselves. Surely your Lord is Compassionate, Merci- 
ful. 8 And (He made) horses and mules and asses that you might 
ride upon them and as an ornament. And He creates what you do 
not know. 9 And upon Allah it rests to show the right way, and there 
are some deviating (ways). And if He please, He would guide all 
of you aright. 

Section 2: Nature upholds Unity 

10 He it is Who sends down water from the clouds for you; it 
gives drink, and by it (grow) the trees on which you feed. n He 
causes to grow for you by it vegetation, and the olives, and the 
date-palms, and the grapes, and all the fruits. Surely there is a sign 
in this for a people who reflect. 12 And He has made subservient to 
you the night and the day and the sun and the moon. And the stars 
are made subservient by His command. Surely there are signs in 
this for a people who understand. 13 And what He has created for 
you in the earth is of varied colours. Surely there is a sign in this 
for a people who are mindful. 14 And He it is Who has made the 
sea subservient that you may eat fresh flesh from it and bring forth 
from it ornaments which you wear. And you see the ships cleaving 
through it, so that you seek of His bounty and that you may give 
thanks. 15 And He has cast firm mountains in the earth in case it 
should quake with you, and rivers and roads that you may go aright,

b (15) These words seem to point to the great upheavals and the violent agita- 
tions which led to the formation of the mountains, before man's existence on earth, 
and, that having been effected, the convulsions are now comparatively insigni- 
ficant, making life possible. But these words can also be translated as meaning 
that they may be a source of benefit to you. In accordance with this we have else- 
where: "And the mountains, He made them firm, a provision for you and for your 
cattle" (79:32-33).

17 Is He then Who creates like him who does not create? Are 
you not then mindful? 18 And if you would count Allah's favours, 
you would not be able to number them. Surely Allah is Forgiving, 
Merciful. 19 And Allah knows what you conceal and what you do 
openly. 20 And those whom they call on besides Allah created 
nothing, while they are themselves created. 21 Dead (are they), not 
living. And they do not know when they will be raised." 

Section 3: Denial due to Ignorance 

22 Your God is one God: so those who do not believe in the 
Hereafter, their hearts refuse to know and they are proud. 
"Undoubtedly Allah knows what they conceal and what they do 
openly. Surely He does not love the proud. 24 And when it is said 
to them, What is it that your Lord has revealed, they say, Stories 
of the ancients! 25 That they may bear their burdens in full on the 
day of Resurrection, and also part of the burdens of those whom 
they lead astray without knowledge. Ah! evil is what they bear. 

Section 4: The Wicked will come to Disgrace 

26 Those before them plotted, so Allah demolished their build- 
ing from the foundations, so the roof fell down on them from 
above them, and the punishment came to them from where they 
did not perceive. 27 Then on the day of Resurrection He will bring 
them to disgrace and say: Where are My partners, for whose sake 
you became hostile? Those who are given the knowledge will say: 
Surely disgrace this day and evil are upon the disbelievers,* 
28 whom the angels cause to die, while they are unjust to them- 
selves. Then would they offer submission: We did not do any evil. 



a (21) These two verses show conclusively that neither Jesus Christ nor any 
other person who is taken for a god ever created anything; and secondly, that 
Jesus was not alive at the time of the revelation of the Quran: Dead are they, not 
living. The further statement that they do not even know when they will be raised, 
shows that the verse speaks of men taken for gods, and at any rate includes them. 

b (27) Disgrace is a sort of hell-fire, which they had in this very life, too. 



16:29* THE WICKED WILL COME TO DISGRACE 325 

Yes! Surely Allah knows what you did. 29 So enter the gates of 
hell, to abide in it. Evil indeed is the dwelling-place of the proud. 

30 And it is said to those who guard against evil: What has 
your Lord revealed? They say, Good. For those who do good in 
this world is good. And certainly the abode of the Hereafter is 
better. And excellent indeed is the abode of those who keep their 
duty — 31 Gardens of perpetuity which they enter, in which rivers 
flow: they have therein what they please. Thus does Allah reward 
those who keep their duty, 32 whom the angels cause to die in 
purity, saying: Peace be on you! enter the Garden for what you 
did. 

33 They only wait that the angels should come to them or that 
your Lord's command should come to pass." Thus did those before 
them. And Allah did not wrong them, but they wronged them- 
selves. 34 So the evil of what they did afflicted them, and what they 
mocked at beset them. 

Section 5: Prophets are raised to explain 

35 And the idolaters say: If Allah pleased we would not have 
served any but Him, (neither) we nor our fathers, nor would we 
have prohibited anything without (order from) Him. Thus did 
those before them. But have the messengers any duty except to 
deliver the message clearly? ° 36 And certainly We raised in every 
nation a messenger, saying: Serve Allah and shun the devil. Then 
some of them Allah guided, and for some of them remaining in 



a (33) The coming of the angels stands for the smaller afflictions, such as 
overtook them in the form of famine and war, while the coming to pass of the 
command of the Lord indicates the complete overthrow of their power. 

b (34) The past tense is used to express the highest degree of certainty rela- 
ting to the future. 

c (35) They contended that if Allah did not like evil He could have diverted 
them from evil ways. They are told in reply that Allah's pleasure is not exercised 
by compelling people to adopt one way or the other, but by sending His messen- 
gers in every age and to every nation to point out the right way to the people, and 
by clear messages through His messengers to warn people to avoid evil.

error was justly due." So travel in the land, then see what was the 
end of the rejectors. 37 If you desire their guidance, yet Allah will 
not guide him who leads (others) astray,* nor do they have any 
helpers. 

38 And they swear by Allah their most energetic oaths: Allah 
will not raise up him who dies. Yes indeed! It is a promise binding 
on Him, quite true, but most people do not know: 39 So that He 
might make clear to them what they differ about, and that those 
who disbelieve might know that they were liars. 40 Our word for a 
thing, when We intend it, is only that We say to it: Be; and it is. 

Section 6: Doom of Opponents is coming 

41 And those who flee for Allah's sake after they are opp- 
ressed, We shall certainly give them a good abode in the 
world; and the reward of the Hereafter is much greater, if only 
they knew c — 42 those who are steadfast and on their Lord they 
rely. 

43 And We did not send before you any but men to whom We 
sent revelation — so ask the followers of the Reminder if you do 
not know — 44 with clear arguments and Scriptures. And We 



a (36) There were some people who did not care for the Prophet's warning 
and adhered to error. Justice therefore required that they should be left in error. 
The message was sent by God; the choice was man's own to accept or reject it. 
The words do not mean that Allah had foredoomed some people, for then the 
sending to them of messengers would have been absurd. 

b (37) Those who not only walk in error themselves, but have grown so hos- 
tile to the cause of Truth that they mislead others, cannot find the right way, how- 
ever much the Prophet may be anxious for them. 

c (41) Here is a clear prophecy regarding those Muslims who had to flee their 
homes on account of the persecutions of the Quraish. They are promised not only 
a reward of the Hereafter but a good abode in this world, too. Those who fled their 
homes in utter helplessness, and were in danger of their very lives, were given the 
clearest promise of a great future in this life, and this promise proved true despite 
the hard struggle of a powerful nation to exterminate Islam. 

d (43) By the followers of the Reminder are generally understood the Jews 
and the Christians, to whom the disbelievers of the Quraish are referred. But the

people what has been revealed to them, and that perhaps they may 
reflect. 

45 Are they, then, who plan evil (plans), secure that Allah will 
not humble them in the earth, or that punishment will not come 
upon them from where they do not perceive? 46 0r that He will not 
seize them in their going to and fro, then they will not be able to 
escape? 47 0r that He will not seize them with a gradual reduc- 
tion?" Your Lord is surely Compassionate, Merciful. 48 Do they not 
see everything that Allah has created? Its (very) shadows return 
from right and left, making submission to Allah, while they are in 
utter humility. 49 And to Allah submits every living creature that is 
in the heavens and that is in the earth, and the angels (too) and they 
are not proud. 50 They fear their Lord above them and do what they 
are commanded. 

Section 7: Human Nature revolts against Polytheism 

51 And Allah has said: Do not take two gods. He is only one 
God: So Me alone should you fear. 52 And whatever is in the 
heavens and the earth is His, and to Him is obedience due always. 
Will you then fear other than Allah? 53 And whatever good you 
have, it is from Allah; then, when evil afflicts you, to Him do you 
cry for aid. 54 Then when He removes the evil from you, lo! some 
of you set up partners with their Lord, 55 so as to deny what We 
have given them. Then enjoy yourselves, for soon will you know. 
56 And they set apart for what they do not know, a portion of what 

mention in the very next verse of the Reminder being sent to the Holy Prophet 
shows that the words apply to the Muslims. Some commentators take the words 
generally as meaning learned men. 

a (47) As verses 41 — 42 speak of a prosperous future for those who accepted 
the truth and now were suffering the severest persecutions, verses 45^47 speak 
prophetically of the different forms of punishment to which the persecutors of the 
righteous were to be subjected, v. 47 stating that they would be reduced gradually. 
This was their end, as their power went on waning till the whole of Arabia bowed 
before Islam. 

b (56) That is, for the idols or their gods, whom they ignorantly take for 
intercessors.

about what you forged. 

57 And they ascribe daughters to Allah. Glory be to Him! 
And for themselves is what they desire! 58 And when the birth of a 
daughter is announced to one of them, his face becomes dark and 
he is full of wrath. 59 He hides himself from the people because of 
the evil of what is announced to him. Shall he keep it with disgrace 
or bury it (alive) in the dust? Now surely evil is what they judge!" 
60 For those who do not believe in the Hereafter are evil attributes 
and Allah's are the sublime attributes. And He is the Mighty, the 
Wise. 

Section 8: Wrongdoing of Deniers 

61 And if Allah were to destroy people for their wrongdoing, 
He would not leave on it a single creature, but He gives them res- 
pite till an appointed time. So when their doom comes they cannot 
postpone it an hour, nor (can they) bring it forward. 62 And they 
ascribe to Allah what they (themselves) hate,' and their tongues 
relate the lie that for them is good. Assuredly for them is the Fire, 
and they will be abandoned (in it). 63 By Allah! We certainly sent 
(messengers) to nations before you, but the devil made their deeds 
seem good to them. So he is their patron today, and for them is a 
painful punishment. 64 And We have not revealed to you the Book 
except that you may make clear to them what they differ about, 
and (as) a guidance and a mercy for a people who believed 65 And 



a (59) The allusion is to the barbarous custom of burying daughters alive, 
which was prevalent among the Arabs, especially among their chiefs. Its abolition 
was one of the numerous blessings of Islam. With no physical or administrative 
power behind it to ensure its enforcement, the word of Allah swept away this 
deep-rooted custom as if by a magician's wand, so that not a single case of the 
burial of a living girl ever occurred after the mandate came. Attention is drawn to 
the inconsistency of their avowed beliefs with their inward convictions in v. 62. 

b (62) The reference is to their ascribing daughters to Allah, while they 
themselves did not like to have a daughter, thus showing how obviously inconsis- 
tent with their inward convictions was their professed belief in the Divine Being. 

c (64) The previous verse shows that the whole world was in the grip of the 



16 : 66 • PARABLES SHOWING TRUTH OF REVELATION 329 

Allah sends down water from above, and with it gives life to the 
earth after its death." Surely there is a sign in this for a people who 
listen. 

Section 9: Parables showing Truth of Revelation 

66 And surely there is a lesson for you in the cattle: We give 
you to drink of what is in their bellies — from between the faeces 
and the blood — pure milk, agreeable to the drinkers. 67 And of the 
fruits of the palms and the grapes, you obtain from them intoxi- 
cants and goodly provision. There is surely a sign in this for a 
people who ponder. 

68 And jour Lord revealed to the bee: Make hives in the moun- 
tains and in the trees and in what they build, 69 then eat of all the 
fruits and walk in the ways of jour Lord submissively. From their 

devil at the advent of the Prophet. Messengers were sent to all nations before the 
coming of the Prophet, but as time passed, the followers of the messengers, ins- 
tead of following their teachings, followed evil ways, which gradually appeared to 
them so beautiful that the good of this world was all in all for them. This verse 
shows that the teachings of the previous prophets had been distorted to such an 
extent that a new Prophet was now needed to lead them aright. Truth could not 
now be discovered without light from heaven. It also establishes that the new 
Prophet's message was for the followers of all religions; in other words, for the 
whole world. 

a (65) The water from heaven is the Divine revelation, the death of the earth 
is its corruption, and the giving of life signifies its spiritual awakening, marvellous 
signs of which had already appeared in Arabia. 

b (67) Verses 66 and 67 compare the Divine laws as manifested in nature 
with the handiwork of man. Divine law in nature produces such a valuable and 
agreeable diet as pure milk, separating it from the other elements — blood and 
dung — to which food is reduced in the belly of an animal, which the hand of 
man is unable to do. On the other hand, the most agreeable provisions produced 
by nature in the form of fruits are turned into such a poisonous drug as alcohol by 
the hand of man. The two illustrations thus point out that just as Divine laws 
working in the physical world produce the purest and most agreeable diets, sepa- 
rating them from obnoxious elements and useless excrements, so their working in 
the spiritual world produces the most sublime moral teachings, which afford to 
man the purest spiritual diet. But the best teachings given by Divine revelation are 
likely to be corrupted by the hands of man, as the best of fruits is turned into such 
an obnoxious thing as alcohol.

bellies comes forth a beverage of many colours, in which there is 
healing for man. Surely in this there is a sign for a people who 
reflect." 70 And Allah creates you, then He causes you to die; and 
some of you are brought back to the worst part of life, knowing 
nothing after having knowledge. Surely Allah is Knowing, 
Powerful. 

Section 10: The Recipient of Revelation 

71 And Allah has made some of you excel others in the means 
of subsistence; so those who are made to excel do not give away 
their sustenance to those whom their right hands possess, so that 
they may be equal in it. Will they then deny the favour of Allah? c 



a (69) This is another illustration to show that Divine revelation brings about 
an object which cannot be effected by human exertions. The bee gathers the sweet 
juice of different flowers, making it into honey. What this small creature effects, 
working instinctively in obedience to Divine laws, cannot be effected by the com- 
bined exertions of the whole of humanity. This illustration shows a similar work- 
ing of the Divine laws in the spiritual world, viz., that the Prophet, working, as it 
were, instinctively in obedience to the Divine laws prevailing in the spiritual world, 
collects by Divine revelation all that is best and noblest in any religion, and sums 
it up in the Quran: a work which could not be effected by human exertion. 

It should be noted that five kinds of the wahy (revelation) of Allah are men- 
tioned in the Quran: a revelation to inanimate objects, as the earth (99:5) or the 
heavens (41:12); a revelation to living creatures other than man, as the bee; a 
revelation to the angels (8:12); a revelation to men and women other than prophets, 
as the apostles of Jesus (5:111) or the mother of Moses (28:7); and a revelation to 
prophets and messengers. All these kinds of wahy are not identical; in the case of 
the bee, it is its very instinct that is a revelation to it. The revelation to the prophets 
is the expression of Divine will for the guidance of people. 

b (70) As in individuals, so in nations. Those who had been given knowledge 
of Divine revelation before the Holy Prophet had lost or corrupted it at the time of 
his advent; hence the necessity for a new Divine revelation. 

c (71) This provides an answer to the demand of the disbelievers expressly 
stated elsewhere: "We will not believe till we are given the like of what Allah's 
messengers are given" (6:124). It is pointed out that, as there are differences in the 
physical world, so there are differences in the spiritual world. All persons are not 
equally fit to receive the gift of Divine revelation. The favour of Allah, which is 
the Divine revelation, should not be denied simply because all individuals are not 
equal recipients of it. 



1 6 : 72 • THE RECIPIENT OF REVELATION 331 

72 And Allah has made wives for you from among yourselves," and 
has given you sons and daughters from your wives, and has pro- 
vided you with good things. Will they then believe in falsehood 
and deny the favour of Allah? 

73 And they serve besides Allah that which controls for them 
no sustenance at all from the heavens and the earth; nor have they 
any power. 74 So do not coin likenesses for Allah. Surely Allah 
knows and you do not know. 75 Allah sets forth a parable: There is 
a slave, the property of another, controlling nothing, and there is 
one to whom We have granted from Ourselves a goodly provision, 
so he spends from it (on good works) secretly and openly. Are the 
two alike? Praise be to Allah! But most of them do not know. e 
76 And Allah sets forth a parable of two men: One of them dumb, 
controlling nothing, and he is a burden to his master; wherever he 
sends him, he brings no good. Is he equal with him who enjoins 
justice, and he is on the right path? 



a (72-1) The statement made here is that for all men wives are created from 
their anfus (plural of nafs, meaning soul or self). No one ever interprets these 
words in the erroneous way in which similar words about Adam are misinter- 
preted, where the rib is made to take the place of soul or self. The words of the 
Quran do not allow this unnatural interpretation, which is based upon the story of 
Genesis. 

b (72-2) They believe in the superstition that the idols, which are inanimate 
objects, can intercede with Allah, and deny the favour of Allah (i.e. Divine revela- 
tion) being granted to a human being. Hence the next verse speaks of the idols. 

c (75) By slave is meant the idol-worshipper who, instead of being master of 
idols, stones, and such-like objects, as Allah has created him to be, chooses to 
become a slave to them, bows before them, and considers them more powerful 
than himself. By the master of the goodly provision from Allah is meant the recip- 
ient of the Divine revelation, i.e., the Prophet. The comparison is made to show 
that the idol- worshippers will ultimately find themselves deprived of all power. 

d (76) This parable makes the same comparison as the previous one. The 
purport is here made clearer. The master of the goodly provision from Allah of the 
previous verse is here plainly called the enjoiner of justice and the one who is on 
the right path, while the idol-worshipper is the one who is not able to do anything 
and who remains unsuccessful in whatever he undertakes — a prophetical allu- 
sion to the defeats and discomfiture of the idolaters.

Section 1 1 : Punishment withheld 

77 And Allah's is the unseen of the heavens and the earth. 
And the matter of the Hour is but as a twinkling of the eye or it is 
nearer still. a Surely Allah is Powerful over all things. 78 And Allah 
brought you forth from the wombs of your mothers — you knew 
nothing — and He gave you hearing and sight and hearts that you 
might give thanks. 

79 Do they not see the birds, constrained in the middle of the 
sky? None withholds them but Allah. Surely there are signs in 
this for a people who believe. 80 And Allah has given you an abode 
in your houses, and He has given you houses of the skins of cattle, 
which you find light to carry on the day of your march and on the 
day of your halting, and of their wool and their fur and their hair, 
household stuff and a provision for a time. 81 And Allah has made 
for you, out of what He has created, shelters, and He has given 
you in the mountains, places of retreat, and He has given you 
garments to save you from the heat^ and (protective) garments to 
save you in your fighting. Thus does He complete His favour to 
you that you may submit. 82 Then if they turn away, your duty is 
only to deliver the message clearly. 83 They recognize the favour of 
Allah, yet they deny it, and most of them are ungrateful. 



a (77) By the unseen is meant the knowledge of the unseen, or the knowledge 
of the eventual fulfilment of the prophecies; and by the Hour is meant the hour of 
the doom of the opponents of the Prophet, the hour when their power was to be 
utterly destroyed. 

b (79) Both Arab proverb and Arab poetry bear witness to birds being spoken 
of as attending a victorious army to feed upon the corpses of the enemy left on the 
battlefield. In withholding the birds, therefore, there may be a reference to with- 
holding the punishment which must ultimately overtake the enemy. 

c (81-1) The mention of one of two contrary things always involves the other. 
Hence by the preservation from heat spoken of here, preservation from heat and 
cold alike is meant. 

d (81-2) As He has given you of the good things of this life, the physical 
blessings, He now completes these blessings by giving you the greatest of His 
blessings, i.e., Divine revelation, so that, submitting to it, you may prosper. 



16:84' PROPHETS TESTIFY 333 

Section 12: Prophets testify 

84 And on the day when We raise up a witness out of every 
nation," then permission (to offer excuse) will not be given to the 
disbelievers, nor will they be allowed to make amends. 85 And 
when the wrongdoers see the punishment, it will not be lightened 
for them, nor will they be given respite. 86 And when those who set 
up partners (with Allah) see their associate-gods, they will say: 
Our Lord, these are our associate-gods on whom we called besides 
You. But they will throw back at them the word: Surely you are 
liars. 87 And they will tender submission to Allah on that day, and 
what they used to forge will fail them. 

88 Those who disbelieve and hinder (people) from Allah's way, 
We will add punishment to their punishment because they made 
mischief. 89 And on the day when We raise up in every people a 
witness against them from among themselves, and bring you as a 
witness against these. And We have revealed the Book to you 
explaining all things/ and a guidance and mercy and good news 
for those who submit. 

Section 13: Revelation enjoins Good 

90 Surely Allah commands (the doing of) justice and the 
doing of good (to others) and the giving to the near of kin, and He 
forbids indecency and evil and rebellion. He instructs you that you 
may be mindful.'' 91 And fulfil the covenant of Allah, when you have 



a (84) In this verse, as well as in the concluding verse (v. 89) of this section, 
the broad humanitarian doctrine is taught that a prophet has been raised in every 
nation. There are religions which claim hundreds of prophets for a single nation, 
like the house of Israel, but grudge even a single true prophet to other vast coun- 
tries and nations. Islam rejects all such narrow views of the spiritual providence of 
Allah, Who is not the "Lord God of Israel", but the Lord of all nations. 

b (89-1) By these are meant the Muslim community throughout the world 
and in all ages. 

c (89-2) By everything is meant every basic principle necessary for the spiri- 
tual welfare of man. The sunnah, the practice of the Prophet, as illustrating the 
precepts of the Quran, supplies the details. 

d (90) This verse deals with the different degrees of goodness and evil. The

made a covenant, and do not break (your) oaths after making them 
firm, and you have indeed made Allah your surety. Surely Allah 
knows what you do. 

92 And do not be like her who unravels her yarn, disinteg- 
rating it into pieces, after she has spun it strongly." You make your 
oaths to be means of deceit between you because (one) nation is 
more numerous than (another) nation. Allah only tries you by 
this. And He will certainly make clear to you on the day of 
Resurrection what you differed about. 93 And if Allah please, He 
would make you a single nation, but He leaves in error whom He 
pleases and guides whom He pleases. And certainly you will be 
questioned as to what you did. 94 And do not make your oaths a 
means of deceit between you, so that a foot should slip after its 
stability, and you should taste evil because you hinder (people) 
from Allah's way and severe punishment be your (lot). 95 And do 
not take a small price for Allah's covenant. Surely what is with 
Allah is better for you, if only you knew! 96 What is with you 
passes away and what is with Allah is enduring. And We shall 

lowest form of goodness is justice or returning good for good, and includes not 
only justice proper but also the fulfilment of all duties and obligations. A higher 
degree of goodness is, however, that which is called ihsan, or goodness proper, the 
doing of good without having received any benefit. The last stage of goodness is 
that in which a person's nature is so inclined to good that he does good to all people 
as an ordinary man does good to his own near of kin. In fact, he looks upon the 
whole of humanity as his kindred. 

Similarly, this verse deals with the three degrees of evil: the merest indecency 
which may not affect the rights of others, evil actions which affect the rights of 
other individuals, and oppression or rebellion affecting the rights of large numbers, 
nations or states. 

a (92-1) People, after accepting the truth, are united by certain ties, but when 
this union brings about strength, they destroy it with their own hands. It was unity 
which made the Muslims rise to great power, but that unity today lies in ruins, and 
the strong community of Islam is like the unravelled yarn of a crazy spinner. 

b (92-2) Faithfulness to covenants is here stressed and, from the covenant 
with God, the subject is diverted to covenants between people. Attention is drawn 
in the words, you make your oaths to be means of deceit between you, to the 
conditions generally prevailing in the world, to the breach of covenants between 
nations, which is ruining the stability of human society. 



16:97" THE QURAN IS NOT A FORGERY 335 

certainly give to those who are patient their reward for the best of 
what they did. 97 Whoever does good, whether male or female, " 
and is a believer, We shall certainly make him live a good life, 
and We shall certainly give them their reward for the best of what 
they did. 

98 So when you recite the Quran, seek refuge in Allah from 
the accursed devil. "Surely he has no authority over those who 
believe and rely on their Lord. 100 His authority is only over those 
who befriend him and those who set up partners with Him. 

Section 14: The Quran is not a Forgery 

101 And when We change a message for a message — and 
Allah knows best what He reveals — they say: 7ou are only a 
forger. Rather, most of them do not know. 102 Say: The Holy 
Spirit has revealed it from jour Lord with truth, c that it may estab- 
lish those who believe, and as a guidance and good news for those 
who submit. 103 And indeed We know that they say: Only a mortal 
teaches him. The tongue of him whom they hint at is foreign, and 
this is clear Arabic language. 104 Those who do not believe in 



a (97) The doers of good, both men and women, are made to lead a good life 
in this world and will have a reward in the Hereafter. 

b (101) It is not the change of the Quranic verses that is spoken of here; it is 
the change of the previous messages sent through former prophets for the message 
of the Holy Quran. This chapter belongs to Makkah, and the upholders of abro- 
gation have never asserted that any verse was abrogated while the Holy Prophet 
was at Makkah. Moreover, it was the revelation of the Quran itself that was called 
a forgery, and not an occasional change that any of its commandments could have 
undergone, with which change the disbelievers had, in fact, no concern. See also 
2:106 footnote. 

c (102) The Holy Spirit (Ruh al-qudus) is here stated to be the bearer of the 
revelation to the Holy Prophet; elsewhere the same bearer is called al-Ruh al- 
Arriin, or the Faithful Spirit (26: 193), and the same is called Gabriel in 2:97. 

d (103) Various names have been suggested as to the person whom the 
opponents of the Prophet referred to. These are mostly the names of Christian 
slaves, who were not Arabs. All these slaves were among the early converts to 
Islam, who were most cruelly persecuted by the Quraish, yet they remained firm 
under the severest tortures. Is it possible that they, without being in the least

Allah's messages, Allah does not guide them, and for them is a 
painful punishment. 105 Only they forge lies who do not believe in 
Allah's messages, and they are the liars." 

106 Whoever disbelieves in Allah after his belief — not he 
who is compelled while his heart is content with faith, but he who 
opens (his) breast for disbelief — they incur Allah's displeasure, 
and for them is a grievous punishment. 107 That is because they 
love this world's life more than the Hereafter, and because Allah 
does not guide the disbelieving people. 108 These are they whose 
hearts and ears and eyes Allah has sealed and these are the heed- 
less ones. c 109 No doubt that in the Hereafter they are the losers. 
110 Then surely your Lord, to those who flee after they are persecu- 
ted, then struggle hard and are patient, surely jour Lord after that 
is Protecting, Merciful. 

Section 15: Fate of the Opponents 

111 On the day when every soul will come pleading for itself, 

gainers, should have thus willingly suffered persecutions for a cause which they 
knew to be false? This is sufficient to show the absurdity of the allegation, and it 
is to this that v. 105 refers. They certainly cannot be supposed to have been the 
authors of the sublime themes of the Holy Quran. 

a (105) The reference is to v. 103. The allegation was that certain slaves 
taught the Prophet. How could a forger of lies be a believer, especially when he 
had to undergo the severest trials for its sake. 

b (106) Only very rare instances are met with in the early history of Islam in 
which converts even under compulsion ever recanted. 

c (108) Allah does not seal the hearts of people and thus hinder them from 
accepting the truth; it is they who reject the truth, turning a deaf ear to the preach- 
ing of the Prophet, as the previous verses show. Nor are the hearts sealed forever, 
for, as v. 110 shows, even after that Allah forgives them, if they repent and show 
perseverance. 

rf(110) The struggle (jihad) spoken of here is certainly not in connection 
with fighting, for the verse was revealed at Makkah. Note also that God is spoken 
of here as being Ghaffir, translated as Protecting, to those who flee from their 
homes on account of persecution and then struggle hard to establish Truth. God 
being Ghafiir here is in relation to His exalting them by protecting them from the 
commission of sins, not forgiving of sins, for it is their acts of sacrifice that are 
spoken of here, not their sins. 



16:112' FATE OF THE OPPONENTS 337 

and every soul will be paid in full what it has done, and they will 
not be dealt with unjustly. 112 And Allah sets forth a parable: A town 
safe and secure, to which its means of subsistence came in abun- 
dance from every quarter; but it disbelieved in Allah's favours, so 
Allah made it taste a pall of hunger and fear because of what they 
did." 113 And certainly a Messenger came to them from among 
them, but they rejected him, so the punishment caught them while 
they were wrongdoers. 

114 So eat of what Allah has given you, lawful and good 
(things), and give thanks for Allah's favour, if He it is you serve. 
n5 He has forbidden you only what dies of itself and blood and the 
flesh of swine and that on which any other name than that of Allah 
has been invoked; but whoever is driven to (it), not desiring nor 
exceeding the limit, then surely Allah is Forgiving, Merciful.* 
116 And do not utter the lie which your tongues describe: This is 
lawful and this unlawful; so that you forge a lie against Allah. 
Surely those who forge a lie against Allah will not prosper. 117 A 
little enjoyment — and for them is a painful punishment. 118 And 
to those who are Jews We prohibited what We have related to you 
already, and We did not wrong them, but they wronged them- 
selves. 119 And surely jour Lord, for those who do evil in igno- 
rance, then turn after that and make amends, surely jour Lord 
after that is Forgiving, Merciful. 



a (112) The parable is set forth to depict the state of Makkah as it was before 
the time of the Holy Prophet and, prophetically, its fate after he was rejected, after 
it disbelieved in Allah 's favours. Its first condition was one of great prosperity and 
affluence, as referred to in 106:3 — 4. When the Prophet and his followers were 
persecuted and tortured, a famine overtook them, which destroyed everything, till 
they ate skins and dead animals. This was the pall of hunger, spoken of here. But, 
even then, they did not stop persecution and tried to exterminate Islam by the 
sword. The result was that all their attacks on Madinah failed, and ultimately 
Makkah itself lay powerless when attacked by the Prophet. This was the pall of 
fear, being so called because no blood was shed.

338 16. THE BEE • 16 : 120 

Section 16: The Way to Greatness 

120 Surely Abraham was a model (of virtue), obedient to Allah, 
upright, and he was not from among the idolaters, 121 grateful for 
His favours. He chose him and guided him on the right path. 
122 And We gave him good in this world; and in the Hereafter he is 
surely among the righteous. 

123 Then We revealed to you: Follow the faith of Abraham, 
the upright one; and he was not from among the idolaters. 124 The 
Sabbath was ordained only against those who differed about it." 
And surely your Lord will judge between them on the day of 
Resurrection in that in which they differed. 

125 Call to the way of your Lord with wisdom and goodly 
exhortation, and argue with them in the best manner. Surely your 
Lord knows best him who strays from His path, and He knows 
best those who go aright. 126 And if you take your turn, then 
retaliate with the like of what you were afflicted with. c But if you 
show patience, it is certainly best for the patient. 127 And be patient 
and your patience is not but by (the help of) Allah, and do not 
grieve for them, nor be in distress by what they plan. 128 Surely 
Allah is with those who keep their duty and those who do good (to 
others). 



a (124) The meaning here seems to be that the Sabbath, the Jewish day of 
worship which should have made them walk in the footsteps of righteous Abraham, 
was turned against them because of their violation of it. Or, the statement is made 
to show that it was not necessary for the Muslims to observe a day of worship, as 
even Abraham, a model of virtue for both the Jews and the Muslims, did not 
observe a particular day of worship. 

b (125) The principle laid down for preaching and religious controversy by 
the Quran has yet to be learned by the most advanced people. It shows the breadth 
of mind of the Holy Prophet, more especially when it is remembered that the 
injunction was given at a time when Muslims were being most severely perse- 
cuted and there was the greatest reason for adopting a harsh attitude. 

c (126) Muslims were being persecuted most cruelly, and they were told that 
the time would come when they would dominate their erstwhile persecutors. In 
that case they are allowed to punish them for their guilt, but it is twice added, here 
and in v. 127, that they should show patience when they had the upper hand and 
do good even to their enemies, for Allah is with those who do good (v. 128). 



Chapter 17 
Bamisra'ii The Israelites 

This chapter opens and ends by referring to the history of the Israelites, who, 
after attaining to greatness, were twice punished for their misdeeds. It begins 
with a mention of the Mi 'raj or ascension of the Holy Prophet, indicative of 
the eminence to which the Muslims would rise. It then warns Muslims of the 
fate which befell the Israelites, as the same fate was to befall them. Then it goes 
on to deal with the following subjects: every deed must have a consequence, 
the moral teachings Muslims must follow to do good deeds, opposition to the 
truth and to the righteous, and its defeat by the truth — that "truth" being the 
Holy Prophet himself who is the "spirit of truth" prophesied in the Gospel of 
John — the Quran being a miracle, and, finally, Moses' warning to Pharaoh, 
a warning like it now being given by the Quran to its opponents. This chapter 
was revealed in the early period at Makkah, around the fifth year of the Holy 
Prophet's mission. 



Section 1 : Israelites punished Twice 

In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful. 



£ 1 Glory be to Him Who carried His servant by night from the

a (1) The carrying by night of the Holy Prophet Muhammad from the Sacred 
Mosque at Makkah to the Remote Mosque at Jerusalem (known as Isrd ') is in 
reference to the Prophet's reported Ascension (known as Mi 'raj). Isrd' was the 
first stage in Mi 'raj, as before his Ascension to heaven, the Prophet was taken to 
the Remote Mosque, or the Temple at Jerusalem. The Ascension was not a trans- 
lation of the body, but the spiritual experience of the Holy Prophet, as is shown in 
v. 60 where it is expressly called a vision. As the significance of the Ascension 
was the spiritual eminence of the Holy Prophet and indicated his triumph in the 
world, his being carried to the Temple at Jerusalem signified that he would also 
inherit the blessings of the Israelite prophets.

Children of Israel (saying): Take no guardian beside Me a — 
3 (you) the offspring of those whom We bore with Noah. Surely he 
was a grateful servant. 4 And We made known to the Children of 
Israel in the Book: Certainly you will make mischief in the land 
twice, and behave insolently with mighty arrogance. ' 5 So when 
the first warning of the two came to pass, We raised against you 
Our servants, of mighty prowess, so they made havoc in (your) 
houses. And it was an accomplished threat. 'Then We gave you 
back the turn against them, and aided you with wealth and chil- 
dren and made you a numerous band. c 7 If you do good, you do 
good for your own souls. And if you do evil, it is for them. So 
when the second warning came, (We raised another people) that 
they might bring you to grief and that they might enter the Mosque 
as they entered it the first time, and that they might destroy, what- 
ever they conquered, with utter destruction/ 8 It may be that your 
Lord will have mercy on you. And if you return (to mischief), We 



a (2) The first verse really prophesies a great future for Islam and the 
Muslims, while this warns them of the pitfalls of greatness, citing the instance of a 
nation that had been made to rise to eminence before them. 

b (4) Jerusalem was destroyed twice as a punishment for the transgressions 
of the Jews, once by the Babylonians, and again by the Romans. See Jesus' 
warning in Matthew 23:38 and Luke 21:24 and various other like references. The 
Psalms are also replete with warnings. 

c (6) V. 5 relates the destruction of the Temple at Jerusalem and the murder, 
imprisonment, and banishment of the Jews by the Babylonians in the year 588 B.C., 
while v. 6 relates to the return of the Jews and rebuilding of the temple under 
Zerubbabel, and to their subsequent prosperity. 

d (7) This verse describes the destruction of the Temple a second time, 
which was accomplished by the Romans under Titus. There is a prophetical 
reference here to the history of the Muslims. The Caliphate of Islam was des- 
troyed twice, first by the Mongols under Hulagu in 656 A.H. (1258 C.E.), and 
again by the powers of Europe after the First World War. But while in the case of 
the Israelites their spiritual centre was laid waste on both occasions, the spiritual 
centre of Islam, the Ka'bah, has remained intact on both occasions under a Divine 
promise. Following the first great reverse in Muslim history in 1258, Islam gained 
spiritual conquests in the coming over to Islam en masse of the Mongols and 
Turks. After the second reverse, the afflictions of Islam are giving birth to a spiri- 
tual resuscitation of the world. On both occasions, there has been a revival of its 
temporal power as well. 



17:9" EVERY DEED HAS A CONSEQUENCE 341 

will return (to punishment)." And We have made hell a prison for 
the disbelievers. 

9 Surely this Quran guides to what is most upright, and gives 
good news to the believers who do good that theirs is a great 
reward, 10 and that those who do not believe in the Hereafter, We 
have prepared for them a painful punishment. 

Section 2: Every Deed has a Consequence 

11 And man prays for evil as he ought to pray for good; and 
man is ever hasty. 12 And We made the night and the day two 
signs, then We have made the sign of the night to pass away and 
We have made the sign of the day manifest, so that you may seek 
grace from your Lord, and that you may know the numbering of 
years and the reckoning. And We have explained everything 
distinctly. 13 And We have made every human being's actions to 
cling to his neck, and We shall bring forth to him on the day 
of Resurrection a book which he will find wide open.^ 14 Read 
your book. Your own soul is sufficient as a reckoner against you 
this day. 15 Whoever goes aright, goes aright only for the good of 
his own soul; and whoever goes astray, goes astray only to 
its detriment. And no bearer of a burden can bear the burden 



a (8) This relates to the advent of the Holy Prophet Muhammad, when the 
Israelites were again given a chance to reform, but they are told that if they return 
to mischief they will again be punished. 

b (12) The night stands for the darkness of ignorance and unbelief (see 
2:257), and the passing away of the night indicates that ignorance will vanish and 
the light of Islam will take its place. Arabia witnessed this sign in the seventh cen- 
tury C.E., and Islam has since then been gradually advancing in the world. 

c (13) This verse reveals the principle that every action produces an effect 
which is made to cling to a person, and that this very effect will be met with on 
the day of Resurrection in the form of a wide open book. It is thus by leaving its 
effect behind that every action is recorded, and this very effect constitutes the 
book of a person's actions. Clinging to the neck indicates the inseparability of one 
thing from another, thus establishing the law of cause and effect. 

d (14) This verse throws a flood of light on the nature of the reckoning on 
the day of Resurrection, showing clearly that it is nothing but a complete manifes- 
tation of the effects of the deeds done in this life. 



342 17. THE ISRAELITES • 17 : 16 

of another." Nor do We punish until We raise a messenger. 

16 And when We wish to destroy a town, We send command- 
ments to its people who lead easy lives, but they transgress therein; 
thus the word proves true against it, so We destroy it with utter 
destruction/ 17 And how many generations did We destroy after 
Noah! And your Lord is sufficient as being Aware and Seer of His 
servants' sins. 18 Whoever desires this transitory life, We hasten to 
him in it what We please for whomsoever We desire, then We 
assign to him hell; he will enter it despised, driven away. 19 And 
whoever desires the Hereafter and strives for it with due striving 
and is a believer — those are they whose striving is amply 
rewarded. 20 A11 do We aid — these as well as those — out of the 
bounty of your Lord, and the bounty of your Lord is not limited. 

21 See how We have made some of them to excel others. And 
certainly the Hereafter is greater in degrees and greater in excellence. 
22 Do not set up any other god with Allah, or you will sit down 
despised, forsaken. 

Section 3: Moral Precepts 

23 And your Lord has decreed that you serve none but Him, 
and do good to parents. If either or both of them reach old age 



a (15-1) This verse strikes at the root of the doctrine of atonement. The burden 
of the sins of one person cannot be taken away by another, for, as already stated, 
the effect of each man's actions clings to himself. 

b (15-2) Here it is stated that guidance is offered to man through a messen- 
ger of God, but if he still persists in error and strays from the path, it is to his own 
detriment. And then it is added that the punishment of the Hereafter is only after 
man has been warned through a Divine messenger. The law as to punishment in 
this world is stated in v. 16, which speaks of the destruction of towns, for such 
punishment is sent when tyranny and transgression assume extraordinary propor- 
tions, and punishment is then inflicted on large numbers. 

c (16) Allah does not command people to transgress. The meaning is clear: 
Allah sends them commandments to do good, pointing out the right way through 
His prophets, but as they are accustomed to lead easy lives, they transgress those 
commandments, and are therefore punished. 

d (23) Doing good to parents is placed next to submission to Allah, for 
among fellow-beings none has a greater claim upon a person than his parents. 



17 : 24 • MORAL PRECEPTS 343 

with you, say no word to them showing annoyance, nor rebuke 
them, and speak to them a generous word. 24 And make yourself 
gentle to them with humility out of mercy, and say: My Lord, have 
mercy on them, as they brought me up (when I was) little. 

25 Your Lord knows best what is in your minds. If you are 
righteous, He is surely Forgiving to those who turn (to Him). 
26 And give to the near of kin his due and (to) the needy and the 
traveller, and do not squander wastefully. 27 Surely the squanderers 
are the devil's brethren. And the devil is ever ungrateful to his Lord." 
28 And if you (have to) turn away from them (in order) to seek 
mercy from jour Lord that you hope for, then speak to them a 
gentle word.* 29 And do not make your hand to be chained to your 
neck, nor stretch it forth to its fullest extension, so that you sit down 
blamed, stripped off. c 30 Surely your Lord amplifies provision for 
whom He pleases, and restricts (it also). Surely He is ever Aware, 
Seer, of His servants. 

Section 4: Moral Precepts 

31 And do not kill your children for fear of poverty — We 
provide for them and for you. Surely the killing of them is a great 
wrong. 32 And do not go near to fornication: surely it is an 



a (27) While enjoining charity, the Quran also draws attention to economy, 
thus indicating the golden mean. Those who waste wealth are called the devil's 
brethren, because they are ungrateful to God for wasting away what He has given 
them out of His grace. 

b (28) Hoping for mercy from the Lord means standing in need of the bounty 
of the Lord, i.e., not having anything to give to the needy. In that case one should 
still speak to the needy gently. A saying of the Holy Prophet declares a gentle word 
spoken to someone to be a deed of charity (Bukhari, 56:72). 

c (29) By the hand being tied to the neck is meant being miserly, and by 
stretching it forth to its fullest extension is meant being wasteful. The verse teaches 
that the middle path should be adopted in one's ordinary expenses. 

rf(31) Infanticide, in the case of daughters, was met with among the Arabs, 
but this was not for fear of poverty. Since the word children (aulad) includes both 
males and females, the killing of children here may mean not giving them proper 
education; ignorance, or intellectual death, being treated as death. (Editor 's Note: 
Abortion without a medical reason may also be included here.)

obscenity. And evil is the way." 33 And do not kill the soul which 
Allah has forbidden except for a just cause. And whoever is killed 
unjustly, We have indeed given to his heir authority — but let him 
not exceed the limit in killing. Surely he will be helped. 

34 And do not draw near to the orphan's property, except in 
the best way, till he attains his maturity. And fulfil the promise; 
surely the promise will be enquired into. 35 And give full measure 
when you measure out, and weigh with a true balance. This is fair 
and better in the end. 36 And do not follow that of which you have 
no knowledge/ Surely the hearing and the sight and the heart, all 
of these will be asked about it. 37 And do not go about in the land 
exultingly, for you cannot split the earth, nor reach the mountains 
in height. 38 A11 this, the evil of it, is hateful in the sight of your 
Lord. 

39 This is from the wisdom which your Lord has revealed to 
you. And do not set up with Allah any other god, or you would be 
thrown into hell, blamed, cast away. 40 Has then your Lord pre- 
ferred to give you sons, and (for Himself) taken daughters from 
among the angels? Surely you utter a terrible saying. 

Section 5: Disbelievers grow Harder 

41 And certainly We have repeated (warnings) in this Quran 
that they may be mindful. And it only adds to their aversion. 



a (32) The Quran not only forbids all out-of-wedlock sex, but enjoins people 
not to go near it, thus avoiding all those opportunities which are likely to tempt 
one to fall into the evil. Hence it is that Islam discourages the too free inter- 
mingling of the sexes. 

b (33) The words he will be helped indicate that as the state is bound to help 
him by bringing the murderer within reach of the law, the heir should not take the 
law into his own hands. This is called exceeding the limits. 

c (36) If this injunction were followed, all society gossip would immediately 
cease, relieving many innocent people of the heart-burning which they suffer on 
account of evil and unfounded reports. The verse also forbids entering into dis- 
cussions without accurate knowledge, or putting forward uncertain opinion. 

rf(41) Allah's purpose in repeating arguments and signs in the Quran is to 
make people mindful, but the more they are reminded, the greater is their aversion 
to it. 



17:42' DISBELIEVERS GROW HARDER 345 

42 Say: If there were with Him gods, as they say, then certainly 
they would have been able to seek a way to the Lord of the Throne." 
43 Glory be to Him, and He is supremely exalted above what they 
say! 44 The seven heavens and the earth and those in them declare 
His glory. And there is not a single thing but glorifies Him with 
His praise, but you do not understand their glorification. Surely He 
is Forbearing, Forgiving. 

45 And when you recite the Quran, We place between you and 
those who do not believe in the Hereafter a hidden barrier; c 46 and 
We put coverings on their hearts and a deafness in their ears that 
they may not understand it; and when you mention your Lord alone 
in the Quran, they turn their backs in aversion. 47 We know best 
what they listen to when they listen to you, and when they take 
counsel secretly, when the wrongdoers say: You follow only a man 
deprived of reason. 48 See, what they liken you to! So they have 
gone astray, and cannot find the way. 

49 And they say: When we are bones and decayed particles, 
shall we then be raised up as a new creation? s0 Say: Be stones or 
iron, 51 or some other creature of those which are too hard (to 



a (42) The idol-worshippers were sunk deep in vices and immorality, while 
access to the Divine Being — a way to the Lord of the Throne — which they 
claimed they got through their idols, should have purified their lives. Or, the 
meaning is that, if they had access to God, Who holds all power in His hands, 
they should have received Divine help and been successful in uprooting Islam. 

b (44) The whole universe is here mentioned as declaring the glory of Allah, 
which means declaring God to be free from every imperfection and impurity, or 
from everything derogatory to His dignity. This declaration need not be with the 
tongue and in words: in fact, the very dependence of the whole creation on the 
Creator and its consequent imperfection is a glorification of the Creator. 

c (45) This hidden barrier is nothing but that erected by their own aversion, as 
plainly indicated in v. 41. 

d (46) The placing of coverings on the hearts and deafness in the ears of the 
disbelievers is no doubt attributed to Allah as the prime cause of all things, but 
this covering and deafness is directly brought about because they do not even listen 
to the mention of Allah, and flee in aversion from His word. Allah brings it about 
on account of the condition of their very hearts and ears. See also 7:179.

receive life) in your minds \ a But they will say: Who will return 
us? Say: He Who created you at first. Still they will shake their 
heads at you and say: When will it be? Say: Maybe it has drawn 
near. 52 0n the day when He will call you forth, then will you 
obey Him, giving Him praise, and you will think that you remain- 
ed only a little (while). 

Section 6: Punishment must follow 

53 And say to My servants that they speak what is best. 
Surely the devil sows dissensions among them. The devil is surely 
an open enemy to man. c 54 Your Lord knows you best. He will have 
mercy on you, if He please, or He will punish you, if He please. 
And We have not sent you as being in charge of them. 55 And your 
Lord best knows those who are in the heavens and the earth. And 
certainly We made some of the prophets to excel others, and to 
David We gave the Zabur. e 



a (51-1) They are told that a life after death must follow even if they could 
change themselves into stones. And the spiritual life with which they were quick- 
ened by the Holy Prophet, despite their hard-heartedness — "they were like rocks, 
rather worse in hardness" (2:74) — was a clear proof of this. 

b (51-2) The answer, maybe it has drawn near, refers to the spiritual resusci- 
tation of Arabia, which was now to be accomplished through the Holy Prophet, as 
an indication of the greater Resurrection. The next verse makes it clear: Then will 
you obey Him, giving Him praise. Fifteen years after this the whole of Arabia re- 
sounded with Divine praises. 

c (53) The Muslims — My servants — are here enjoined to be very kind 
when they speak to the disbelievers. It is related that when the Muslims com- 
plained to the Holy Prophet that they were abused by the idolaters, they were told 
to be kind and not to retaliate. It was the devil that was causing these quarrels. 
The words evidently imply that these dissensions were only transient, and that the 
two parties would again become united. 

d (54) In this verse, as elsewhere in the Quran, mercy is mentioned first, thus 
showing that Divine mercy has precedence over Divine retribution. 

e (55) By saying that some of the prophets are made to excel others, the 
excellence of the Holy Prophet over others is implied. David is specially men- 
tioned, because, as stated in the Psalms (called here Zabur), he prayed for the utter 
destruction of his enemies, whereas the two previous verses show that the Holy 
Prophet was enjoined to deal mercifully with his opponents. 



17 : 56 • PUNISHMENT MUST FOLLOW 347 

56 Say: Call on those whom you assert besides Him; they have 
no power to remove distress from you nor to change. 57 Those whom 
they call upon, themselves seek the means of access to their Lord 
— whoever of them is nearest — and they hope for His mercy and 
fear His punishment. Surely the punishment of your Lord is a 
thing to be cautious of." 58 And there is not a town but We will 
destroy it before the day of Resurrection or punish it with a severe 
punishment. That is written in the Book. 59 And nothing hindered 
Us from sending signs, but the ancients rejected them. c And We 
gave to Thamud the she-camel, a manifest sign, but they did her 
wrong, and We send signs only to warn. 

60 And when We said to you: Surely jour Lord encompasses 
people. And We made the vision which We showed you only a 



a (57) These divinities, it is argued, themselves hoped for Divine mercy and 
feared His retribution; the nearer a person to the Divine Being, the greater was his 
hope of mercy and his fear of punishment if he disobeyed. 

b (58) There is a prophetical reference here to great disasters which would 
ruin populous towns. The words "before the day of Resurrection" clearly show that 
the destruction of the towns does not refer to the end of things. Already we have 
seen the fulfilment of this prophecy in the destruction of populous towns in almost 
every country of the world on an unprecedented scale, but it is nothing compared 
with the havoc which the atomic bomb and other inventions of this modern age 
are likely to work, if the mad struggle for power is not ended. It should be noted 
that the prophecy of the ruination of populous towns is here mentioned as a part 
of the Divine scheme in the ultimate triumph of Islam with which this chapter 
deals, and hence the reference to the sending of signs in v. 59. 

c (59) After speaking of a great sign in the latter days, the destruction of 
towns on a large scale, this verse speaks of a general law that God has always been 
sending signs to establish truth, and that nothing ever hindered Him from sending 
signs, though such signs were rejected by the people to whom they were sent. It is 
further made clear that signs are sent to warn people of the evil consequences of 
doing evil. 

rf(60-l) The reference here is to the vision of Ascension or the Mi 'raj 
(Bukhari, 63:42), which was really a prophecy of the ultimate triumph of Islam. In 
a Hadith report the words describing the condition in which the Holy Prophet was 
at the time of this Ascension are: whilst I was in a state between that of one sleep- 
ing and one awake (Bukhari, 59:6). Thus it was not an Ascension of the body. 
Although he was not asleep he was in a vision. He was actually carried to the 
Holy Presence, and he was shown great wonders, but it was in spirit that he was

trial for people, as also the tree cursed in the Quran." And We 
warn them, but it only adds to their great inordinacy. 

Section 7: The Devil's Opposition to the Righteous 

61 And when We said to the angels: Be submissive to Adam, 
they submitted, but not IblTs. He said: Shall I submit to him 
whom You have created of dust? 62 He said: Do You see, this is he 
whom You have honoured above me! If You grant me respite to 
the day of Resurrection, I will certainly cause his progeny to perish 
except a few. 63 He said: Go away! Whoever of them follows you 
surely hell is your recompense, a full recompense. 64 And incite 
whoever of them you can with jour voice, c and collect against them 
your horse(-men) and your foot(-soldiers), and share with them in 
wealth and children, 6 and promise them. And the devil promises 
them only to deceive. 65 My servants — you have surely no authority 



carried, and it was with the spiritual eye that he saw those wonders, not in body 
and with the physical eye, for things spiritual can only be seen with the spiritual 
eye. This vision had an important significance. He saw it at a time when his con- 
dition was one of utmost helplessness, and he was shown that a great future lay 
before him. His opponents, as usual, disbelieved in such visions, and laughed at 
him. 

a (60-2) As the Holy Prophet's vision signified his future triumph and gave 
an indication of the greatness to which Islam would rise, the statement made else- 
where that the tree oizaqqiim was the food of sinners (44:43-44) contained a pro- 
phecy of the discomfiture of the enemies of Islam, telling them that a deadly food 
was in store for them. The reason why the vision and the statement about the cursed 
tree are conjoined is that the triumph of Islam and the discomfiture of the enemy 
went hand in hand. 

b (61) See 2:34 and 7:12. 

c (64-1) The devil is here compared with a coward who comes with great 
show but little real force, and who, if shown the least resistance, retreats at every 
step. Every inviter who invites people to the disobedience of Allah is such a devil. 

d (64-2) The forces of the devil are no other than the evildoers, those going 
quickly into evil being likened to horsemen and those who walk slowly in their 
evil course being likened to infantry. 

e (64-3) The sharing of the devil in wealth signifies everything spent or 
acquired unlawfully and sharing in children is in reference to committing forni- 
cation. 



17:66' OPPOSITION TO THE PROPHET 349 

over them." And your Lord is sufficient as having charge of 
affairs. 

66 Your Lord is He Who speeds the ships for you in the sea 
that you may seek of His grace. Surely He is ever Merciful to you. 
67 And when distress afflicts you in the sea, away go those whom 
you call on except He; but when He brings you safe to the land, 
you turn away. And man is ever ungrateful.* 68 Do you then feel 
secure that He will not bring you low on a tract of land, or send on 
you a violent wind? c Then you will not find a protector for your- 
selves; 69 or, do you feel secure that He will not take you back into 
it another time, then send on you a fierce gale and thus overwhelm 
you for your ungratefulness? Then you will not find any aider 
against Us in the matter. 70 And surely We have honoured the 
children of Adam, and We carry them in the land and the sea, and 
We provide them with good things, and We have made them to 
excel highly most of those whom We have created. 

Section 8: Opposition to the Prophet 

71 On the day when We shall call every people with their 
leader: then whoever is given his book in his right hand, these 
will read their book; and they will not be dealt with unjustly in the 
least. 6 72 And whoever is blind in this (world) he will be blind 



a (65) My servants may include all human beings. The devil will say to the 
sinners: I had no authority over you (14:22). 

b (67) A true picture is drawn here of human nature, which turns to Allah in 
affliction but forgets Him in ease. 

c (68) It was by a violent wind that the combined forces of all the enemies of 
Islam were brought low in the battle of the Allies, when, besieging Madinah in the 
year 5 A.H., they had to flee in disorder. 

d (71-1) The meaning is that the righteous will follow the righteous leaders 
and the wicked will follow their wicked leaders. The word imam, or leader, here is 
interpreted in several other ways, meaning scripture, prophet, law, book of deeds. 
The last of these significances also suits the context, as the books of deeds are 
spoken of in the words that follow. 

e (71-2) This book is the one mentioned in v. 14, i.e., the effect of one's 
deeds, which will be brought before everyone in a palpable form on the day 



350 17. THE ISRAELITES • 17 : 73 



in the Hereafter, and further away from the path." 

73 And surely they had purposed to turn you away from what 
We have revealed to you, that you should forge against Us (some 
revelation) other than that, and then they would have taken you for 
a friend. 74 And if We had not made you firm, you might have 
indeed inclined to them a little; 75 then We would have made you 
taste a double (punishment) in life and a double (punishment) after 
death, and then you would not have found any helper against Us. 
76 And surely they purposed to unsettle you from the land that they 
might expel you from it, and then they will not remain after you 
but a little while. c 77 (This is Our) way with Our messengers 
whom We sent before you, and you will not find a change in Our 
course. 



Section 9: Truth will prevail 

78 Keep up prayer from the declining of the sun till the 
darkness of the night, and the recital of the Quran at dawn. Surely 



of Resurrection. The book of deeds is given in the right hand to those who hold 
the Book of God in their right hands here, i.e., act upon it. As against them are 
those spoken of in the next verse; they remain blind to the Book of God, so they 
will be blind in the Hereafter. 

a (72) Those who remain blind to truth in this life remain blind in the life 
after death, which shows that it is here that a hellish life begins with spiritual 
blindness, and that the hell of the next life is also a blindness. This is corroborated 
by what is said in 57:12, that the faithful will have a light on that day. 

b (73) This refers to an incident at Makkah when the chief men of the 
Quraish offered to give the Prophet wealth or to make him their king, if he gave 
up speaking against their idols and their evil ways. The Prophet's reply was that 
he wanted neither of these things, but that it was for their welfare that he asked 
them to give up evil ways. 

c (76) When the opponents failed to make the Prophet swerve from the path 
of Truth, they planned to expel him from the land, though they were told before- 
hand that in that case they themselves would not retain power but for a short time. 
It was only eight years after the Hijrah that the Prophet entered Makkah as a 
conqueror. 

rf(77) This law is also stated in 14:13-14. 



1 7 : 79 • TRUTH WILL PREVAIL 351 

the recital of the Quran at dawn is witnessed." 79 And during a part 
of the night, keep awake by it, beyond what is incumbent on you; 
maybe jour Lord will raise you to a position of great glory. e 
80 And say: My Lord, make me enter a truthful entering, and make 
me go forth a truthful exit, and grant me from Your presence an 
authority to help (me). 81 And say: The Truth has come and false- 
hood vanished. Surely falsehood is ever bound to vanish. 2 



a (78) After describing how the opponents wanted to bring the Prophet's 
mission to failure by various means, the Prophet is told to resort to prayer as a 
solution of the great difficulties he faced. From the declining of the sun to sunset 
are zuhr and 'asr, or the early and late afternoon prayers, while from sunset till 
darkness are maghrib and 'isha ', or the sunset prayer and the prayer at nightfall. 
The fifth is the morning prayer, which is called here Qur 'an al-fajr, or the recital 
of the Quran at dawn. Thus this verse, which is one of the very early revelations, 
mentions all the five prayers. 

b (79-1) This refers to the tahajjud prayer, whose name is derived from the 
words "keep awake" (fa-tahajjad). The time for this prayer is the latter portion of 
the night in the early hours. It is not an obligatory prayer but, as stated here, it is 
the means of raising a man to a position of great glory. The time at which it is said 
is most suited for the concentration of mind and for communion with God. 

c (79-2) The man whom the opponents had planned to expel from their city 
as a helpless man was to be raised to a position of eminent dignity through prayer 
to God, the tahajjud prayer in the night in particular. As time passes on, the 
Prophet is ever rising to positions of greater and greater glory. But while the verse 
speaks in particular of the Prophet and of the great glory to which he was destined 
to rise, it gives a promise in general as well that whoever is sincere in calling upon 
God, especially at night, is raised to a position of glory. 

rf(80) The reference here is a prophecy of the Prophet's Flight, entering 
Madinah and going forth from Makkah. But the words are also general, man 
being taught here to pray that his entering into any affair and his exit may be 
marked by truthfulness, and that he may be granted Divine help in all his under- 
takings. 

e (81) The advent of the Prophet is here spoken of as the advent of the Truth, 
in reference to the prophecy in John 16:13: "However, when he, the Spirit of 
truth, has come, he will guide you into all truth; for he will not speak on his own 
authority, but whatever he hears he will speak; and he will tell you things to 
come." The vanishing of falsehood is here spoken of in the past tense to indicate 
the certainty of its occurrence. Falsehood finally disappeared from Makkah when 
the Prophet entered it as a conqueror, and as the House of the Holy One was 
cleared of the idols, the Prophet recited this verse, The Truth has come and false- 
hood vanished (Bukhari, 46:32), thus showing that he understood it to contain the 



352 17. THE ISRAELITES • 17 : 82 

82 And the Quran that We reveal is a healing and a mercy to 
the believers, and it only increases the wrongdoers in loss. a 83 And 
when We bestow favours on man, he turns away and behaves 
proudly; and when evil afflicts him, he is in despair. 84 Say: Every- 
one acts according to his manner. But your Lord best knows who 
is best guided on the path. 

Section 10: The Quran — a Unique Guidance 

85 And they ask you about the revelation/ Say: The reve- 
lation is by the commandment of my Lord, and you are not given 
knowledge but a little. 86 And if We please, We could certainly take 
away what We have revealed to you, then you would find none to 
plead (your cause) against Us — 87 But it is a mercy from your Lord. 
Surely His bounty to you is abundant. 

88 Say: If people and jinn should combine together to bring 
the like of this Quran, they could not bring the like of it, though 
they helped one another. 89 And certainly We have made clear for 

prophecy of the conquest of Makkah. The statement made here, however, is 
general and it means that falsehood cannot stand before Truth and that Truth must 
finally prevail in the whole world. 

a (82) The Quran is here called a healing and a mercy for spiritual diseases, 
and history bears testimony that spiritual diseases were all swept away by the 
Quran. But, it is added, it is a healing for the believers who follow it, and not for 
those who reject it, and its rejection brings only greater loss. 

b (84) Both the believer and the disbeliever act according to the rules of con- 
duct which they have set before themselves. Who is on the right path is made 
clear by the consequences which appear later but which are always known to God. 

c (85) The word ruh means inspiration or revelation as well as spirit. Here, 
before this verse as well as after it, the Quran is the only topic of discussion, and 
therefore the context shows clearly that the question of the disbelievers is not about 
the soul of man, but about the Quran itself. 

rf(88) See 2:23 and 11:13 footnote. Out of the four places in which the 
disbelievers are challenged to produce the like of the Quran, this is the only one 
where the jinn and the people are spoken of together; in all the other places the 
shuhada ', meaning helpers, leaders or their great men, take the place of the jinn. 
This shows that the word jinn is used in the Quran for the leaders of evil. 



17 : 90 • JUSTICE OF RETRIBUTION 353 

people in this Quran every kind of description, but most people 
consent only to denying. 90 And they say: We will by no means 
believe in you, till you cause a spring to gush forth from the earth 
for us, 91 or>>ou have a garden of palms and grapes in the midst of 
which you cause rivers to flow forth abundantly, 92 or you cause 
the heaven to come down upon us in pieces, as you think, or bring 
Allah and the angels face to face (with us), 93 or you have a house 
of gold, or you ascend into heaven. And we will not believe in 
your ascending till you bring down to us a book we can read. Say: 
Glory be to my Lord! Am I anything but a mortal messenger? c 

Section 1 1 : Justice of Retribution 

94 And nothing prevents people from believing, when the 
guidance comes to them, except that they say: Has Allah raised up 
a mortal to be a messenger? 95 Say: If there had been in the earth 
angels walking about secure, We would have sent down to them 
from the heaven an angel as messenger. 96 Say: Allah is sufficient 
for a witness between me and you. Surely He is ever Aware of His 
servants, Seer (of them). 

97 And he whom Allah guides, he is on the right way; and he 
whom He leaves in error, for them you will find no guardians 
besides Him. And We shall gather them together on the day of 
Resurrection on their faces, blind and dumb and deaf. Their abode 
is hell. Whenever it abates, We make them burn the more. 



a (89) It is here affirmed that all that contributes to the moral and spiritual 
welfare of man is made distinct in the Quran. 

b (90) The signs demanded in this and the following three verses relate to the 
promises made for the righteous and the threats of punishment for the wicked, and 
they were no doubt fulfilled in due time. But the disbelievers wanted to see the 
spiritual blessings of communion with God in a physical shape. The believers were 
granted gardens with rivers running in them even in this life, and punishment 
from heaven overtook the opponents, but this was to come about gradually. 

c (93) The answer to all the demands of the disbelievers is that the Prophet 
was only a mortal messenger, and the prophecies regarding his own great future 
or the discomfiture of his enemies would be brought to fulfilment gradually, as in 
the case of messengers before him. 



354 17. THE ISRAELITES • 17 : 98 

98 This is their retribution because they disbelieve in Our messages 
and say: When we are bones and decayed particles, shall we then 
be raised up into a new creation? "Do they not see that Allah, 
Who created the heavens and the earth, is Able to create the like 
of them? And He has appointed for them a term, of which there is 
no doubt. But the wrongdoers consent only to denying. 100 Say: If 
you control the treasures of the mercy of my Lord, then you would 
withhold (them) for fear of spending. And man is ever miserly. 

Section 12: Comparison with Moses 

101 And certainly We gave Moses nine clear signs; so ask the 
Children of Israel. When he came to them, Pharaoh said to him: 
Surely I think you, Moses, to be one bewitched. 102 He said: Truly 
you know that none but the Lord of the heavens and the earth has 
sent these as clear proofs; and surely I believe you, Pharaoh, to be 
lost. 103 So he desired to scare them from the land, but We drowned 
him and those with him, all together; 104 and We said to the 
Children of Israel after him: Abide in the land. But when the latter 
promise came, We brought you all rolled up." 

105 And with truth have We revealed it, and with truth did it 
come. And We have not sent you but as a giver of good news and 
as a warner. 106 And it is a Quran We have made distinct, so that 
you may read it to the people by slow degrees, and We have 
revealed it in portions. 

107 Say: Believe in it or do not believe. Surely those who are 
given the knowledge before it, fall down prostrate on their faces, 
when it is recited to them, 108 and they say: Glory be to our Lord! 
Surely the promise of our Lord was to be fulfilled.* 109 And they fall 



a (104) The latter promise here relates to the promise given to Moses for the 
raising up of another prophet like him. This is corroborated by what is said in the 
next verse about the revelation of the Quran, which came with truth, i.e., in fulfil- 
ment of a true promise. By the rolling up of the Israelites is meant that they would 
make way for another people, who would inherit the kingdom of God. 

b (108) The promise spoken of here is no doubt the promise given to the 
former prophets regarding the advent of the Holy Prophet; and by knowledge in 
the previous verse is also meant knowledge of the prophecies .

down on their faces, weeping, and it adds to their humility. 
no Say: Call on Allah or call on the Beneficent. a By whatever 
(name) you call on Him, He has the best names. And do not be 
loud in your prayer nor be silent in it, and seek a way between 
these. m And say: Praise be to Allah! Who has not taken to Him- 
self a son, and Who does not have a partner in the kingdom, and 
Who does not have a helper because of weakness; and proclaim 
His greatness, magnifying (Him). 



a (110-1) The name Rahman (Beneficent) seems to have been particularly 
objectionable to the Arabs, who objected to its use even so late as the truce at 
Hudaibiyah. The Christians also do not recognize Allah to be Rahman, because it 
means that Allah shows mercy to His creatures without their having done any- 
thing to deserve it, while the Christian doctrine of atonement is based on the belief 
that Allah cannot show mercy to His creatures without receiving some satisfac- 
tion. 

b (110-2) The two extremes with regard to prayer are its utterance in a very 
loud voice or not uttering any word at all with the tongue, thinking that God 
knows what is in the hearts. Muslims are told to take the middle course between 
the two extremes. Utterance of words makes the prayer go deeper down into the 
heart of man, and thus makes it more effective. 



Chapter 18 
Ai-Kahf The Cave 

This chapter deals with both the early state of Christianity, when it was under 
persecution and practised renunciation of the world, and prophetically with 
its latter-day condition when Christian nations have acquired unsurpassed 
material dominance in the world. It is called The Cave because early Chris- 
tians sought refuge in such places from persecution and practised monkery in 
solitude. In the first as well as the last section the doctrine of the Divine 
sonship of Jesus is denounced (v. 4, v. 102) and the purely material engross- 
ment of these nations is prophesied to lead to material and spiritual failure (v. 
7-8, v. 103-104). In between, the chapter treats the following subjects: a 
story from early Christianity of the dwellers of the cave, containing propheti- 
cal allusions to its later history, rejection of the truth by those who possess 
wealth and power, the guilty being brought to judgment, a story of Moses' 
search for knowledge and finding a man of God superior to him in know- 
ledge, indicating the coming of Islam, and a story of King Darius I and his 
efforts to repel the two tribes of Gog and Magog, which again contains a pro- 
phetical allusion to the rise and dominance of modern Western nations. This 
chapter was revealed in the early period at Makkah. 



Section 1 : A Warning to the Christians 

In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful. 

1 Praise be to Allah! Who revealed the Book to His servant, 
and did not allow in it any crookedness, 2 rightly directing," to give 
warning of severe punishment from Him and to give good news to 
the believers who do good that theirs is a goodly reward, 3 staying 
in it forever; 4 and to warn those who say: Allah has taken to Him- 
self a son. 5 They have no knowledge of it, nor had their fathers. 
Grievous is the word that comes out of their mouths. They speak 



a (2) The Quran is here described as possessing two qualifications. The first 
refers to its own perfection, there is no crookedness in it; and the second speaks 
of it as a book suited to make others perfect, for it is called qayyim, as meaning 
one that rightly directs others.

18:6« A WARNING TO THE CHRISTIANS 357 

nothing but a lie. " 6 Then perhaps you will kill yourself with grief, 
sorrowing after them, if they do not believe in this announce- 
ment. 

7 Surely We have made whatever is on the earth an embellish- 
ment for it, so that We may try which of them is best in works. 
8 And We shall surely make what is on it dust, without vegetation/ 



a (5) The Holy Prophet is reported to have said: He who remembers the first 
ten verses of the chapter entitled The Cave is protected from the tribulation of 
Dajjal (the Antichrist) (Sahih Muslim, 6:42). In another report the last ten verses 
of The Cave instead of the first ten are mentioned (Abu Dawud, 36:12). Now in 
the first and the last sections of this chapter the Christian doctrine of the divinity 
of Jesus is condemned. In the first section a warning is given to those who say 
Allah has taken to Himself a son (v. 4), in the last two to those who take My ser- 
vants to befriends besides Me (v. 102), and this doctrine, the doctrine of sonship 
and of the divinity of a servant of God, is the basic doctrine of the Christian reli- 
gion. Moreover, in the concluding ten verses, a true description of the occupation 
of Christian nations is given in the words whose effort goes astray in this world's 
life (v. 104). The Holy Prophet's saying quoted above plainly shows that the 
Dajjal of the Hadith is the same as the upholders of the erroneous Christian doc- 
trine of the sonship and divinity of Jesus Christ. Christianity, in its present form, 
being opposed to the true teachings of Christ, is thus the only Antichrist known to 
the Quran. 

b (6) The anxiety which the Holy Prophet felt on account of a fallen huma- 
nity was so great that he is spoken of here as almost killing himself with grief. His 
was a life of absolute devotion to the cause of humanity, his only concern being 
that man should rise to the true dignity for which God had made him. This anxiety 
was not only for those who were directly addressed by him, but, as the context 
shows, it was as deep for another people, who attributed a son to the Divine Being, 
and whom outward finery was to mislead to such an extent as to make them 
strangers to spiritual truth. Reading the next verse leaves no doubt that the 
Prophet was shown the earthly embellishments which are so great a trial for 
Christendom today. The word announcement here refers to the Quran. 

c (8) The picture drawn here is of the beautiful cities of the modern age, with 
all their attractions and luxuries, which so engross people that they neither pay 
attention to the preaching of truth nor to the pursuit of righteousness. The earth 
will be first beautified to its utmost, we are told here, and then laid waste, by man's 
own hands, lofty buildings being reduced to dust and beautiful gardens being 
turned into bare earth without any vegetation on it. All prophecies made known 
through the righteous servants of God, the prophets of the Old Testament and 
Jesus Christ, and then through the Quran and the Hadith, point to world-wide 
conflicts in the latter days, of nation rising against nation, and of destruction of 



358 18. THE CAVE -18:9 

9 0r, do you think that the companions of the Cave and the Inscrip- 
tion were from among Our wonderful signs?" 10 When the youths 
sought refuge in the Cave, they said: Our Lord, grant us mercy 
from Yourself, and provide for us a right course in our affair. n So 
We prevented them from hearing in the Cave for a number of 
years, 4 12 then We raised them up that We might know which 

cities on a vast scale. Science first embellished the earth and science is now turn- 
ing it into a waste, by its atom bombs and other diabolic inventions. 

a (9) The Cave stands for the Christian institution of monkery, this being the 
distinctive characteristic which it assumed soon after its birth. Raqim means an 
inscription or a tablet with a writing upon it. The Inscription contains a propheti- 
cal reference to an aspect of the Christian religion quite opposed to its first aspect 
of growth in the Cave. Inscription (or Advertisement) is, in fact, as prominent a 
feature of the business activities of the Christian nations of today as the Cave was 
a feature of their religious activities in the early days. The Quran seems to have 
chosen the epithets to designate the Christian nations by indicating their most pro- 
minent characteristics in their early and their latter days. 

The account from here to v. 22 is generally identified with the memorable 
story of the "seven sleepers", Christian youths who took refuge in a cave to escape 
the persecution of the Roman Emperor Decius around the year 250 C.E. Accord- 
ing to the story, the Emperor ordered the entrance to the cave to be blocked with 
stones. It is stated that the youths fell asleep as soon as they were shut up in the 
cave, and awoke 187 years after this in the reign of Theodosius (some state 375 
years), when the stones were removed to supply building material for some edifice. 
They then sent one of their number to bring food for them from the city, but he 
was taken to the judge on presenting a coin of the reign of Decius, and thus the 
youths were discovered. The story as narrated in the Quran does not credit the 
unnatural incidents of the above account. It only speaks of some men having 
taken refuge in a dark cave on account of a religious persecution; where and when 
it does not state. After they had rested for a part of a day, they made arrangements 
to get their food from outside (v. 19), and remained in this condition for "a 
number of years" (v. 11), but were subsequently discovered, and an edifice being 
built at the mouth of the cave caused their death (v. 21). It mentions conjectures 
as to their number and the number of years they remained in the cave (v. 22), but 
does not go beyond saying that there were some men who remained in the cave 
for some years. 

However, the story itself is not without a deeper meaning, and more state- 
ments than one show that there is a reference to the history of Christianity itself in 
the story. 

b (11) The meaning is that these people remained cut off from the rest of the 
world for a number of years. The Quran does not support the story that they 
remained in the cave for hundreds of years or that they were asleep all this time. 



18 : 13 • THE DWELLERS IN THE CAVE 359 

of the two parties was best able to calculate the time for which 
they remained." 

Section 2: The Dwellers in the Cave 

13 We relate to you their story with truth. Surely they were 
youths who believed in their Lord and We increased them in 
guidance. 14 And We strengthened their hearts when they stood up 
and said: Our Lord is the Lord of the heavens and the earth; we 
call upon no god beside Him, for then indeed we should utter an 
enormity. 

15 These our people have taken gods beside Him. Why do 
they not bring clear authority for them? Who is then more unjust 
than he who forges a lie against Allah? 16 And when you withdraw 
from them and what they worship except Allah, take refuge in the 
Cave; your Lord will spread forth for you some of His mercy, and 
provide for you a profitable course in your affair. 

17 And you might see the sun, when it rose, decline from their 
Cave to the right, and when it set leave them behind on the left, 
while they were in a wide space of it. c This is from among the 
signs of Allah. He whom Allah guides, he is on the right way; and 
whom He leaves in error, you will not find for him a friend to 
guide aright. 

Section 3: The Dwellers in the Cave 

18 And you might think them awake while they were asleep, 
and We turned them about to the right and to the left, with their 



a (12) The raising them up might signify raising them up from sleep, as also 
raising them up into a condition of activity, after their remaining cut off from the 
world, as stated in the previous verse. 

b (14) This is to show that the early followers of Christianity were Unitarians 
— believers in one God only. 

c (17) This describes the position of the cave, which was so situated that it 
did not admit sunshine. This could easily happen in a cave with its mouth to the 
north, situated in the northern hemisphere and above the tropic of cancer. With 
reference to the history of Christianity it may indicate its coming to Europe. 



360 18. THE CAVE -18:19 

dog outstretching its paws at the entrance. If you looked at them, 
you would turn back from them in flight, and you would be filled 
with awe because of them." 

19 And thus did We rouse them that they might question each 
other. A speaker from among them said: How long have you 
stayed? They said: We have stayed for a day or a part of a day. 
(Others) said: Your Lord knows best how long you have stayed. 
Now send one of you with this silver (coin) of yours to the city, 
then let him see what food is purest, and bring you provision from 
it, and let him behave with gentleness, and not make your case 
known to anyone. c 20 For if they prevail against you, they would 
stone you to death or force you back to their religion, and then you 
would never succeed. 



a (18) What is related in this section is clearly applicable to the story of the 
seven sleepers, as also to the later history of Christianity. In the first case, the 
meaning is that the youths, who fled for fear of persecution and betook them- 
selves to a cave, slept for some time with a dog at the door of the cave. The whole 
scene was rather awe-inspiring: a dark cave, in some distant and uninhabited part 
of the country, with some men sleeping in it and a dog at the door. Applied to the 
history of Christianity the statement is equally true. In this case it should be borne 
in mind that ruqud ("asleep") also means inactive or stagnant. Similarly aiqaz 
("awake") means vigilant or wary. The turning about to the right and to the left, 
which signifies an uneasy condition while sleeping, may be used as expressing the 
activities of a man or a nation. Thus there may be a reference here to the lethargy 
in which the Christian nations remained for a long time, and to their subsequent 
going about in the world in all directions. It may also be noted that Europeans are 
generally fond of dogs. 

b (19-1) This may refer either to the time for which the youths slept or to the 
centuries of inactivity of the Christian nations. A day of a thousand years is 
spoken of in the Quran (see 22:47, etc.), and therefore the word day, applied to 
the history of a nation, may signify a thousand years. 

c (19-2) After having been refreshed with sleep, which might have been 
brought on by the fatigue of the journey, they thought of procuring food for them- 
selves in that solitary cave and sent one of them to the city, and impressed on him 
that he should be gentle and should not give an inkling of their whereabouts to 
anyone. In reference to the history of Christianity, this speaks of the commercial 
activities of the Christian nations (i.e. in Asia and Africa, by means of which their 
rule was established. The words "and not make your case known to anyone" apply 
to their hidden intentions of gaining rule under the pretext of trade. — Editor) 



18:21' THE DWELLERS IN THE CAVE 361 

21 And thus did We make (people) to get knowledge of 
them," that they might know that Allah's promise is true and that 
the Hour — there is no doubt about it.* When they disputed 
among themselves about their affair and said: Erect an edifice 
over them. c Their Lord knows best about them. Those who 
prevailed in their affair said: We shall certainly build a place of 
worship over them. 22 (Some) say: (They were) three, the fourth 
of them their dog; and (others) say: Five, the sixth of them their 
dog, making conjectures about the unseen. And (others) say: 
Seven, and the eighth of them their dog. Say: My Lord best knows 
their number — none knows them but a few. So do not contend in 
their matter but with a clear argument, and do not question any of 
them concerning them. 6 



a (21-1) It was their going out to purchase food that brought them to the 
knowledge of the outside world. It is not stated how long they continued in this 
state. Comparing this with v. 11, however, we may say that they passed several 
years in this condition. 

b (21-2) The result of their becoming known is described in words which 
show that they were put to death, because the promise of Allah as to a future state 
of life is fully realized only after death. 

c (21-3) These words show that their death was brought about by closing the 
mouth of the cave. This is what is meant by the erection of an edifice over them. 
The words may also signify the erection of a monument. 

d (21-4) The people spoken of here are those who prevailed in their affair. 
This is a later incident, when Christianity became the dominant religion of the 
Roman Empire, and the reference here seems to be to the saint-worship which 
was prevalent in Christianity. 

e (22) This verse and v. 25 show that these are only conjectures of the people 
with regard to them. Their number and the number of years during which they 
remained in the cave are both matters which are said to be only known to Allah. 
Ibn Abbas is, however, of the opinion that the words condemning the first two as 
conjectures show that the last-mentioned number, i.e., seven, is correct. {Editor's 
Note: In his Urdu commentary, Maulana Muhammad Ali has applied this number 
to the number of Western powers, whose number varies depending on whether 
they are counted individually or in groups according to their treaty alliances.) 

According to Ibn Jarir's commentary the people referred to in the concluding 
words, any of them, are the people of the Book, or the Christians. It is clear from 
this that it is really the history of Christianity that is dealt with in the story of the 
Companions of the Cave. V. 25, which again speaks of the same people who are 



362 18. THE CAVE -18:23 



Section 4: The Quran as a Guidance 

23 And do not say of anything: I will do that tomorrow, 
24 unless Allah please." And remember jour Lord when you forget 
and say: Maybe my Lord will guide me to a nearer course to the 
right than this. 

25 And they remained in their cave three hundred years, and 
they add nine. e 26 Say: Allah knows best how long they remained. 
His is the unseen of the heavens and the earth. How clear His sight 
and His hearing! There is no guardian for them beside Him, and 
He takes none as partner in His judgment. 

27 And recite what has been revealed to you of the Book of 



spoken of here, makes it clear that it is the history of Christianity that is really 
aimed at. 

a (24-1) Though the words are general, there seems to be a special prophetic 
reference to the Prophet's Flight and his taking refuge in a cave. He had entirely 
to trust in Allah, Who was to bring it about as He thought best for him. 

b (24-2) The meaning is that the difficulties which had to be experienced by 
the dwellers in the cave would be removed from the Prophet's way. He had to 
pass only three days in the cave, and though a powerful enemy exerted itself to its 
utmost, his hiding-place at only a distance of three miles from the city, whither 
food was conveyed to him, could not be discovered. Or, in the nearer course there 
is a reference to the unprecedented triumph of Islam, which spread over the whole 
of Arabia within twenty-three years, and spread from Spain in the west to China 
in the east within a century, whereas Christianity remained in a state of subjection 
in its birth-place for three hundred years, as stated in the verse that follows. 

c (25) The history of Christianity, which runs like an undercurrent in the 
story of the Companions of the Cave, finds a clear expression now. There is no 
tradition that the Companions of the Cave remained in the Cave for three hundred 
years, but Christianity itself remained in a Cave for full three hundred years. It is 
a fact that Christianity rose to power with the conversion of Constantine, and at 
the same time it lost its purity with the formulation of the doctrine of the Trinity, 
which was promulgated in 325 C.E. It is, moreover, now almost agreed that Jesus 
Christ was born in 6-5 B.C. So if he began his ministry at the age of thirty, the 
Christian religion may be said to have been born at about 25 C.E., and thus exactly 
after three hundred years it lost its purity by the promulgation of the Trinitarian 
doctrine, emerging at the same time as a State religion. Thus it remained in the 
Cave for three hundred years. As to adding nine years, to convert solar years to 
lunar years three years have to be added to every hundred years, and to the three 
centuries another nine years are thus added. 



18:28' A PARABLE 363 

jour Lord. There is none who can alter His words. a And you will 
find no refuge beside Him. 28 And keep yourself with those who 
call on their Lord morning and evening desiring His goodwill, and 
let not your eyes pass from them, desiring the beauties of this 
world's life. And do not follow him whose heart We have made 
unmindful of Our remembrance, and he follows his low desires 
and his case exceeds due bounds. 29 And say: The Truth is from 
your Lord; so whoever wishes, let him believe, and whoever wishes, 
let him disbelieve. Surely We have prepared for the wrongdoers a 
Fire, an enclosure of which will encompass them. And if they cry 
for water, they are given water like molten brass, scalding their 
faces. Evil the drink! And ill the resting-place! 30 As for those 
who believe and do good, We do not waste the reward of him who 
does a good work. 31 These it is for whom are Gardens of 
perpetuity in which rivers flow; they are adorned therein with 
bracelets of gold, and they wear green robes of fine silk and thick 
brocade, reclining therein on raised couches. c Excellent the recom- 
pense! And goodly the resting-place! 

Section 5: A Parable 

32 And set forth to them the parable of two men — for one of 
them We made two gardens of grape-vines, and We surrounded 



a (27) By "words" are meant here prophecies, because it is the prophecy of 
the Prophet's Flight and his final triumph over his enemies that is referred to here. 
These prophecies, it is claimed, cannot be altered by people, and they must come 
to pass, however great the opposing forces. 

b (29) They refused the water of spiritual life in this life, and so they will 
have no water to quench their thirst in the life after death. 

c (31) It is after these things that people hanker in this life, but the ornaments 
and robes of this life are transitory. The righteous, who in this life desire and 
struggle for only spiritual ornaments and moral beauty, find these visible in the 
after-life. However, these prophecies were in one sense brought to fulfilment in 
this very life also. The Arabs, whose only wealth consisted of their camels and 
horses, and whose clothes were made of skins or cloth of rough textures, found 
the treasures of Rome and Persia laid at their feet, and the bracelets of gold and 
the silk brocade interwoven with gold, which they had never seen before, were now 
brought to them in abundance, while the gardens of Mesopotamia and Persia were 
given to them for a permanent heritage. 



364 18. THE CAVE -18:33 

them with date-palms, and between them We made corn-fields. " 
33 Both these gardens yielded their fruits, and did not fail in this at 
all, and We caused a river to gush forth in their midst, 34 and he 
had fruit. So he said to his companion, while arguing with him: 
I have more wealth than you, and am greater in followers. 35 And 
he went into his garden, while he was unjust to himself. He said: I 
do not think that this will ever perish, 36 and I do not think the Hour 
will come; and even if I am returned to my Lord, I will certainly 
find a better place of return than this. 

37 His companion said to him, while arguing with him: Do 
you disbelieve in Him Who created you of dust, then of a small 
life -germ, then He made you a perfect man? 38 But as for me, He, 
Allah, is my Lord, and I set up none as partner with my Lord. 
39 And why did you not say, when you entered your garden: It is as 
Allah has pleased — there is no power except in Allah? If you 
consider me as less than you in wealth and children — 40 then 
maybe my Lord will give me better than your garden, and will send 
on (yours) a reckoning from heaven so that it is dust without plant, 
41 or its water will sink down into the ground, so that you are unable 
to find it. 42 And his fruit was destroyed; so he began to wring his 
hands for what he had spent on it, as it lay waste, its roofs fallen 
down, c and he said: Ah me! I wish I had not set up any partner 
with my Lord! 43 And he had no forces to help him against Allah, 
nor could he defend himself. 44 Thus protection is only Allah's, the 
True One. He is best to (give) reward and best for (determining) 
the final end. 



a (32) The parable set forth here is undoubtedly to illustrate the condition of 
the Christian and the Muslim nations. The former received an abundance of the 
wealth of this life, as is indicated by the gardens of the parable, while the latter, 
though poorer in worldly possessions, were richer in the heavenly blessings of 
Allah. The former reject the message of Truth, of which the latter are the bearers, 
and their vaunt is the same as that of the wealthy man in the parable: / have more 
wealth than you, and am greater in followers (v. 34). 

b (36) By the "Hour" is meant the hour of doom which must overtake every 
people who reject the Truth. 

c (42) Here we have an exact description of the havoc that is being wrought 
in the world before our eyes by modern wars. 



1 8 : 45 • THE GUILTY ARE BROUGHT TO JUDGMENT 365 

Section 6: The Guilty are brought to Judgment 

45 And set forth to them the likeness of the life of this world 
as water which We send down from the cloud, so the vegetation of 
the earth becomes luxuriant by it, then it becomes dry, broken into 
pieces which the winds scatter. And Allah is the Holder of power 
over all things. 46 Wealth and children are an adornment of the life 
of this world; but the ever-abiding, the good works, are better with 
jour Lord in reward and better in hope. 47 And the day when We 
cause the mountains to pass away, and you see the earth a levelled 
plain and We gather them together and leave none of them 
behind." 48 And they are brought before your Lord in ranks. Now 
certainly you have come to Us as We created you at first. But you 
thought that We had not made an appointment for you. 49 And the 
book is placed, and you see the guilty fearing for what is in it, and 
they say: O woe to us! What a book is this! It leaves out neither a 
small thing nor a great one, but numbers them (all), and they find 
what they did confronting them. And your Lord does not wrong 
anyone. 

Section 7: Their Helplessness 

50 And when We said to the angels: Be submissive to Adam, 
they submitted, but not Iblls. He was from among the jinn, so he 
transgressed the commandment of his Lord. c Will you then take 
him and his offspring for friends rather than Me, and they are your 
enemies? Evil is the exchange for the unjust. 51 I did not make 
them witness the creation of the heavens and the earth, nor their 
own creation. Nor could I take those who mislead for aiders. 



a (47) Making the earth a levelled plain indicates the removal of all those 
mighty obstacles which stood in the way of the advancement of Truth, and 
these are the mountains which are made to pass away; see 20:105-107. 

b (49) This comprehensive book is the same as is spoken of in 17:13-14. 
There is not the slightest action, good or bad, which does not leave its effect 
behind. 

c (50) Iblls is one of the jinn or the evil spirits, so it is an error to take him 
for an angel or a good spirit. The spirit of evil is always rebellious, and it is 
against this that man is warned, so that he should resist every evil tendency. 



366 18. THE CAVE -18:52 

52 And one day He will say: Call on those whom you considered to 
be My partners. So they will call on them, but they will not 
answer them, and We shall cause a separation between them. 
53 And the guilty will see the Fire, and know that they are about to 
fall into it, and they will find no escape from it. 

Section 8: Warning is disregarded 

54 And certainly We have made distinct in this Quran for 
mankind every kind of description; and man is in most things con- 
tentious. 55 And nothing prevents people from believing when the 
guidance comes to them, and from asking forgiveness of their Lord, 
but that (they wait) for the way of the ancients to catch up with 
them, or that the punishment should confront them. 56 And We do 
not send messengers but as givers of good news and warning, and 
those who disbelieve contend by means of falsehood to weaken 
thereby the Truth, and they take My messages and the warning for 
a mockery. 57 And who is more unjust than he who is reminded of 
the messages of his Lord, then he turns away from them and forgets 
what his hands have already done? Surely We have placed veils 
over their hearts, so they do not understand it, and a deafness in 
their ears. a And if you call them to the guidance, they will even 
then never follow the right course. 

58 And jour Lord is Forgiving, full of mercy. If He were to 
punish them for what they earn, He would certainly hasten the 
punishment for them. But for them there is an appointed time from 
which they will find no refuge. 59 And these towns — We destroyed 
them when they did wrong. And We have appointed a time for 
their destruction. 



a (57) It is when man becomes so iniquitous as to turn away from the truth 
and so callous as not to care for the evil that he does that a veil is placed over his 
heart. 

b (59) The personal pronoun their refers to the opponents of Truth, earlier as 
well as later. 



18 : 60 'MOSES TRAVELS IN SEARCH OF KNOWLEDGE 367 

Section 9: Moses travels in Search of Knowledge 

60 And when Moses said to his servant: " I will not cease until 
I reach the junction of the two rivers, or I will go on for years. 
61 So when they reached the junction of the two (rivers), they forgot 
their fish, and it took its way into the river, being free. 62 But when 
they had gone further, he said to his servant: Bring us our morning 
meal, we have certainly found this journey of ours tiring. 63 He (the 
servant) said: Did you see when we took refuge on the rock, I 
forgot the fish, and none but the devil made me forget to speak of 
it, and it took its way into the river; what a wonder! c 64 He said: 
This is what we sought for. So they returned retracing their foot- 
steps. 



a (60-1) Some reports give his name as Joshua, the son of Nun, the man who 
afterwards appears so prominently in the history of Israel. 

The incidents narrated in verses 60-82 may be the actual experience of 
Moses or this journey may simply be an Ascension of Moses, like the Ascension 
(Mi 'raj) of the Holy Prophet, referred to in the last chapter. What is stated in the 
next section makes the latter view more probable. 

b (60-2) Moses lived in Egypt for forty years, and the junction of the two 
rivers (Majma ' al-Bahrain) is no other than the junction of the two great branches 
of the Nile at Khartoum. Rabbinical and Hellenistic literature agree that Moses 
went to Ethiopia. Hence a journey to Khartoum, which was near the southern 
boundary of Ethiopia, made in search of knowledge, is most probable. Some 
commentators, however, do not take these words literally, taking the meaning to 
be the union of the rivers of human and Divine knowledge. I would, however, 
suggest that if we accept this journey in the light of an Ascension, it would be an 
indication of the limitation of the Mosaic dispensation. Moses' going on for years 
until he reached the "the junction of the two rivers" would mean that the Mosaic 
dispensation would see its termination after a time, being replaced by one which 
was to be guided by a prophet who is the union of the two seas of human and 
Divine knowledge, or one in whom the temporal and the spiritual would find their 
highest manifestation, this being the Holy Prophet Muhammad. 

c (63) The loss of the fish was, according to a report, to serve as a sign that 
the goal had been attained (Bukhari, 3:44). There is nothing either in the Quran or 
in the Hadith to show that this was a roasted fish. Taking refuge on the rock shows 
that they were staying at a place which was flooded by the river, and Moses' 
companion, when hastening for refuge, forgot to take the fish along with him. The 
wonder is not expressed at the fish having gone down into the river, but because 
he had forgotten to mention the loss to Moses. 



368 18. THE CAVE -18:65 

65 Then they found one of Our servants whom We had granted 
mercy from Us and whom We had taught knowledge from Our- 
selves." 66 Moses said to him: May I follow you that you may 
teach me some of the good you have been taught? 67 He said: Fou 
will not be able to have patience with me. 68 And how can you 
have patience in matters in which you do not have a compre- 
hensive knowledge? 69 He said: If Allah please, you will find me 
patient, nor shall I disobey you in anything. 70 He said: If you would 
follow me, do not question me about anything until I myself speak 
to you about it. 

Section 10: Moses travels in Search of Knowledge 

71 So they set out, until, when they embarked in a boat, he made 
a hole in it. (Moses) said: Have you made a hole in it to drown its 
occupants? Fou have surely done a terrible thing. 72 He said: Did I 
not say that you will not be able to have patience with me? 73 He 
said: Do not blame me for what I forgot, and do not be hard upon 
me for what I did. 

74 So they went on, until, when they met a boy, he killed him. 
(Moses) said: Have you killed an innocent person, not guilty of 
* killing another? Fou have indeed done a horrible thing. * 75 He 
said: Did I not say to you that you will not be able to have patience 
with me? 76 He said: If I ask you about anything after this, do not 
keep company with me. Fou will then indeed have found an excuse 
in my case. 

77 So they went on, until, when they came to the people of a 
town, they asked its people for food, but they refused to entertain 
them as guests. Then they found in it a wall which was on the 
point of falling, so he put it into a right state. (Moses) said: If you 
had wished, you could have taken a recompense for it. 78 He said: 
This is the parting between me and you. Now I will inform you of 
the significance of that about which you could not have patience. 

79 As for the boat, it belonged to poor people working on the 



a (65) His name was Khadir (Bukhari, 3:44). 



ss 



18 : 80 "MOSES TRAVELS IN SEARCH OF KNOWLEDGE 369 

river, and I intended to damage it, for there was behind them a 
king who seized every boat by force. 80 And as for the boy, his 
parents were believers and we feared that he might involve them 
in wrongdoing and disbelief." 81 So we intended that their Lord 
might give them in his place one better in purity and nearer to 
mercy. 82 And as for the wall, it belonged to two orphan boys in 
the city, and there was beneath it a treasure belonging to them, and 
their father had been a righteous man. So your Lord intended that 
they should attain their maturity and take out their treasure — a 
mercy from your Lord — and I did not do it of my own accord. 
This is the significance of that about which you could not have 
patience. 6 



a (80) That the youth himself deserved death is abundantly clear. His inordi- 
nacy had now reached an extreme when it was feared that his innocent parents 
would be involved in the trouble which must befall him as a result of his wrong- 
doing. The circumstances were known to Khadir, though not to Moses. 

b (82) The interpretation of the three incidents shows a manifestation of 
Divine wisdom in what takes place in the everyday life of man. Divine laws, as 
manifested in nature, are really working towards ultimate good, though sometimes 
they may appear to the outward eye to be working to the detriment of somebody. 
The beneficent hand of Allah that works in nature is always directing humanity to 
the goal of great good, though that goal must necessarily be reached with apparent 
loss. Sometimes the loss is only apparent, as in the case of making a hole in the 
boat; there was no real loss, but the apparent loss served a great purpose and 
brought much benefit to the owner. The second instance is that in which there is 
real loss to a person, but it is for the good of humanity at large, for life must be 
sacrificed for the ultimate good of humanity. The third instance shows that, for 
the good of humanity, deeds must be done which bring no immediate reward, and 
that good done by one generation is not devoid of benefit to the next. 

Moses himself had, in fact, to undergo the experience of his teacher, and the 
incidents seem no more than prophetic allegories of Moses' own life-work. Moses 
had to lead his people to a place where they thought they had only been brought to 
be drowned; but their safe passage through the sea showed that it was for their 
good. Then he had to order his men to fight against an iniquitous people and to 
put them to death, but he was not shedding human blood to no purpose, for it was 
really a step towards the evolution of a better race. And finally, his devoting his 
own life to the Israelites, descendants of a righteous man, corresponded to his 
teacher's building the wall for the orphans without claiming recompense. Read in 
this light, the narration is clearly an Ascension of Moses, foreshadowing the great 
events which were to befall him. 



370 18. THE CAVE -18:83 

Section 1 1 : Dhu-1-qarnain and Gog and Magog 

83 And they ask you about Dhu-1-qarnain." Say: I will recite 
to you an account of him. 84 Truly We established him (with 
power) in the land and granted him means of access to everything; 
8S so he followed a course. 86 Until, when he reached the setting- 
place of the sun, he found it going down into a black sea, e and 
found by it a people. We said: O Dhu-1-qarnain, either punish 
them or do them a benefit. 87 He said: As for him who is unjust, we 
shall punish him, then he will be returned to his Lord, and He will 
punish him with an exemplary punishment. 88 And as for him who 



a (83) Dhu-1-qarnain literally means the two-horned one, or one belonging 
to two generations or two centuries. The reference here seems to be to the two- 
horned ram of Daniel's vision (Daniel, 8:3), which he interpreted as the Kingdoms 
of Media and Persia, which were combined into a single kingdom under one ruler, 
Cyrus, who is erroneously called Darius in the Bible (Encyclopedia Biblica and 
Jewish Encyclopedia, Art. 'Darius'). The reference in Daniel's vision is, however, 
not to Cyrus but to Darius I Hystaspes (521-485 B.C.), "who allowed the Jews to 
rebuild their temple... His liberality towards the Jews is in complete accord with 
what we know otherwise of his general policy in religious matters towards the 
subject nations" (Enc. Biblica, 'Darius'). 

The reference in the Quran in the history of Dhu-1-qarnain is to Darius I: 
"Darius was the organizer of the Persian Empire. His conquests served to round 
off the boundaries of his realm in Armenia, the Caucasus, and India, and along the 
Turanian steppes and the highlands of Central Asia" (Jewish Enc, 'Darius I'). 
The following remarks in the Encyclopaedia Britannica strengthen this view: 
"Darius in his inscriptions appears as a fervent believer in the true religion of 
Zoroaster. But he was also a great statesman and organizer. The time of conquests 
had come to an end; the wars which Darius undertook, like those of Augustus, 
only served the purpose of gaining strong natural frontiers for the empire and 
keeping down the barbarous tribes on its borders. Thus Darius subjugated the wild 
nations of the Pontic and Armenian mountains, and extended the Persian domi- 
nion to the Caucasus; for the same reason he fought against the Sacae and other 
Turanian tribes". The references to Darius being a fervent believer in the true 
religion of Zoroaster, to his subduing the barbarous tribes on the borders, to his 
gaining strong natural frontiers for the empire, and to his fighting against the 
Sacae clearly point him out as the Dhu-1-qamain of the Quran. 

b (86-1) This signifies the western-most point of his empire. 

c (86-2) The place referred to is no other than the Black Sea, as, Armenia 
being within the Kingdom of Persia, the Black Sea formed the northwestern boun- 
dary of the empire.

believes and does good, for him is a good reward, and We shall

89 Then he followed a course. 90 Until, when he reached (the 
land of) the rising sun, he found it rising on a people to whom We 
had given no shelter from it — 91 so it was. And We had full 
knowledge of what he had. 

92 Then he followed a course. 93 Until, when he reached (a 
place) between the two mountains, he found on that side of them a 
people who could hardly understand a word.' 94 They said: Dhu-1- 
qarnain, Gog and Magog do mischief in the land. May we then 
pay you tribute on condition that you raise a barrier between us 
and them? 95 He said: The power with which my Lord has 



a (88) Being a true follower of Zoroaster, the well-known Persian prophet, 
Darius seems to have invited these tribes to his religion. 

b (90) Darius goes first westward to the Black Sea (v. 85-86). Then he 
undertakes an eastward journey — the land of the rising sun. The description of 
the people found here, a people who had no shelter from the sun, is a description 
of the barbarous aboriginal tribes on the shores of the Caspian. 

c (93) The three journeys alluded to seem to have been undertaken with the 
object of strengthening the frontiers of the empire, the most important of these 
being that spoken of here, the part of the frontier between the Caspian and the 
Black Seas, where the Caucasus afforded a natural protection against the attacks 
of the Scythians. The two mountains are the mountains of Armenia and Azarbai- 
jan. The people settling there spoke a different language and could not understand 
the Iranian language. 

rf(94) In the Bible, Ezekiel 38:2 contains the words: "Son of man, set your 
face against Gog, of the land of Magog, the prince of Rosh, Meshech, and Tubal, 
and prophesy against him". North of the Caucasus we find two rivers bearing the 
names of Tobol and Moskva, on the latter of which is situated the ancient city of 
Moscow, and on the former the more recent town of Tobolsk. It seems almost 
certain that these two rivers received their names from the two tribes of Ezekiel 
38:2, the Tubal and Meshech, and then gave their names to the two above- 
mentioned cities. This view is in accordance with the opinion of ancient writers 
like Josephus, who settle the Magog north of the Caucasus. Thus the name Magog 
stands for tribes which occupied territories to the north and north-east of the Black 
Sea, tribes which gave their names directly or indirectly to the towns of Tobolsk 
and Moscow. 

Another point worth considering is the presence of the gigantic effigies of 
Gog and Magog in Guildhall, London, which can be traced to a very early period

established me is better, so if only you help me with strength (of

"Bring me blocks of iron." At length, when he had filled up the 
space between the two mountain sides, he said, Blow. Till, when 
he had made it (as) fire, he said: Bring me molten brass to pour 
over it. 

97 So they were not able to scale it, nor could they make a 
hole in it. 98 He said: This is a mercy from my Lord, but when the 
promise of my Lord comes to pass He will crumble it, and the 
promise of my Lord is ever true.* "And on that day We shall let 

in English history. This makes it probable that the Angles or the Saxons had in 
very ancient times some connection with the Scythians or other tribes living north 
of the Caucasus or the Black Sea. It may be deduced from this that the ancestors 
of the present Teutonic and Slav races, the main nations of eastern and western 
Europe respectively, are the Gog and Magog spoken of in the Quran, both these 
races originating from the same land. 

The next statement, that the tribes found by Darius between Azerbaijan and 
the Armenian mountains were constantly harassed by their northern neighbours, 
the Scythians, is also borne out by history. "About 512 Darius undertook a war 
against the Scythians . . . The purpose of this war can only have been to attack the 
nomadic Turanian tribes in the rear, and thus to secure peace on the northern fron- 
tier of the empire" (Encyclopaedia Britannica, Art. 'Darius'). 

The barrier referred to in this and the following verses is the famous wall at 
Derbent, on the western shore of the Caspian, which had iron gates and numerous 
watch-towers for defence. Its name, Alexander's wall, is a misnomer due to the 
mistake made by Muslim historians in supposing Dhu-1-qamain to be Alexander. 

a (96) The blocks of iron were needed for the iron gates in the wall. 

b (98) From the historical narration of the past, the subject is now changed to 
the future. Gog and Magog are described as two nations, and after describing the 
history of these nations, whose depredations on peaceful nations were brought to 
an end by Darius, we are now told that Gog and Magog will again be let loose in 
the latter days. In fact, this is clearly foretold in another chapter of the same 
period: "when Gog and Magog are let loose and they sally forth from every ele- 
vated place" (21:96). The crumbling of the wall which withheld Gog and Magog 
for a time is thus explained by the Quran itself as the letting loose of Gog and 
Magog. Just as the building of the wall indicated the confinement of Gog and 
Magog to their own territorial bounds, the crumbling of the wall means that they 
will at some future time be let loose and will then dominate the whole world. This 
domination is spoken of in the Hadith in various ways. According to one hadith, 
"No one will have the power to fight against them" (Sahih Muslim, 52:20). 



1 8 : 100 • DHU-L-QARNAIN AND GOG AND MAGOG 373 

some of them surge against others and the trumpet will be blown, 
then We shall gather them all together," 100 and We shall bring 
forth hell, exposed to view, on that day before the disbelievers, 6 
101 whose eyes were under a cover from My Reminder, and they 
could not bear to hear. e 



According to another, "they will drink the water of the whole world" {Kanaz al- 
'Ummal, vol. 7, p. 2157). As shown earlier, the ancestors of Gog and Magog are 
the Slav and Teutonic races, and in the world-domination of Gog and Magog is 
thus clearly hinted the domination of the European nations over the whole world, 
and the prophecy has thus found fulfilment in our days. 

a (99) A mighty conflict of nations is clearly spoken of here, and the words 
no doubt refer to some catastrophe like that which is predicted in the Gospels in 
the words: "For nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom. 
And there will be famines, pestilences, and earthquakes in various places. All 
these are the beginning of sorrows" (Matthew, 24:7-8). 

The Quran makes it clear that the reference in nation rising against nation is 
to the great European conflicts of modern times. Gog and Magog, or the European 
nations, having subdued the whole world, could not agree on the division of the 
spoils, and they are rushing at one another's throats, and the whole world being 
subject to them, their struggle has assumed the form of a world conflict. But if the 
first part of the verse speaks of the destruction due to these wars, the second part 
raises a great hope. A mighty Revolution will come about. That is what is meant 
by the blowing of the trumpet. The revolution would unite them; it would drive 
them to one common faith. Material benefits having turned man into the enemy of 
man, a spiritual awakening will, we are told, be brought about which will change 
the world entirely. Instead of cutting one another's throats people will learn to 
love one another, and they will all be but one nation. There is a broad enough hint 
here at the nation of Islam, for there is but one faith, the faith of Islam, which has 
been able to weld diverse people into one whole. The day of peace for this world 
will dawn with the dawning of the idea on the mind of man that there is only a 
single nation, the human nation, that lives on this earth: "Mankind is a single 
nation" (2:213). 

b (100) These words complete the picture of the great conflict spoken of in 
the previous verse. It describes the severity of the conflict, which will reduce the 
world to a veritable hell. There was hell raging on this earth in World War 2. 
What a World War 3 may bring, no one can say. 

c (101) The reason is given in these words why these disasters will be 
brought on man: These are people whose eyes are under a cover from My Remin- 
der. In fact, they are so estranged from God that they cannot even bear to hear 
His Reminder. So thoroughly have lust and greed engrossed the civilized world!

Section 12: Christian Nations 

102 Do those who disbelieve think that they can take My 
servants to be protectors besides Me? a Surely We have prepared 
hell as an entertainment for the disbelievers. 103 Say: Shall We 
inform you who are the greatest losers in respect of deeds? 
104 Those whose effort is lost in this world's life, and they think 
that they are making good manufactures. 105 Those are they who 
disbelieve in the messages of their Lord and meeting with Him, so 
their deeds are fruitless. Nor shall We set up a balance for them on 
the day of Resurrection. c 106 That is their reward — hell, because 
they disbelieved and held My messages and My messengers in 
mockery. 

107 As for those who believe and do good deeds, for them are 
Gardens of Paradise, an entertainment, 108 to abide therein; they 
will not desire removal from there. 109 Say: If the sea were ink for 
the words of my Lord, the sea would surely be exhausted before 
the words of my Lord were exhausted, even if We brought as 
much again to add (to it). 110 Say: I am only a mortal like you — 



a (102) The Christians are meant here, because theirs is the most prominent 
example of having taken a servant of Allah, a prophet, for God. In fact, Jesus 
Christ is the only person whom the Quran recognizes as a righteous servant of 
God and who has been taken for God by a large part of the world. 

b (104) This is a clear description of the present attitude of the civilized 
nations to their moral and spiritual needs — their effort is entirely wasted in this 
world's life, and they cannot give a moment's consideration to the life after death. 
The portrait of the material civilization, to which Christianity has led, as drawn in 
this section, attains to its most vivid clearness in these words. Manufacture is the 
one speciality and pride of the West. But they are so engrossed in the contest of 
manufactures that they have no thought of God left in their minds. 

c (105) Their deeds are fruitless because what they do relates to the vanities 
of life. They have no vision for the higher values of life, for the ultimate end, 
which is here spoken of as the meeting with the Lord. Hence we are told that no 
balance will be set up for them on the day of Resurrection, because all their deeds 
relate to this life, and end where this life ends. 

d (109) In these words there is a refutation of the Christian doctrine that "the 
word was with God", or that "the word was God" (John 1:1). The words of God 
are so numerous, we are here told, that the sea would be exhausted, if it were to

to meet his Lord, he should do good deeds, and make no one a

serve as ink for writing them. In fact, everything created is a word of God accord- 
ing to the Quran, and things created know no end. 



Chapter 19 

Maryam Mary 

The name of this chapter is taken from the story of Mary, mother of Jesus. It 
begins with an account of the birth of John and of Jesus, the last representa- 
tives of prophecy in the house of Israel, and then refutes the doctrine of the 
Divine sonship of Jesus. It then mentions the missions of some earlier pro- 
phets, showing that only human beings are raised to reform the world. At the 
end the doctrine that Jesus is the son of God is again denounced. This chapter 
was revealed in the early period at Makkah, about or before the fifth year of 
the Holy Prophet's mission. 



Section 1 : Zacharias and John 

In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful. 

1 Sufficient, Guide, Blessed, Knowing, Truthful God." 
2 A mention of the mercy of your Lord to His servant Zacharias — 
3 when he called upon his Lord, crying in secret. 4 He said: My 
Lord, my bones are weakened, and my head flares with whiteness 
(of hair), and I have never been unsuccessful in my prayer to You, 
my Lord. 5 And I fear my kinsfolk after me, and my wife is barren, 
so grant me from Yourself an heir Svho should inherit me and 
inherit from the Children of Jacob, and make him, my Lord, 
acceptable (to You). 

7 O Zacharias, We give you good news of a boy, whose name 
is John: We have not made before anyone his equal. c 8 He said: 



a (1) The original Arabic consists of the letters kaf, ha, ya, 'ain and sad. 
These stand for the words Kaf-in (Sufficient), Had-in (Guide), YamTn (Blessed), 
'Alim (Knowing), and Sadiq (Truthful). 

b (6) His fear was due to their not leading righteous lives, and he feared there 
would be none to lead people into the ways of righteousness after him. The inheri- 
tance of the Children of Jacob is the inheritance of the Divine blessing of prophet- 
hood, which had been promised to Jacob's children. 

c (7) It is not, of course, meant that one like John or equal to him was never

19:9- MARY AND JESUS 377 

My Lord, how shall I have a son, and my wife is barren, and I 
have reached extreme old age? 9 He said: So (it will be). Four Lord 
says: It is easy to Me, and indeed I created you before, when you 
were nothing. 10 He said: My Lord, give me a sign. He said: Four 
sign is that you do not speak to people three nights, being in sound 
health." n So he went forth to his people from the sanctuary and 
proclaimed to them: Glorify (Allah) morning and evening. 

12 O John, take hold of the Book with strength. And We gran- 
ted him wisdom when a child, 13 and kind-heartedness from Us and 
purity. And he was dutiful, 14 and kindly to his parents, and he was 
not insolent, disobedient.* 15 And peace on him the day he was 
born and the day he died, and the day he is raised to life! 

Section 2: Mary and Jesus 

16 And mention Mary in the Book. When she drew aside from 
her family to an eastern place; 17 so she screened herself from them. 
Then We sent to her Our spirit and it appeared to her as a well- 
made man. c 18 She said: I seek refuge from you in the Beneficent, 

before created in the world. According to the Gospels: "among those born of 
women there has not risen one greater than John the Baptist" (Matthew, 11:11). 
The meaning is that one like him was not born in Zacharias' family, because in 
the previous verse it is his own relatives about whom Zacharias says that he feared, 
and therefore an assurance was now given to him that the promised son would not 
be like the other members of his family regarding whom he feared. Or the meaning 
may be that one like him had not appeared in that age. 

a (10) In 3:41 the words are three days, thus showing that three days and three 
nights are meant. The Quran does not support the idea that Zacharias was struck 
dumb, because it speaks of him as being in sound health. The object of assuming 
silence was to be engaged solely in prayer to the Divine Being, and hence Zacharias 
told his people also to glorify God. 

b (14) The various aspects of the character of John deserve to be noted. He 
was pure and sinless and never disobeyed God. In fact, what is said of one pro- 
phet is equally true of all. They are all pure from birth, and never disobey God. 

c (17) It was in a vision that the spirit came, and the conversation that 
follows also took place in a vision. The word tamaththala ("it appeared") lends 
support to this, for it signifies assuming the likeness of another thing, and this 
happens only in a vision. Further, the spirit or angel of God appears to His chosen 
ones only in a vision.

if you are one guarding against evil. 19 He said: I am only bearer of 
a message of your Lord: That I will give you a pure boy. a 20 She 
said: How can I have a son and man has not yet touched me, nor 
have I been unchaste? 21 He said: So (it will be). Four Lord says: It 
is easy to Me; and that We may make him a sign to people and a 
mercy from Us. And it is a matter decreed. 6 

22 Then she conceived him, and withdrew with him to a 
remote place. 23 And the pains of childbirth drove her to the trunk 
of a palm-tree. She said: Oh, I wish I had died before this, and 
had been a thing quite forgotten! 6 24 So a voice came to her from 
beneath her: Do not grieve, surely your Lord has provided a 
stream beneath you. 25 And shake towards you the trunk of the 
palm-tree, it will drop on you fresh ripe dates. 26 So eat and drink 



a (19) The words / will give you a pure boy are the words of the message. 
The Spirit only conveyed the Divine message. Every word of the Quran is the 
word of God, but every word was delivered to the Holy Prophet by the angel. 

b (21-1) Jesus was a sign to people, in the sense that he was made a prophet, 
and every prophet is a sign, because the Divine revelation granted to him affords a 
clear proof of the existence of the Divine Being. Or, he was a sign to the Israelites 
in particular, because with him prophethood came to an end among the Israelites. 

c (21-2) She conceived him in the ordinary way in which women conceive 
children. 

d (23-1) This shows that Mary gave birth to Jesus while on a journey; hence 
the reference to water and food in v. 24 and 25, such as one can only find in a 
journey. That she was going to a distant place is shown by v. 22. She may have 
had recourse to the trunk of a palm-tree to find a support in the throes of child- 
birth. 

e (23-2) Mary gave birth to Jesus under the ordinary circumstances which 
women experience in giving birth to children. The throes of childbirth were too 
severe for her to bear, and hence she gave utterance to such words. The reference 
to the pains of childbirth clearly shows that an ordinary human child was coming 
into the world. Or, there may be a reference to Genesis 3:16, In pain you shall 
bring forth children. 

/(25) The Quran does not accept that Jesus was born on 25th December. It 
was the time when fresh ripe dates are found on palm-trees. It is now a recognized 
fact that 25th December was not Jesus' birthday. According to the birth account in 
Luke 2:8, shepherds were keeping watch over their flocks by night in the fields, 
which shows that it was not winter. The 25th of December was taken from the 
birthday of the Persian sun-god Mithra.

and be comforted. Then if you see any mortal, say: Surely I have 
vowed a fast to the Beneficent, so I will not speak to anyone

27 Then she came to her people with him, carrying him. 
They said: Mary, you have indeed brought a strange thing! e 
28 Sister of Aaron,'' jour father was not a wicked man, nor was 
your mother an unchaste woman! 29 But she pointed to him. They 
said: How should we speak to one who is a child in the cradle? e 
30 He said: I am indeed a servant of Allah. He has given me the 



a (26) It was really a kind of fast. Zacharias, as we have already seen, was 
told not to speak to people for three days. 

b (27-1) The conversation in v. 27-33 is alone sufficient to make it clear that 
this incident relates to a time when Jesus had grown up sufficiently to have been 
appointed a prophet and to have received Divine revelation. The Quran does not 
relate stories in all their details, and often omits a number of incidents which are 
not needed for its purpose. For instance, v. 1 1 relates only Zacharias' receiving 
the joyful news of a son, while v. 12 asks that son to take hold of the Book with 
strength. Jesus could only say that he was made a prophet when he was actually 
entrusted with the mission of a prophet, and not before. Moreover, it is unreason- 
able to suppose that, as soon as Mary gave birth to the child, she took it to her 
people to make a show of it. The word carrying does not show that she was carry- 
ing him in her arms; it means that he was being carried on an animal. Compare 
9:92, where some of the companions are spoken of as coming to the Prophet that 
he might carry them, and he is related as replying that he did not have that on 
which to carry them, i.e. animals. Compare Matthew 21:1-7 where the story is 
related of Jesus entering Jerusalem riding an ass, or an ass and a colt. 

c (27-2) The reference in Mary's bringing a strange thing may be to her 
having given birth to a son who claimed greater authority than the elders of Israel, 
with a deeper hint to the calumny against her, for which see 4:156. In his reply 
Jesus does not make a single reference to the circumstances of his birth. Hence 
the inference is quite reasonable that the question was directed against the mission 
of Jesus and not against the circumstances of his birth. 

d (28) The fact that Mary was devoted to the Temple from the age of three to 
twelve years shows that she belonged to the priestly class, being of the Levitical 
race. Hence she is called sister of Aaron. The word ukht, meaning sister, is by no 
means limited to the close blood-relationship. 

e (29) Old and learned Jews would no doubt speak of a young man who was 
born and brought up before their eyes as a child in the cradle, as if disdaining to 
address one so young.

Book and made me a prophet, 31 and He has made me blessed 
wherever I may be, and He has enjoined on me prayer and the due 
charity so long as I live," 32 and to be kind to my mother; and He 
has not made me insolent, unblessed. 33 And peace on me the day 
I was born, and the day I die, and the day I am raised to life. 

34 Such is Jesus son of Mary — a statement of truth about 
which they dispute. 35 It does not befit Allah that He should take to 
Himself a son. Glory be to Him! When He decrees a matter He 
only says to it, Be, and it is. 36 And surely Allah is my Lord and 
your Lord, so serve Him. This is the right path. c 37 But factions 
from among them differed; so woe to those who disbelieve, 
because of their presence on a grievous day! 38 How clearly will 
they hear and see on the day when they come to Us; but the wrong- 
doers are today in manifest error. 39 And warn them of the day of 
Regret, when the matter is decided. And they are (now) in negli- 
gence and they do not believe. 40 Surely We inherit the earth and 
those on it, and to Us they are returned. 



a (31) It is clear that this conversation did not take place when Jesus was an 
infant in the cradle, but when he had actually been made a prophet. It is absurd to 
suppose that prayers and charity were enjoined on Jesus while he was only a day 
old and that he really observed these injunctions at that age. Jesus' answer clearly 
shows that he was addressing his people after he had been entrusted with the 
mission of prophethood. 

b (32) Here only the mother is spoken of, whereas in a similar case in v. 14 
John is spoken of as being kind to both parents. This may be due to the fact that 
Joseph may not have been living at the time when Jesus spoke these words. 
Joseph was already an old man when he married Mary, and by the time that the 
ministry of Jesus begins we find no mention of him even in the Gospels, the 
mother and brothers being the only relations mentioned. Or, the mother alone is 
mentioned because the Gospels relate an incident showing that Jesus was rude to 
his mother (Matthew, 12:48), and this verse disproves the statement, it being one 
of the objects of the Quran to clear Jesus of all false charges. 

c (36) According to Matthew, when Jesus was tempted of the devil, who 
asked him to worship him, Jesus' reply was: "For it is written, You shall worship 
the Lord your God, and Him only you shall serve" (Matthew, 4: 10). 

d (39) The day of Judgment is here called the day of Regret, because man 
will then regret that he wasted the opportunity given to him to work for his own 
good. 



19 : 41 • ABRAHAM 381 

Section 3: Abraham 

41 And mention Abraham in the Book. Surely he was a truthful 
man, a prophet. 42 When he said to his sire: My sire, why do you 
worship something which does not hear, nor see, nor can it avail 
you at all? 43 My sire, to me indeed has come the knowledge which 
has not come to you; so follow me, I will guide you on a right path. 
44 My sire, do not serve the devil. Surely the devil is disobedient to 
the Beneficent. 45 My sire, surely I fear that a punishment from the 
Beneficent may afflict you, so that you become a friend of the 
devil. 

46 He said: Do you dislike my gods, Abraham? If you do not 
stop, I will certainly drive you away. And leave me for a time. 
47 He said: Peace be on you! I shall pray my Lord to forgive you. 
Surely He is ever Kind to me. 48 And I withdraw from you and 
what you call on besides Allah, and I call upon my Lord. Maybe I 
shall not remain unblessed in calling upon my Lord. 

49 So when he withdrew from them and what they worshipped 
besides Allah, We gave him Isaac and Jacob. And each (of them) 
We made a prophet. 50 And We gave them of Our mercy, and We 
granted them a truthful mention of eminence. 4 

Section 4: Other Prophets are raised 

51 And mention Moses in the Book. Surely he was one 
purified, and was a messenger, a prophet/ 52 And We called to him 



a (49) It is elsewhere made clear that Jacob was his grandson (11:71, 21:72). 
Nor should it be supposed that giving signifies only the giving of a son, for of 
Moses it is said in v. 53, We gave him his brother Aaron, a prophet, though Aaron 
was older than Moses. 

b (50) However humble a life a prophet may lead, he is granted an eminence 
among later generations, and the record of eminence of a prophet is a truthful one. 

c (51) Rasul, or messenger, means one who is sent with a message for the re- 
generation of people, while nabi, or prophet, is one who has the gift of prophecy, 
i.e., who receives a naba ' or information from on high. The elect who are chosen 
for the regeneration of man are called prophets as receiving knowledge from 
Allah, and messengers as delivering to humanity the messages they receive.

from the blessed side of the mountain, and We made him draw 
near to Us in communion. 53 And We gave him out of Our mercy 
his brother Aaron, a prophet. 54 And mention Ishmael in the Book. 
Surely he was truthful in promise, and he was a messenger, a 
prophet." 55 And he enjoined on his people prayer and charity, and 
was one in whom his Lord was well pleased. 56 And mention Idrls 
in the Book. Surely he was a truthful man, a prophet, 57 and We 
raised him to an elevated state. 

58 These are they on whom Allah bestowed favours, from 
among the prophets, of the offspring of Adam, and of those whom 
We carried with Noah, and of the offspring of Abraham and 
Israel, and of those whom We guided and chose. When the 
messages of the Beneficent were recited to them, they fell down in 
submission, weeping. 59 But after them came an evil generation, 
who wasted prayers and followed lusts, so they will meet with 
ruin, 60 except those who repent and believe and do good — such 
will enter the Garden, and they will not be wronged in the least: 
"Gardens of perpetuity which the Beneficent has promised to His 
servants, in the Unseen. Surely His promise ever comes to pass. 
62 They will hear therein no vain discourse, but only, Peace! c And 
they have their sustenance therein, morning and evening. 63 This is 
the Garden which We cause those of Our servants to inherit who 
keep their duty. 



a (54) When Abraham prayed to the Lord "that Ishmael might live before 
You", the reply was: "And as for Ishmael, I have heard you" (Genesis, 17:18, 20), 
which shows that Ishmael was made a prophet. See also 2:124-125, footnotes. 

b (57) Idrls is the same as Enoch of the Bible. The word raf, which is used 
of Jesus, is also used of Enoch, and some commentators therefore misinterpret it 
as indicating that Enoch was taken up to heaven alive. But the same mistake is 
made in both cases, for raf signifies raising to high dignity; see 3:55 footnote 2. 
The mistake seems to have arisen from what is said of Enoch in the Bible: "And 
Enoch walked with God, and he was not, for God took him" (Genesis, 5:24). 

c (62) This description of the Hereafter shows that the Muslim in this world 
talks of nothing but peace. Islam is really peace, and it is by making peace here 
with the Creator and His creatures that one can find peace hereafter. This is the 
great truth underlying the Islamic idea of paradise. The state of perfect peace 
spoken of here is called the Garden in v. 63 which the righteous will inherit.

64 And we do not descend but by the command of jour Lord. 
To Him belongs what is before us and what is behind us and what

heavens and the earth and all that is between them, so serve Him 
and be patient in His service. Do you know anyone equal to Him? 

Section 5: How the Opponents were dealt with 

66 And says man: When I am dead, shall I truly be brought 
forth alive? 67 Does not man remember that We created him before, 
when he was nothing? 68 So by your Lord! We shall certainly gather 
them together and the devils, 6 then shall We bring them around hell 
on their knees. 69 Then We shall draw forth from every group those 
most rebellious against the Beneficent. 70 Again, We certainly know 
best those who deserve most to be burned in it. 71 And there is not 
one of you but shall come to it. c This is an unavoidable decree of 
your Lord. 

72 And We shall deliver those who guard against evil, and 
leave the wrongdoers in it on their knees. 73 And when Our clear 
messages are recited to them, those who disbelieve say to those 
who believe: Which of the two groups is better in position and 
better assembled? 6 74 And how many a generation have We 



a (64) As the angels brought revelation to previous prophets (indicated in the 
words we do not descend), so they now bring revelation, by the command of the 
Lord, to the Holy Prophet Muhammad. The words, your Lord is never forgetful, 
signify that the promises and prophecies made by God through His prophets could 
not be forgotten. Thus, after an account of the previous prophets, the subject moves 
to the revelation of the Holy Prophet for the remainder of the chapter. 

b (68) The devils here are clearly those humans who lead others to evil. 

c (71) The wicked only are spoken of, as the context shows clearly. That the 
righteous will not go to hell is made clear further on: "The day when We gather 
the dutiful to the Beneficent to receive honours, and drive the guilty to hell, as 
thirsty beasts" (v. 85-86). According to 21:102, the righteous will not hear the 
faintest sound of hell. 

d (72) The word thumma, the first word of this verse, frequently means and, 
besides its meaning of then. It is wrong to suppose that the righteous will be first 
cast into hell and then delivered.

destroyed before them, who had better possessions and appearance! 
75 Say: As for him who is in error, the Beneficent will prolong his 
length of days; until they see what they were threatened with, 
either the punishment or the Hour." Then they will know who is 
worse in position and weaker in forces.* 76 And Allah increases in 
guidance those who go aright. And the ever-abiding, the good 
works, are better with your Lord in reward and yield better return. 

77 Have you seen him who disbelieves in Our messages and 
says: I shall certainly be given wealth and children? c 78 Has he 
gained knowledge of the unseen, or received a promise from the 
Beneficent? 79 By no means! We write down what he says, and We 
shall lengthen to him the length of the punishment, 80 and We shall 
inherit from him what he says, and he will come to Us alone. d 
81 And they have taken gods besides Allah, that they should be to 
them a source of strength — 82 By no means! They will soon deny 
their worshipping them, and be their adversaries. 

Section 6: False Doctrine of Sonship 

83 Do you not see that We send the devils against the disbelie- 
vers, inciting them provokingly? 84 So make no haste against them. 
We only number out to them a number (of days). 85 The day when 
We gather the dutiful to the Beneficent to receive honours, 86 and 
drive the guilty to hell, as thirsty beasts. 87 They have no power of 
intercession, except him who has made a covenant with the 
Beneficent. 



a (75-1) The Hour signifies the hour of doom, when their power will be 
utterly destroyed. In comparison with this is the lighter "punishment". 

b (75-2) In these words it is clearly indicated that the time will come when 
they will find themselves in an evil condition, and their forces weaker than the 
forces of Truth. 

c (77) They have no eye for the higher values of life; all they want is wealth 
and children or followers. 

rf(80) The reference is to his saying in v. 77: "I shall certainly be given 
wealth and children". God's inheriting thus means that their wealth and children 
will be taken away from them and ultimately be a source of strength to Islam. 



19 : 88 • FALSE DOCTRINE OF SONSHIP 385 

88 And they say: The Beneficent has taken to Himself a son. 
"'Certainly you make a detestable assertion! 90 The heavens may 
almost be torn apart at it, and the earth split, and the mountains 
crumble down in pieces, 91 that they ascribe a son to the Beneficent! 
92 And it is not worthy of the Beneficent that He should take to Him- 
self a son." 93 There is none in the heavens and the earth but comes 
to the Beneficent as a servant. 94 Certainly He comprehends them, 
and has numbered them all. 95 And everyone of them will come to 
Him on the day of Resurrection, alone. 

96 Those who believe and do good deeds, for them the Bene- 
ficent will surely bring about love.* 97 So We have made it easy in 
jour tongue, only that you should give good news by it to those who 
guard against evil, and should warn by it a contentious people. 
98 And how many a generation before them have We destroyed! 
Can you see anyone of them or hear a sound of them? 



a (92) Verses 89-93 contain a most emphatic and clear condemnation of the 
Christian doctrine of the Godhead of Jesus Christ. As this chapter belongs to about 
the fifth year of the Holy Prophet's mission, it shows that Islam had set before 
itself from the very first the grand object of the reformation of Christianity. The 
particular point on which stress is laid in this chapter, as against the fundamental 
errors of the Christian religion, Sonship and Atonement, is that God is Rahman 
(Beneficent), and does not require any compensation to forgive sinners. It is for 
this reason that the name Rahman, in preference to all other names of the Divine 
Being, is mentioned over and over again in this chapter, and the key to the whole 
position is contained in v. 92 in the words: // is not worthy of the Beneficent that 
He should take to Himself a son. In fact, the doctrine of Atonement is contradicted 
by Christ's own words in the Lord's prayer: "And forgive us our debts as we 
forgive our debtors" (Matthew, 6:12). A man is said to forgive his debtor when he 
remits the debt and does not exact any compensation. Even thus does God forgive 
sinners; He needs no compensation. 

b (96) Allah's bringing about love for the righteous means that He loves 
them Himself and inspires love for them in the hearts of other people, while they 
also love Allah as well as their fellow-beings. The righteous servants of God are 
opposed at first, but gradually their goodness prevails and they are loved and 
admired. There is a prophetic reference here to the great love with which the hearts 
of the enemies of the Prophet were to be inspired in the near future, and even 
today the hearts of people are being inspired with greater and greater love for him 
as the world witnesses the good which he did to humanity. 



Chapter 20 
Ta Ha 

The initial letters of this chapter serve as its title. Beginning by declaring 
that the Quran was revealed to be triumphant in the world, it deals at length 
with the story of Moses, showing how he was ultimately successful. It 
follows this by a description of the opposition to the Prophet Muhammad and 
the consequences of that opposition. This chapter was revealed in the early 
period at Makkah, about or before the fifth year of the Holy Prophet's 



Section 1 : Moses is called 

In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful. 

1 O man," 2 We have not revealed the Quran to you that you 
may be unsuccessful; 3 but it is a reminder to him who fears: 
4 a revelation from Him Who created the earth and the high heavens. e 
5 The Beneficent is established on the Throne of Power. 6 To Him 
belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is in the earth 
and whatever is between them and whatever is beneath the soil. 
7 And if you utter the saying aloud, surely He knows the secret 
(that you hide), and what is yet more hidden. "Allah — there is 
no God but He. His are the most beautiful names. 



a (1) Ta ha, a combination of the two letters ta and ha, is, according to 
various early commentators, a word meaning O man. It is also considered to be a 
name of the Holy Prophet. 

b (2) That is, it could not be that the Prophet, to whom the Quran was revealed, 
should remain unsuccessful in bringing about the transformation for which it was 
revealed. It is a consolation, and a clear prophecy, that a mighty transformation 
will be brought about, not only in Arabia but in the whole world, for that was the 
object which the Quran had set out to accomplish from the first. 

c (4) The Quran cannot be a failure, because it is a manifestation of the will 
of Him Who holds sway over all. 

d (7) The secret is what a man hides in his heart, and what is yet more hidden 
is what is in the subconscious mind. Both are known alike to Allah.

20 : 9 • MOSES IS CALLED 387 

9 And has the story of Moses come to .you? 10 When he saw a 
fire, he said to his family: Wait, I see a fire; maybe I will bring to 
you a live coal from it or find guidance at the fire." 11 So when he 
came to it, a voice came: O Moses, 12 surely I am your Lord, so 
take off jour shoes; surely you are in the sacred valley Tuwa. 
13 And I have chosen you so listen to what is revealed: 14 Surely I 
am Allah, there is no God but I, so serve Me, and keep up prayer 
for My remembrance. 15 Surely the Hour is coming — I am about to 
make it manifest c — so that every soul may be rewarded as it 
strives. 16 So do not let him who does not believe in it, and follows 
his low desire, turn you away from it, so that you perish. 

17 And what is this in jour right hand, O Moses? 18 He said: 
This is my staff — I lean on it, and I beat leaves with it for my 
sheep, and I have other uses for it. 19 He said: Throw it down, 
O Moses. 20 So he threw it down, and lo! it was a snake, gliding."' 



a (10) As the verses that follow show, Moses received a Divine revelation on 
this occasion, and his seeing the fire was also a part of the revelation; it was with 
the spiritual eye that he saw it. The Quran has stated elsewhere that revelation is 
received only in three ways (42:51), and in each of these the recipient is really 
given particular senses with which to feel and see things. 

b (12) The command to take off the shoes is a metaphorical expression for 
making the heart vacant from care for family and property. According to some, it 
is a command to stay (as if to say, make yourself at home). 

c (15) Ikhfa is one of the words which convey contrary significances, con- 
cealing or removing that which conceals a thing. But that here it does not mean 
concealing is made clear by the context. It is the coming of the Hour and the 
meting out of rewards and punishments that the verse deals with, which is clearly 
removing the veil or making the hour manifest. Note that the Hour does not 
necessarily signify the Resurrection; on the other hand, it very often indicates the 
doom of a people, the hour of the departure of their glory and power. 

d (20) All this was experienced by Moses in that particular state in which the 
recipient of a revelation finds himself at the time of the revelation; see 7:108 foot- 
note. What was shown to Moses on this occasion had a deeper significance; see v. 
23, where the object of showing these signs is stated to be that We may show you 
of Our greater signs. Thus the two signs mentioned here were really indications 
of something greater. The word 'asa (staff) stands metaphorically for a community. 
Hence the sight of his staff becoming a gliding serpent was shown to him as an 
indication that his community, i.e., the Israelites, who had been reduced to a state 
of slavery under Pharaoh, would soon become a living nation. 



388 20. TAHA -20:21 

21 He said: Take hold of it and do not fear. We shall return it to its 
former state. 22 And press your hand to your side, it will come out 
white without harm — another sign:" 23 that We may show you of 
Our greater signs. 24 Go to Pharaoh, surely he has exceeded the 
limits. 

Section 2: Moses and Aaron go to Pharaoh 

25 He said: My Lord, expand my breast for me (with know- 
ledge), 26 and ease my task for me, 27 and loosen the knot from my 
tongue, ' 28 (that) they may understand my word. 29 And give to me 
a helper from my family, 30 Aaron, my brother; 31 add to my strength 
by him, 32 and make him share my task — 33 so that we may glorify 
You much, 34 and much remember You. 35 Surely, You are ever 
seeing us. 

36 He said: You are indeed granted your petition, O Moses. 
37 And indeed We bestowed on you a favour at another time, 
38 when We revealed to your mother what was revealed: 39 Put him 
into a chest, then put it into the river, the river will cast it upon the 
shore — there an enemy to Me and an enemy to him shall take 
him up. And I shed on you love from Me; and that you may be 
brought up before My eyes. e 40 When your sister went and said: 
Shall I direct you to one who will take charge of him? So We 
brought you back to your mother that she might be comforted and 
she should not grieve. And you killed a man, then We delivered 
you from grief, and tried you with (many) trials. Then you stayed 
for years among the people of Midian. Then you came here as 



a (22) Bearing in mind what has been said above, this has also a deeper 
meaning. A white hand signifies an argument made very clear. The deeper signi- 
ficance in this case was that his arguments would prevail. 

b (27) By a man who has a knot in his tongue is meant a man unable to 
speak freely. 

c (39) Moses was born at a time when Pharaoh had commanded all male 
children born to the Israelites to be thrown into the Nile. Moses' mother kept him 
concealed for three months, and at last, unable to hide him any longer, cast him 
upon the river in an ark of bulrushes, whence he was picked up by Pharaoh's 
daughter (Exodus, 2:1-10).

ordained, O Moses. 41 And I have chosen you for Myself. 

42 Go you and your brother with My messages and do not be 
remiss in remembering Me. 43 Go both of you to Pharaoh, surely 
he is inordinate; 44 then speak to him a gentle word, perhaps he may 
be mindful or fear. 45 They said: Our Lord, we fear that he may 
hasten to do us harm or be inordinate. 46 He said: Do not fear, 
surely I am with you — I do hear and see. 47 So go to him and say: 
Surely we are two messengers of jour Lord, a so send forth the 
Children of Israel with us, and do not torment them. Indeed we 
have brought you a message from jour Lord, and peace be on him 
who follows the guidance. 48 It has indeed been revealed to us that 
punishment will overtake him who rejects and turns away.* 

49 (Pharaoh) said: Who is your Lord, Moses? 50 He said: Our 
Lord is He Who gives to everything its creation, then guides (it). e 
51 He said: What then is the state of the former generations? 52 He 
said: The knowledge of that is with my Lord in a book; my Lord 
neither makes error nor forgets — 53 Who made the earth for you 
an expanse and made for you paths in it and sent down water from 
the clouds. Then with that We bring forth pairs of various herbs. 
54 Eat and pasture your cattle. Surely there are signs in this for those 
who have understanding. 

Section 3: Moses and the Enchanters 

55 From it We created you, and into it We shall return you, 
and from it raise you a second time. 56 And truly We showed him 



a (47) Both Moses and Aaron were messengers (sing, rasul) of God. 

b (48) This contains a clear warning to Pharaoh of his end in case of rejec- 
tion. Moses and Aaron were directed to convey this message. The whole account 
of their actual going to Pharaoh and the delivery of this message is omitted here, 
and the next verse gives us Pharaoh's reply to their demand. 

c (50) This verse contains an argument for the necessity of Divine revelation. 
It says that, as Allah has created everything, and then given it the qualities and 
means by which it can attain to perfection — for this is the true significance of 
hadd, i.e., guides it (to its goal) — so man also stands in need of spiritual and 
moral directions for his attainment to perfection. 



390 20. TA HA • 20 : 57 

all Our signs but he rejected and refused. 57 Said he: Have you 
come to us to turn us out of our land by your enchantment, Moses? 
58 We too can bring to you enchantment like it, so make an appoint- 
ment between us and you, which we do not break, neither we nor 
you, in a central place. 59 (Moses) said: Your appointment is the 
day of the Festival, and let the people be gathered in the early 
forenoon. 

60 So Pharaoh went back and settled his plan, then came. 
61 Moses said to them: Woe to you! Do not fabricate a lie against 
Allah or He will destroy you by punishment, and he fails indeed 
who fabricates (a lie). 62 So they disputed among themselves about 
their affair and kept the talk secret. 63 They said: These are surely 
two enchanters who would drive you out from your land by their 
enchantment, and destroy your excellent institutions. 64 So settle your 
plan, then come (ranged) in ranks, and he will succeed indeed this 
day who is uppermost. 

65 They said: Moses, will you throw, or shall we be the first 
to throw? 66 He said: No, you throw down. Then lo! their cords and 
their rods — it appeared to him by their enchantment as if they 
ran. a 67 So Moses conceived fear in his mind. 68 We said: Do not 
fear, surely you are the uppermost. 69 And throw down what is in 
your right hand — it will eat up what they have produced. What 
they have produced is only the trick of an enchanter, and the 
enchanter does not succeed wherever he comes from. 70 So the en- 
chanters fell down prostrate, saying: We believe in the Lord of 
Aaron and Moses. 

71 (Pharaoh) said: You believe in him before I give you 
permission! Surely he is your chief who taught you enchantment. 
So I shall cut off your hands and your feet on opposite sides and I 
shall crucify you on the trunks of palm-trees, and you shall 
certainly know which of us can give the severer and the more 



a (66) The forces of untruth appear to carry the day for a while, but are soon 
vanquished; see v. 69. Also compare 7:1 17, where these cords and rods are des- 
cribed as their lies. 

b (67) Moses feared that people might be misled.

lasting punishment. 72 They said: We cannot prefer you to the clear 
arguments that have come to us and to Him Who made us, so 
decide whatever you will decide. Fou can only decide about this 
world's life. 73 Surely we believe in our Lord that He may forgive 
us our faults and the magic to which you compelled us. And Allah 
is Best and Ever-abiding. 74 Whoever comes guilty to his Lord, for 
him is surely hell. He will neither die in it, nor live." 75 And who- 
ever comes to Him a believer, having done good deeds, for them 
are high ranks — 76 Gardens of perpetuity, in which rivers flow, to 
abide in them. And such is the reward of him who purifies him- 
self. 

Section 4: The Israelites worship the Calf 

77 And certainly We revealed to Moses: Travel by night with 
My servants, then strike for them a dry path in the sea, not fearing 
to be caught, nor being afraid. 78 So Pharaoh followed them with 
his armies, then the sea covered them that would cover them. 
79 And Pharaoh led his people astray and he did not guide aright. 

80 O Children of Israel, We truly delivered you from your 
enemy, and made a covenant with you on the blessed side of the 
mountain, and sent to you the manna and the quails. 81 Eat of the 
good things We have provided for you, and do not exceed the 
limits in that respect, so that My wrath comes upon you; and he on 
whom My wrath comes, he perishes indeed. 82 And surely I am 
Forgiving toward him who repents and believes and does good, 
then walks aright. 

83 And what made you hasten from your people, O Moses? 
84 He said: They are here on my track, and I hastened on to You, my 
Lord, that You might be pleased. 85 He said: Surely We have tried 
your people in your absence, and the Samirl e has led them astray. 



a (74) Those in hell are not alive, because spiritually they are dead, and they 
are not dead because death would mean the cessation of their torments. 

b (77) This shows that there was at that time a dry path in the sea; see 2:50. 

c (85) The verse shows that some person other than Aaron was responsible for 
making the calf. From Rabbinical literature it appears that the Egyptians who had

86 So Moses returned to his people angry, sorrowing. He said: My 
people, did not your Lord promise you a goodly promise? Did the 
promised time, then, seem long to you, or did you wish that dis- 
pleasure from your Lord should come upon you, so that you broke 
(your) promise to me? 87 They said: We did not break the promise 
to you of our own accord, but we were made to bear the burdens 
of the ornaments of the people, then we cast them away, and thus 
did the Samirl suggest." 88 Then he brought forth for them a calf, a 
(lifeless) body, having a lowing sound,* so they said: This is your 
god and the god of Moses; but he forgot. 89 Could they not see that 
it returned no reply to them, e nor controlled any harm or benefit 
for them? 

Section 5: The End of Calf-worship 

90 And Aaron indeed had said to them before: My people, 
you are only tried by it, and surely your Lord is the Beneficent 
God, so follow me and obey my order. 91 They said: We shall not 
cease to keep to its worship until Moses returns to us. 92 (Moses) 
said: Aaron, what prevented you, when you saw them going astray, 
93 that you did not follow me? Have you, then, disobeyed my order? 
94 He said: Son of my mother, do not seize me by my beard, nor by 

come with the Israelites were foremost in demanding the making of the calf. 

a (87) The Israelites may have borrowed ornaments from the Egyptians as 
stated in Exodus 12:35, and the reference may here be to those ornaments, or the 
significance may simply be that the nomadic tribes of Israel, who were 
unaccustomed to these things, had imbibed these habits from the Egyptians, and 
now gave up those ornaments at the suggestion of the Samirl. The reply of the 
people states clearly they had not done the thing of their own accord, and hence 
the reference in the concluding words is to the suggestions cast into the minds of 
the people by the Samirl. 

b (88) It had neither a voice nor a soul, but it was only a sound produced by 
the air passing through the hollow metal of which it was made. 

c (89) The argument in this verse shows that God not only listens to prayers 
but also gives a reply to His true worshippers when they pray to Him. 

d (90) From this it is clear that not only had Aaron no part in making the 
calf, but he even enjoined his people to give up its worship. The Quran here con- 
tradicts the Bible.

my head. Surely I was afraid you would say: Fou have caused 
division among the Children of Israel and not waited for my word. 
95 (Moses) said: What was jour object, SamirT? 96 He said: I per- 
ceived what they did not perceive, so I took a handful from the 
footprints of the messenger then I threw it away. Thus did my soul 
entice me." 97 He said: Go away then! It is (the punishment) for you 
in this life to say, Do not touch (me). And surely for you is a pro- 
mise which shall not fail. And look at your god to whose worship 
you have kept. We will certainly burn it, then we will scatter it in 
the sea. 4 98 Your Lord is only Allah, there is no God but He. He 
comprehends all things in (His) knowledge. 

99 Thus We relate to you some news of what has happened 
before. And indeed We have given you a Reminder from Our- 
selves. 100 Whoever turns away from it, he will surely bear a 
burden on the day of Resurrection, 101 abiding in this (state). And 
evil will be their burden on the day of Resurrection — 102 the 
day when the trumpet is blown; and We shall gather the guilty, 
blind, c on that day, 103 consulting together secretly: You stayed 
only ten (days)/ 104 We know best what they say when the fairest 



a (96) The stories which many commentators have related under this verse 
are all baseless. The messenger is evidently Moses himself, and his footprints 
(athar) signify his sunnah, i.e., his practices and sayings, a significance to which 
all authorities agree, the word being well known in Muslim religious literature. 
The taking a handful means a small part of it. The man who made the calf thus 
asserts that he had a clearer perception of things than the Israelites, that he 
accepted the teachings of Moses only partially, and confesses that he now threw 
off even that part and made a calf for worship. 

b (97) This shows that the ashes of the calf were thrown into the sea, and the 
story of the Israelites being made to drink of water mixed with the ashes of the 
calf is not, therefore, credited by the Quran, which here again contradicts the Bible. 
The punishment given to the Samiri is that of an outcast in society, who is prohi- 
bited from having any relations with the Israelite people. 

c (102) The word zurq means blue-eyed, but may signify blind, in reference 
to the guilty being raised up blind in the Resurrection, as in v. 124.

they will have enjoyed ten centuries of great prosperity.

Section 6: The Prophet's Opponents 

105 And they ask you about the mountains. Say: My Lord will 
scatter them, as scattered dust, 106 then leave it a plain, smooth, level, 
107 on which you see no crookedness nor unevenness. 108 On that 
day they will follow the Inviter, in whom is no crookedness; and 
the voices are low before the Beneficent God, so that you hear 
nothing but a soft sound. c 109 On that day no intercession avails 
except of him whom the Beneficent allows, and whose word He is 
pleased with. 110 He knows what is before them and what is behind 
them, while they cannot encompass it in knowledge. ni And faces 
shall be humbled before the Living, the Self-subsistent. And he 
who bears wrongdoing is indeed undone. 112 And whoever does 
good works, and is a believer, has no fear of injustice nor of the 
withholding of what is (his) due. 

113 And thus have We sent it down an Arabic Quran, and 
have distinctly set forth in it some threats that they may guard 
against evil, or that it may be a reminder for them. 114 Supremely 
exalted then is Allah, the King, the Truth. And do not make haste 
with the Quran before its revelation is made complete to you, and 
say: My Lord, increase me in knowledge. 115 And certainly We 



a (104) Because a day is equal to a thousand years; see 22:47. It is the man 
who reminds them of this Divine promise who is called the fairest of them in 
course. 

b (105) The word jabal means a mountain, as well as the lord or chief of a 
people. That the latter significance is intended here is shown by the context; see in 
particular v. 108: "On that day they will follow the Inviter". Verses 106-107 are 
to be taken in the same sense: they point to the removal of all obstacles that 
hindered the advance of Truth. 

c (108) The Inviter in whom there is no crookedness is no other than the 
Holy Prophet, as is clearly stated elsewhere: "Praise be to Allah, Who revealed 
the Book to His servant, and did not allow in it any crookedness" (18:1). The 
whole verse clearly points to a time when Islam would be completely established, 
and instead of opposition the voices would be low before the Beneficent. The low- 
ness of the voice indicates submission.

in him no resolve (to disobey)." 

Section 7: The Devil's Misleading 

116 And when We said to the angels: Be submissive to Adam, 
they submitted, but not IblTs; he refused. 117 We said: O Adam, this 
is an enemy to you and to your wife; so do not let him drive you 
both out of the garden so that you are unhappy. 118 Surely it is 
granted to you that you are not hungry therein, nor naked, 119 and 
that you are not thirsty therein, nor exposed to the sun's heat.* 
120 But the devil made an evil suggestion to him; he said: O Adam, 
shall I lead you to the tree of immortality and a kingdom which does 
not decay? 121 So they both ate of it, then their evil inclinations 
became manifest to them, and they began to cover themselves 
with the leaves of the garden. And Adam disobeyed his Lord, and 
was disappointed. c 



him how the great transformation would be brought about and when the severe 
opposition which he was facing would come to an end. He is here told that he 
should not make haste with regard to what was promised in the Quran. The pro- 
cess will be gradual and meanwhile he should pray for more and more knowledge, 
for it was through knowledge that this great transformation was to be brought 
about. Even today a spiritual transformation can be brought about by spreading 
knowledge of the Quran, which is the greatest spiritual force that the world has ever 
seen, and it is only on account of being ignorant of this great spiritual force that 
the world remains in darkness. 

a (115) This makes it clear that there was no intention on Adam's part to 
disobey God's command, or no resolve to disobey. 

b (119) The garden of which a picture is given here is an earthly garden in 
which all the comforts necessary for man are made available. Allegorically it sig- 
nifies a state of contentment or rest in which there is no yearning either to good or 
to evil, being as it were a state of inertia, devoid of exertion or ambition. 

c (121) While in the picture of the garden drawn above in v. 118-119 mention 
is made of four things, the consequence of getting out of that state is only one: 
their evil inclinations or their shame becoming manifest to them. An explanation 
of this is found in 7:26, where it is said: "O children of Adam, We have indeed 
sent down to you clothing to cover your shame and (clothing) for beauty; and 
clothing that guards against evil — that is the best". Thus it is the clothing that 
guards against evil that is really spoken of here, and by the manifestation of the 
shame is meant the consciousness of having done something evil. The allegorical

122 Then his Lord chose him, so He turned to him and guided 
(him). i 23 He said: Go forth from this (state) both — all (of you) — 
some of you are enemies of others. Surely a guidance from Me 
will come to you; then whoever follows My guidance, he will not 
go astray nor be unhappy. 124 And whoever turns away from My 
Reminder, for him is surely a (spiritually) deprived life, and We 
shall raise him up blind on the day of Resurrection. a 125 He will 
say: My Lord, why have You raised me up blind, while I used to 
see? 126 He will say: Thus did Our messages come to you, but you 
neglected them. And thus are you forsaken this day. 127 And thus 
do We recompense him who is extravagant and does not believe 
in the messages of his Lord. And certainly the punishment of the 
Hereafter is severer and more lasting. 128 Is it not clear to them how 
many of the generations, in whose dwellings they go about, We 
destroyed before them? Surely there are signs in this for those who 
have understanding. 

Section 8: Punishment is Certain 

129 And if a word had not gone forth from your Lord, and a 
term been fixed, it would surely have come upon them. 130 So bear 
patiently what they say, and celebrate the praise of your Lord before 
the rising of the sun and before its setting, and glorify (Him) during 
the hours of the night and parts of the day, that you may be well 
pleased.* 131 And do not strain your eyes (with desire) at what We 

nature of what is so often related as the story of Adam is thus evident. It will be 
further seen that the remedy pointed out is of a spiritual nature, as here in v. 123- 
124 and in 2:38. This shows that the spiritual aspect of man's life and not the 
physical one is the real theme of Adam's story. 

a (124) The person who shuts his eyes to the Reminder leads a spiritually 
deprived life because he does not receive spiritual blessings. It is only a contented 
mind that brings ease and comfort to man, and contentment comes only through 
faith in God. 

b (130) The Holy Prophet, while told to bear persecutions patiently for a time, 
is also told to seek comfort in prayer. And he did find comfort in prayer under the 
severest persecutions. "The coolness of my eyes is in prayer," he is reported to 
have said (Mishkat, 25). This verse speaks of the five obligatory prayers and the 
two optional ones. Before the rising of the sun is the dawn prayer (jqjr), before its 
setting the 'asr prayer. Three prayers, the maghrib, the 'isha ' and the tahajjud 



20:132' PUNISHMENT IS CERTAIN 397 

have provided different classes of them with — the splendour of 
this world's life — that We may try them by means of it. And the 
sustenance of your Lord is better and more lasting. 132 And enjoin 
prayer on jour people, and steadily adhere to it. We do not ask from 
you a sustenance. We provide for you. And the (good) end is for 
guarding against evil. 

133 And they say: Why does he not bring us a sign from his 
Lord? Has not a clear evidence come to them of what is in the 
previous Books? a 134 And if We had destroyed them with punish- 
ment before it, they would have said: Our Lord, why did You not 
send to us a messenger, so that we might have followed Your 
messages before we met disgrace and shame? 135 Say: Everyone 
(of us) is waiting, so wait. Soon you will come to know who is the 
follower of the even path and who goes aright. 



(the last named being optional), occur during the hours of the night, while during 
parts of the day are the zuhr and the duha, the latter again being optional, being a 
short prayer in the early forenoon. 

a (133) The Quran is here called a clear evidence of what is contained in the 
previous Books, because it fulfils their prophecies and corroborates their truth. 



Chapter 21 
Ai-AnMya' The Prophets 

This chapter deals with the deliverance of the prophets, hence its title, and the 
ultimate triumph of their cause. It tells us that judgment on the opponents is 
approaching and the truth must triumph now as always. Then it draws atten- 
tion to the truth of revelation, after which it speaks of God's merciful dealing 
with people as this is how the Holy Prophet's opponents would be dealt with. 
Next, examples of a number of prophets are cited who were delivered from 
their enemies. At the end we are told that the righteous will be made to inherit 
the land. This chapter was revealed in the early period at Makkah, about or 
before the fifth year of the Holy Prophet's mission.

Section 1: Judgment approaches 

In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful. 

1 Their reckoning draws near to people, and they turn away in 
heedlessness. 2 No new Reminder comes to them from their Lord 
but they hear it while they play, 3 their hearts trifling. And they — 
the wrongdoers — counsel in secret: He is nothing but a mortal 
like yourselves; will you then yield to enchantment while you see? 
4 He said: My Lord knows (every) utterance in the heaven and the 
earth, and He is the Hearer, the Knower. 

5 Indeed, say they: Confused dreams! Rather, he has forged it! 
Rather, he is a poet! so let him bring us a sign such as the former 
(prophets) were sent (with)." 6 Not a town believed before them 



a (5) The Quraish were quite puzzled, and hostile critics of the Quran are 
still puzzled, what they could liken the Quran to. They first call it sihr, i.e., skilful 
eloquence, because, despite their opposition to it, it had an attraction for them. 
But then there are prophecies which mere eloquence cannot produce, so they call 
it confused dreams or medleys of dreams. Then they think that there is a settled 
purpose in it, by reason of its asserting the Prophet' s triumph and the discomfiture 
of his powerful enemies, so they call it an intentional forgery; and lastly, as if to 
devise one word combining all these, they call him a poet. Then they demand a 
sign like one given to the former prophets, meaning their destruction, because the 



398 



21:7" JUDGMENT APPROACHES 399 

which We destroyed: will they then believe?" 7 And We did not 
send before you any but men to whom We sent revelation; so ask 
the followers of the Reminder if you do not know. 8 Nor did We 
give them bodies not eating food, nor did they live forever.* 'Then 
We made Our promise good to them; so We delivered them and 
whom We pleased, and We destroyed the extravagant. 10 Certainly 
We have revealed to you a Book which will give you eminence. 
Do you not then understand? ° 

Section 2: Truth has always Triumphed 

11 And how many a town which was unjust did We demolish, 
and We raised up after it another people! 12 So when they felt Our 
might, lo! they began to flee from it. 13 Do not flee and return to 
the easy lives which you led, and to your dwellings, that you may 
be questioned. 14 They said: O woe to us! Surely we were unjust. 
15 And this cry of theirs did not cease till We made them cut off, 
extinct. 

16 And We did not create the heaven and the earth and all that 
is between them for sport. 17 If We had wished to take a pastime, 
We would have taken it from before Ourselves; by no means 



Quran had repeatedly called their attention to the fate of those who had rejected 
the truth before them. 

a (6) They are told in reply that persistence in wickedness and disbelief has 
always been punished with destruction. 

b (8) Thus every prophet had a mortal body needing food for its support, and 
every one of them tasted of death. Therefore Jesus also must have had a body 
which stood in need of food and must have tasted of death. The idea that he is alive 
is clearly opposed to this verse. 

c (10) Whenever the opponents demand that the threatened punishment should 
come, the reply always is that the Quran is a blessing and a mercy for them. The 
same truth is expressed here. They are told that the Quran has been revealed to 
make them a great and eminent nation in the world. Dhikr means eminence, fame, 
renown, honour as well as reminder. Also see 2:152 footnote. 

d (16) They were made to witness signs of the truth of the Prophet and they 
are now told to bear in mind that these signs were not in vain. In nature every 
cause has an effect and every end is achieved by means. Life must be taken 
seriously, not as a jest. 



400 21. THE PROPHETS - 21 : 18 

would We do (so). 18 Indeed, We hurl the Truth against falsehood, 
so it knocks out its brains, and lo! it vanishes." And woe to you for 
what you describe! 19 And to Him belongs whoever is in the hea- 
vens and the earth. And those who are with Him are not too proud 
to serve Him, nor are they weary. 20 They glorify (Him) night and 
day — they do not tire. 

21 Or have they taken gods from the earth who give life? 
22 If there were in them gods besides Allah, they would both have 
been in disorder. So glory be to Allah, the Lord of the Throne, 
being above what they describe! 23 He cannot be questioned as to 
what He does, and they will be questioned. 24 0r, have they taken 
gods besides Him? Say: Bring your proof. This is the reminder of 
those with me and the reminder of those before me.' But most of 
them do not know the Truth, so they turn away. 25 And We sent no 
messenger before you but We revealed to him that there is no God 
but Me, so serve Me. 



26 And they say: The Beneficent has taken to Himself a son. 
Glory be to Him! No, they are honoured servants — 27 They do 
not speak before He speaks, and according to His command 



a (18) Mark the deep conviction of the Prophet as to the ultimate triumph of 
Truth in the world. Truth had dawned on his mind in full resplendence. The forces 
of darkness and falsehood, which were uppermost in Arabia when these words 
were uttered, were brought to naught in his lifetime and, however powerful they 
may appear to be, they cannot even today make a stand before the onward march 
of Truth. 

b (22) There is order in the universe because one law pervades the whole of 
it, and one law clearly points to one Author and Maintainer of that law. Note that 
here Allah is spoken of as Rabb al- 'Arsh, the nourisher to perfection or Lord of 
the Throne, so that the Throne itself is sustained by God, and it is not God Who is 
sustained by the Throne. 

c (24) The great and fundamental truth of the Unity of Allah is common to 
all religions; no prophet ever taught polytheism. 

d (26) Refuting the doctrine that Jesus is the son of God, it is added that they 
are honoured servants. The words draw attention to the fact that others besides 
Jesus were spoken of as the sons of God, but that the title signified nothing more 
than that they were honoured servants, and that therefore Jesus was the son of 
God exactly in the same sense. 



21:28' TRUTH OF REVELATION 401 

they act." 28 He knows what is before them and what is behind 
them, and they do not intercede except for him whom He approves, 
and for fear of Him they tremble. 29 And whoever of them should 
say, I am a god besides Him, such a one We recompense with hell. 
Thus We reward the unjust. 

Section 3: Truth of Revelation 

30 Do not those who disbelieve see that the heavens and the 
earth were closed up, so We split them apart. And We made from 
water everything living. Will they not then believe? 31 And We 
made firm mountains in the earth in case it should quake with 
them, and We made in it wide ways that they might follow a right 
direction. 32 And We have made the heaven a guarded canopy; 



a (27) This verse affords a conclusive testimony for the sinlessness of pro- 
phets. In the first place they do not speak till Allah has spoken, i.e., they speak 
according to what He has taught them, not speaking of their own accord. And 
secondly, when they act, they act according to His commandment. Thus both their 
words and deeds are in accordance with Divine will, and therefore sin or dis- 
obedience of God cannot be attributed to them. The context shows clearly that the 
verse speaks of prophets, and not of angels. 

b (30-1) The heavens and the earth may stand here for the whole universe, or 
for the solar system in particular, which has developed out of a nebular mass, and 
the separation may refer to the starry creation or to the throwing off of the planets 
of the solar system, and the great symmetry of its arrangement and the motions of 
the various bodies. There is a reference to the orbits of the various planets further 
on in v. 33. But there may also be a deeper allusion in the closing up of the 
heavens and the earth to the cessation of Divine revelation for a time before the 
advent of the Holy Prophet, which was marked by the absence of a prophet in the 
world for six hundred years and the prevalence of corruption all over the world. 
The opening up of the heavens and the earth would in this case signify the coming 
of revelation, which brought life to the world. In physical nature too, rain opens 
up the earth. 

c (30-2) While this statement reveals a remarkable truth in the physical world, 
a truth which science has established only recently, that water is the source of all 
life, it draws attention to the equally remarkable spiritual truth that it is only by 
Divine revelation, which is again and again compared with water in the Quran, 
that life is given to a world otherwise dead in sin and corruption. 

rf(31) See 16:15 and footnote. The first part of the verse may also be transla- 
ted as We made firm mountains in the earth that they might be a source of benefit

yet they turn away from its signs." 33 And He it is Who created the 
night and the day and the sun and the moon. All float in orbits. 

34 And We did not grant living forever to any mortal before 
you. If you die, will they live forever? 35 Every soul must taste of 
death. And We test you by evil and good by way of trial. And to 
Us you are returned.* 36 And when those who disbelieve see you, 
they treat you only with mockery: Is this he who speaks of your 
gods? And they deny when the Beneficent God is mentioned/ 
37 Man is created of haste. Soon will I show you My signs, so ask 
Me not to hasten them. 38 And they say: When will this promise 
come to pass, if you are truthful? 6 39 If those who disbelieve only 
knew the time when they will not be able to ward off the fire from 
their faces, nor from their backs, and they will not be helped! 
40 Indeed, it will come to them all of a sudden and stun them, so 
they will not have the power to avert it, nor will they be given 
respite. 41 And messengers before you were indeed mocked, but that 
which they mocked at befell those of them who scoffed. 

to you. Compare 79:32-33. In the latter part there may be a deeper reference to 
the ways pointed out by prophets among every nation. 

a (32) Arabia had its spiritualists, astrologers and diviners who pretended to 
have access to the secrets of heaven; see 67:5. They are told that they cannot have 
any such access. Or, the meaning is that revelation from God (called here heaven) 
is guarded against all attacks. 

b (35) They were afflicted with small evils, and the removal of these again 
brought to them a turn of good events. All this was by way of trial; the greater 
punishment, which was to bring about the final overthrow of their power, was yet 
in store for them. 

c (36) The Arabs would not call Allah by the name al-Rahman (see also 
17:110 and 25:60); hence the Beneficent God is here spoken of in contrast with 
the idols. 

d (37) So prominent is the characteristic of haste in man that he may be said 
to have been created, as it were, of haste. 

e (38) The particular sign which they again and again demanded was that a 
destructive punishment like that which overtook former people should overtake 
them. 

/(41) The rejectors of truth have always scoffed at the idea of being punish- 
ed. This and the two preceding verses assert in the most forcible words that Truth 
will finally triumph. 



21 : 42 • ALLAH DEALS WITH PEOPLE MERCIFULLY 403 

Section 4: Allah deals with People Mercifully 

42 Say: Who guards you by night and by day from the Bene- 
ficent?" But they turn away at the mention of their Lord. 43 0r, 
have they gods who can defend them against Us? They cannot 
help themselves, nor can they be defended from Us. 44 Indeed, We 
gave provision to these and their fathers, until life was prolonged 
to them. Do they not see then that We are visiting the land, 
curtailing it of its sides? Can they then prevail? 

45 Say: I warn you only by revelation; and the deaf do not 
hear the call when they are warned. 46 And if a blast of the 
punishment of your Lord were to touch them, they would say: 
O woe to us! Surely we were unjust. 47 And We will set up a just 
balance on the day of Resurrection, so no soul will be wronged in 
the least. And if there were the weight of a grain of mustard seed, 
We will bring it. And Sufficient are We to take account. 

48 And certainly We gave Moses and Aaron the criterion and 
a light and a reminder for those who guard against evil, 49 who 
fear their Lord in secret and they are fearful of the Hour. 50 And 
this is a blessed Reminder, which We have revealed. Will you then 
deny it? 

Section 5: Abraham is delivered 

51 And certainly We gave Abraham his rectitude before, and 
We knew him well. 52 When he said to his sire and his people: 
What are these images to whose worship you are devoted? 53 They 
said: We found our fathers worshipping them. 54 He said: Certainly 
you have been, you and your fathers, in manifest error. 55 They 
said: Have you brought us the truth, or are you a jester? 56 He said: 



a (42) That is, if Allah were not Beneficent to you and guarded you, there is 
none who could guard you. Or if He, despite His beneficence, were to punish you 
because of your persistence in evil to such a degree as to call for the wrath of even 
a Beneficent Master, there would be none to guard you against that punishment. 

b (48) The criterion given to Moses was that he was delivered from the 
hands of a most powerful enemy. The last verse of the section predicts that a 
similar sign would be shown in the case of the Prophet Muhammad. 



404 21. THE PROPHETS • 21 : 57 

Indeed, your Lord is the Lord of the heavens and the earth, Who 
created them; and I am one of the bearers of witness to this. 
57 And, by Allah! I will certainly plan against your idols after you 
go away, turning your backs. 

58 So he broke them into pieces, except the chief of them, that 
perhaps they might return to it." 59 They said: Who has done this 
to our gods? Surely he is one of the wrongdoers. 60 (Some) said: 
We heard a youth, who is called Abraham, speak of them. 61 They 
said: Then bring him before the people's eyes, perhaps they may 
bear witness. 62 They said: Have you done this to our gods, Abra- 
ham? 63 He said: Surely (someone) has done it. The chief of them 
is this; so ask them, if they can speak. 64 Then they turned to 
themselves and said: Surely you yourselves are wrongdoers; 
65 then they were made to hang down their heads: c You know indeed 
that they do not speak. 66 He said: Do you then serve besides Allah 
what does you no good, nor harms you? 67 Enough of you and what 
you serve besides Allah! Have you no sense? 

68 They said: Burn him, and help your gods, if you are going 
to do (anything). 69 We said: O fire, be coolness and peace for 



a (58) The story of Abraham's breaking the idols is related in Jewish Rabbi- 
nical literature. 

b (63) These words do not mean "No, he has done it, this chief of them". 
There is a pause after the words "has done it" and the statement "the chief of them 
is this" is an independent statement. Thus the first words mean some doer has 
done it. The particle bal occurring before these words often denotes and or surely. 
The idols were taken as gods yet they were not able to help themselves. They 
were shattered to pieces, yet they could do no harm to their shatterer. Nor could 
they even tell their votaries who was responsible for this. It should be further 
noted that Abraham never tried to conceal what he had done. In fact, before brea- 
king the idols he had warned the people that he would plan against their idols; see 
v. 57. The object of sparing the chief idol was, as made clear in v. 58, that 
perhaps they might return to it. The chief was yet safe, they should have argued 
within themselves, why not pray to him to find out who broke the others. This is 
hinted at in v. 64, where they are made to confess their own wrongdoing in wor- 
shipping things which could do them no good or harm (v. 66). 

c (65) They were made to hang down their heads on account of shame, for 
their deities proved so helpless as to be unable to name even the person who did 
them injury. 



21 : 70 • ALLAH ALWAYS DELIVERS PROPHETS 405 

Abraham:" 70 And they intended a plan against him, but We made 
them the greater losers. 71 And We delivered him and Lot (direct- 
ing them) to the land which We had blessed for the nations. 72 And 
We gave him Isaac; and Jacob, a son's son. And We made (them) 
all good. 73 And We made them leaders who guided (people) by 
Our command, and We revealed to them the doing of good and 
the keeping up of prayer and the giving of charity, and Us (alone) 
they served; 74 and to Lot We gave wisdom and knowledge, and 
We delivered him from the town which committed wicked deeds. 
Surely they were an evil people, transgressors; 75 and We admitted 
him to Our mercy; surely he was from among the righteous. 

Section 6: Allah always delivers Prophets 

76 And Noah, when he cried before (this), so We answered 
him, and delivered him and his people from the great calamity. 
77 And We helped him against the people who rejected Our mess- 
ages. Surely they were an evil people, so We drowned them all. 

78 And David and Solomon, when they gave judgment con- 
cerning the field, when the people's sheep strayed into it by night, 
and We were bearers of witness to their judgment. 79 So We made 
Solomon to understand it. And to each (of them) We gave wisdom 
and knowledge. And We made the mountains, declaring (Our) glory, 
and the birds, subservient to David.* And We were the Doers. 



a (69) The fire was turned into coolness and peace for Abraham. The Quran 
does not state anywhere that Abraham was actually cast into a fire. His opponents 
had no doubt decided to burn him, as stated here, or to kill him or burn him 
(29:24). But here in v. 70 as well as in 37:98, we are told in clear words that they 
intended a plan against him, but We made them the greater losers (v. 70), or We 
brought them low (37:98). This shows that their plan was ineffective. According 
to 29:24, Allah delivered him from the fire, before being thrown into or after 
being thrown into it, it does not say. V. 71 states that the delivery was brought 
about by means of a journey to another land. It was thus a flight to another place 
like the Holy Prophet's Flight to Madinah, and in the history of Abraham there is 
a deeper reference to the history of the Prophet himself. 

b (79) Elsewhere it is stated that everything that exists in the heavens or the 
earth is made subservient to man (45:13); and on various occasions it is mentioned 
that the rivers, the sea, the sun and the moon, night and day, etc., are made 



406 21. THE PROPHETS "21:80 

80 And We taught him the making of coats of mail for you, to 
protect you in your wars; will you then be grateful? 

81 And to Solomon (We subdued) the wind blowing violent, 
pursuing its course by His command to the land which We had 
blessed, and We are ever Knower of all things. " 82 And of the 
devils there were those who dived for him and did other work 
besides that, and We kept guard over them; 83 and Job, when he 
cried to his Lord: Distress has afflicted me, and You are the most 
Merciful of those who show mercy! 84 So We responded to him 
and removed the distress he had, and We gave him (back) his 
people and more like them with them, a mercy from Us and a 
reminder to the worshippers. c 

85 And Ishmael and Idrls and Dhu-1-Kifl; all were from 

subservient to man (16:12, 16:14, 13:2, etc.). This explains the meaning of 
making mountains and birds subservient to David. A thing is said to be made 
subservient to a man when he can use it to his advantage. Note further that every- 
thing in the heavens and the earth declares the glory of Allah (17:44). But see 
34:10, where a similar statement occurs and may refer to the conquests of David. 

a (81) Solomon's fleet did him an important service, and this is what is 
meant by the wind being made subservient to Solomon. Also compare 14:32: 
"And He has made the ships subservient to you, to run their course in the sea by 
His command". 

b (82) Elsewhere we have: "And the devils, every builder and diver, and 
others fettered in chains" (38:37-38). Solomon employed foreigners, whom he 
had subdued, to do the work of divers and builders. The word shaitan (or devil) 
signifies one who is excessively proud, rebellious or audacious. See further 38:38. 

c (84) Job is again mentioned after Solomon in greater detail in 38:41^44. 
There also he is spoken of as being given his people (ahl) and more like them with 
them. There, however, we have clear indications that the distress spoken of here 
relates to some journey which he undertook in connection with his mission. As a 
result of this journey he lost, or was separated from, his people. It seems that he 
had to flee to some place of safety, and he ultimately found not only his own 
people but others like them, i.e., he had other believers in him in his place of 
refuge. The story of Job as given in the Quran is really a prophetical statement 
relating to the Prophet's own Flight from Makkah to Madinah, where he met with 
not only his Makkan followers but also believers in Madinah in about the same 
number. 

d (85) The commentators differ in identifying Dhu4-Kifl with one of the 
Biblical prophets, Zacharias, Elias, or Joshua. A more sound suggestion is that he

surely they were from among the good ones. 87 And Dhu-1-Nun, a 
when he went away in anger,* and he thought that We would not 
constrain him, e so he called out among afflictions: d There is no 
God but You, glory be to You! Surely I am a sufferer of loss. 6

do We deliver the believers. 89 And Zacharias, when he cried to his

is Ezekiel. This prophet is mentioned only once again, as here without any 
reference to his history, in 38:48. {Editor's Note: Dhu-l-Kifl may stand for Dhu-l- 
Kipl, as the letter/) is represented by /in Arabic, there being no p in the Arabic 
alphabet. Dhu-l-Kipl would mean he who belongs to Kapila, this being the name 
of the town in ancient India to which Buddha belonged. According to the clear 
teachings of the Quran, prophets and messengers of God were sent to every nation: 
'And there is not a people but a warner has gone among them" — 35:24; see also 
10:47, 4:164 and 40:78. Buddha's life and teachings, and his great following, lead 
us to infer that he was a messenger of God in Quranic terms.) 

a (87-1) Dhu-1-Nun is another name for Jonah, the Arabic equivalent of the 
latter being Yunus, by which name the prophet is mentioned in 6:86, 10:98 and 
37:139. Nun means a big fish, and Dhu-l-Nun therefore means lord of the fish. In 
a very early revelation, Jonah is spoken of as the companion of the fish (68:48). 
Both these titles seem to be taken from the incident of the fish; see 37:142. 

b (87-2) Evidently what is meant is that he was angry with his people and 
left them for another place. A prophet's being angry with God is simply unimagi- 
nable. Moreover he is spoken of here as going away, while no man could think of 
going away from the presence of the Omnipresent. He was wroth with his people 
because of their stubbornness. See also 37:140. 

c (87-3) Finding his people stubborn, he went away from them and was 
wroth with them and thought, or rather knew (zanna), that some way would be 
opened for him to bring people to guidance somewhere. These words may also 
mean: he thought We would not decree against him. 

d (87-4) Literally, darkness. Difficulty is compared to darkness because of 
the inability of a person to find his way when in difficulty, as when in darkness. 

e (87-5) The word zulm may mean anything from the slightest falling off 
from one's duty to the greatest transgression. It is used sometimes in a good sense 
when a man imposes upon himself a heavy duty to please God. Jonah is here 
spoken of as being of the zalimin (one of the sufferers of loss) in the sense of 
making himself suffer a loss by going away from his original place, or of having 
failed in doing justice to the message with which he was entrusted.

of inheritors! 90 So We responded to him and gave him John and 
made his wife fit for him. ' Surely they used to hasten in (doing) 
good deeds and called upon Us, hoping and fearing; and they were 
humble before Us. 91 And she who guarded her chastity/ so We 
breathed into her of Our inspiration, and made her and her son a 
sign for the nations. 92 Surely this your community is a single 
community, and I am your Lord, so serve Me. 93 And they split 
apart their unity: to Us will all return. 

Section 7: The Righteous will inherit the Land 

94 So whoever does good deeds and is a believer, there is no 
rejection of his effort, and We surely write (it) down for him. 
95 And it is forbidden to a town which We destroy: they shall not 
return. 6 96 Even when Gog and Magog are let loose and they sally 
forth from every elevated placed 97 And the True Promise draws 
near, then the eyes of those who disbelieve will be fixedly open: 
O woe to us! Surely we were heedless of this; indeed, we 



a (89) That is, One Who will remain after all have perished. 

b (90) By fitness is meant fitness to bear a child, because she was thought to 
be barren. 

c (91) Mary, the mother of Jesus, is meant here. Nothing is said about 
immaculate conception here. The guarding of chastity does not preclude the law- 
ful union of husband and wife. 

d (92) The basic principle of all religions taught by the prophets has been 
one and the same in all ages and all countries, that Allah is the Lord of all and He 
alone must be served. Therefore all prophets are here declared to be one comm- 
unity; they all led people to virtue through service to God. But, as the next verse 
shows, their followers broke off this unity. 

e (95) The verse reveals the great truth that those who are made to taste of 
death are not sent back into this world. 

/(96-1) The previous verse contains a prohibition against the return to life of 
those who are dead, or the rise of nations that are once destroyed. This one points 
out that even Gog and Magog, despite their predominance in the whole world, 
will follow the same law. The word hatta can mean even as well as until. 

g (96-2) For Gog and Magog, see 18:94 and footnote. The words they sally 
forth from every elevated place mean that they will take possession of every point 
of vantage and convenience, so as to dominate the whole world. See further 18:98 
and footnote.

were unjust." 98 Surely you and what you worship besides Allah 
are fuel of hell; to it you will come. "If these had been gods, 
they would not have come to it. And all will abide in it. i°°For 
them therein is groaning and in it they do not hear. e 

101 Those for whom the good (end) has already gone forth from 
Us, they will be kept far off from it — 102 They will not hear the 
faintest sound of it and they will abide in that which their souls 
desire. 6 103 The great Terror will not grieve them, and the angels 
will meet them: This is your day which you were promised. 104 The 
day when We roll up heaven like the rolling up of the scroll of 
writings. As We began the first creation, We shall reproduce it. 
A promise (binding) on Us. We shall bring it about/ 



a (97) The True Promise that draws near with the domination of Gog and 
Magog is the promise of the ultimate triumph of Truth: "He it is Who has sent His 
Messenger with guidance and the Religion of Truth that He may make it prevail 
over all religions" (9:33). This is also referred to in 18:99, after speaking of the 
great conflict of Gog and Magog, in the words then We shall gather them all to- 
gether. Thus the time when Gog and Magog overcome the whole world is also the 
time when Truth will gain ground and prevail over the whole earth. Materialism 
would first spread over the whole world, but would prove a failure. Then would 
spiritual Truth shine and people would feel that they had not only been heedless to 
it, but even unjust in trying to suppress it. 

b (98) Compare 18:100: "And We shall bring forth hell, exposed to view, on 
that day before the disbelievers". 

c (100) Those who turn a deaf ear to the Truth here shall be raised deaf in the 
life after death, and therefore they do not hear. 

d (101) This verse totally refutes the false idea that even the righteous will 
first go to hell. They will not even hear its faintest sound, as the next verse states. 

e (102) It is the bliss of communion with God which the souls of the righteous 
long for, so it is that bliss in which they shall live in the Hereafter. 

/(104) The rolling up of the heaven like a written scroll means that the old 
order will be swept away altogether, just as when a writing is finished, it is rolled 
up. This no doubt happened in Arabia at the appearance of the Holy Prophet. But 
then follows the statement: As We began the first creation, We shall reproduce it. 
The sweeping away of the old order no doubt meant that a new order would be 
created. This is the first creation referred to here — the bringing about of a new 
order at the Prophet's appearance. And then we are told that the new order will be 
reproduced again. This reproduction is in reference to what has been earlier stated 
— that Gog and Magog will dominate the whole world. The spiritual resuscitation 



410 21. THE PROPHETS '21:105 

105 And certainly We wrote in the Book after the reminder 
that My righteous servants will inherit the land." 106 Surely in this 
is a message for a people who serve (Us). 107 And We have not 
sentyou but as a mercy to the nations. 108 Say: It is only revealed 
to me that your God is one God: will you then submit? 109 But if 
they turn back, say: I have warned you in fairness, and I do not 
know whether what you are promised is near or far. 110 Surely He 
knows what is spoken openly and He knows what you hide. 
ni And I do not know if this may be a trial for you and a provision 
till a time. 112 He said: My Lord, judge with truth. And our Lord is 
the Beneficent, Whose help is sought against what you ascribe (to 
Him). 



to which Islam gave rise would thus receive a set-back by the predominance of a 
material outlook of the world through the prevalence of Gog and Magog, but this 
set-back, we are here told, would be only temporary, and a spiritual awakening 
like the first spiritual awakening would then be brought about in the whole world. 
This statement is followed by the words: A Promise binding on Us. The promise 
of the ultimate triumph of Truth in the whole world is of frequent occurrence in 
the Quran in earlier as well as in later revelation, and the temporary set-back indi- 
cated here is also frequently mentioned, and on one occasion at least it is made 
fully clear that it will be a set-back extending over a thousand years (32:5). 

a (105) The Quran had repeatedly warned the disbelievers that Islam would 
be made triumphant in the land, and the righteous servants who were made to suffer 
persecution would one day be masters of the land. But as already noted, it is of the 
whole world that the Quran is speaking and we are here told that Truth will ulti- 
mately triumph in the whole world, which would thus be inherited by the righteous. 
This is made clear in v. 107. 

b (107) While the words no doubt contain a reference to the merciful dealing 
with the Prophet's opponents, the real significance is that the Prophet's advent 
will prove a mercy not only to the Arabs by making them a foremost nation in the 
world, but to the whole of humanity. The Prophet's being a mercy to the nations 
of the world, is to show that ultimately all nations will be received into the Divine 
mercy which was manifested through him. Already the teachings of the Quran 
have not only benefited its followers, but even those who still reject its message, 
for, despite their rejection of it, they have accepted many of its principles. 



Chapter 22 
Ai-Hajj The Pilgrimage 

This chapter is called The Pilgrimage because the proclamation of pilgrimage, 
originally made by Abraham, was now repeated by the Holy Prophet and 
addressed to the whole world. It opens with the prophecy of a terrible calamity, 
which is a preliminary to the triumph of truth. Then it asserts the certainty of 
Divine help for the believers and their consequent triumph. As their triumph 
would involve the conquest of Makkah, the chapter then deals with the topics 
of the Sacred House, the pilgrimage and sacrifice. The subject of fighting is 
then introduced, requiring sacrifices to be made. Then it tells us that, despite 
opposition, the faithful would be established in the land, but as Allah's deal- 
ing with the opponents is merciful their punishment would be withheld for a 
while. At the end it declares that polytheism would be uprooted. This chapter 
was revealed in the late period at Makkah. 



Section 1 : The Judgment 

In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful. 

1 O people, keep your duty to your Lord; surely the shock of 
the Hour is a grievous thing." 2 The day you see it, every woman 
giving suck will forget her suckling and every pregnant one will 
lay down her burden, and you will see people as drunken, yet they 
will not be drunken, but the punishment of Allah will be severe. 
3 And some people dispute about Allah without knowledge, and 
follow every rebellious devil — 4 For him it is written that who- 
ever takes him for a friend, he will lead him astray and conduct 
him to the punishment of the burning Fire. 



a (1) In the Quran, al-sa 'ah or the Hour does not necessarily imply the day 
of Judgment. It often implies the time of judgment in this life, the time when the 
threatened doom overtakes a people, and this seems to be the significance here. 
Some consider that a severe shaking of the earth is meant as a sign of the approach 
of the great judgment, but even in that case it might imply any terrible calamity, 
such as a great war. 

b (3) The devil here is, as frequently in the Quran, the devil in human form.

412 22. THE PILGRIMAGE • 22 : 5 

5 O people, if you are in doubt about the Resurrection, then 
surely We created you from dust, then from a small life-germ, then 
from a clot, then from a lump of flesh, complete in make and 
incomplete, that We may make clear to you. e And We cause what 
We please to remain in the wombs till an appointed time, then We 
bring you forth as babies, then that you may attain your maturity. 
And some of you are caused to die, while some of you are brought 
back to the worst part of life, knowing nothing after having know- 
ledge. And you see the earth barren, but when We send down 
water upon it, it stirs and swells and brings forth a beautiful (growth) 
of every kind. 6 6 That is because Allah, He is the Truth, and He 
gives life to the dead, and He is Powerful over all things, 7 and the 
Hour is coming, there is no doubt about it; and Allah will raise up 
those who are in the graves. 

8 And some people dispute about Allah without knowledge, 



a (5-1) The word ba 'th (raising, or as "resurrection" here) is used in three 
senses in the Quran: (1) the raising of the dead to life according to their good or 
evil deeds on the Judgment day; (2) the raising of the spiritually dead to life by 
the prophets; and (3) the raising up of prophets by Allah for the guidance of man- 
kind. The word as used here may include the denial of all these three cases. The 
argument contained in this and the following verses is equally applicable to all, 
but it most prominently refers to the spiritual resurrection of the dead. 

b (5-2) These words explain the meaning of Adam's or man's creation from 
dust, which is frequently referred to in the Quran, for all people are here spoken 
of as being created from dust. Man's creation from dust implies the ultimate 
springing of all life from earth. 

c (5-3) The various stages through which every human child passes are 
spoken of here, showing how humble is his origin. Or, the reference may be to the 
various stages through which man has passed in his evolution to the present stage 
of perfection. Attention is thus drawn to the fact that, just as the physical evolu- 
tion of man is gradual, so is his spiritual growth and development. 

d (5-4) By the worst part of life is meant dotage and decrepitude. 

e (5-5) The stirring and swelling of the earth means its stirring and swelling 
with the growth of herbage. Compare 41:39. The illustration draws attention to the 
fact that revelation quickens dead hearts as rain quickens dead earth. 

/(7) Compare 35:22: "Surely Allah makes whom He pleases hear, and you 
cannot make those hear who are in the graves". The significance is that even the 
incorrigible will be raised to a spiritual life. 



22 : 9 • CERTAINTY OF DIVINE HELP 413 

and without guidance, and without an illuminating Book, 9 (such a 
person) turning away haughtily to lead (others) astray from the 
way of Allah. For him is disgrace in this world, and on the day of 
Resurrection We shall make him taste the punishment of burning. 
10 This is for what jour two hands have sent ahead, and Allah is 
not in the least unjust to the servants. 

Section 2: Certainty of Divine Help 

11 And some people serve Allah, (standing) on the verge," so 
if good befalls such a one he is satisfied with it, but if a trial afflicts 
him he turns back headlong. He loses this world and the Hereafter. 
That is a manifest loss. 12 He calls besides Allah on something 
which cannot harm him, nor benefit him; that is straying far. 13 He 
calls on him whose harm is nearer than his benefit. Certainly an 
evil guardian and an evil associate! 

14 Surely Allah will make those who believe and do good 
deeds enter Gardens in which rivers flow. Allah indeed does what 
He pleases. 15 Whoever thinks that Allah will not assist him in this 
life and the Hereafter, let him raise (himself) by some means to 
the heaven, then let him cut (it) off, then let him see if his plan 
will take away what he is enraged at.* 16 And thus have We 
revealed it, clear arguments, and Allah guides whom He will. 
17 Those who believe and those who are Jews and the Sabians and 
the Christians and the Magians and those who set up partners 
(with Allah) — surely Allah will decide between them on the day 



a (11) This expression indicates the attitude of a man who wavers, being ready 
to quit the faith on any pretence. 

b (15) The prophecies of the final triumph of the Truth and of the coming of 
Divine assistance to the Holy Prophet were repeatedly declared in the Quran, and 
the disbelievers were enraged at this. They are told that the Divine assistance must 
come, and that they should leave no stone unturned in their struggle against it, 
insomuch that, if they could, they should rise to heaven and cut off all heavenly or 
Divine assistance from the Prophet. Or, the meaning may be that they may carry 
their anger to the greatest possible extreme and be driven to the utmost desperation, 
yet they will be unable to stop the coming of Divine help to the Prophet. 



414 22. THE PILGRIMAGE • 22 : 18 

of Resurrection. Surely Allah is Witness over all things." 

18 Do you not see that to Allah makes submission whoever is 
in the heavens and whoever is in the earth, and the sun and the moon 
and the stars, and the mountains and the trees, and the animals and 
many of the people? And many there are to whom punishment is 
due. And he whom Allah disgraces, none can give him honour. 
Surely Allah does what He pleases. 

19 These are two adversaries who dispute about their Lord. 
So those who disbelieve, for them are cut out garments of fire. 
Boiling water will be poured out over their heads. 20 With it will be 
melted what is in their bellies and (their) skins as well. 21 And for 
them are whips of iron. 22 Whenever they desire to go out from it, 
from grief, they are turned back into it, and (it is said): Taste the 
punishment of burning. 

Section 3: Believers are Triumphant 

23 Surely Allah will make those who believe and do good deeds 
enter Gardens in which rivers flow — they are adorned therein 
with bracelets of gold and (with) pearls. And their garments 
therein are of silk. e 24 And they are guided to pure words, and they 
are guided to the path of the Praised One. 25 Those who disbelieve 
and hinder (people) from Allah's way and from the Sacred Mosque, 



a (17) It is implied that differences in religious beliefs do not call for punish- 
ment in this life; these will be decided on the day of Judgment. Punishment in this 
life is brought upon those who work mischief and transgress all limits in doing 
evil. 

b (22) Min ghamm-in ("from grief") explains min-ha ("from it"), and thus 
explains the nature of the punishment in this and the previous verse. It is a grief 
which will constantly burn their souls so as to melt them. 

c (23) The following incident, mentioned by Baihaqi, shows that the compa- 
nions of the Prophet understood these prophecies in another sense too: "The 
bracelets of Kisra, the Persian monarch, were brought to Umar, and he made 
Suraqa ibn Malik to wear them, on which he praised the Almighty". The reason 
for Umar making Suraqa wear the bracelets is also given by the same authority in 
another report, according to which the Holy Prophet had said to Suraqa: "How 
will you feel when you wear the bracelets of Kisra?" 



22:26- PILGRIMAGE 415 

which We have made equally for all people, (for) the dweller in 
it and the visitor." And whoever inclines to wrong in it, unjustly, 
We shall make him taste of painful punishment. 

Section 4: Pilgrimage 

26 And when We pointed to Abraham the place of the House, 
saying: Do not set up any partner with Me, and purify My House 
for those who make circuits and stand to pray and bow and pros- 
trate themselves. 27 And proclaim to mankind the Pilgrimage: 6 they 
will come to you on foot and on every lean camel, coming from 
every remote path, c 28 that they may witness benefits (provided) for 
them, and mention the name of Allah on appointed days over the 
cattle quadrupeds that He has given them; then eat of them and 
feed the distressed one, the needy. 29 Then let them accomplish 
their needful acts of cleansing, and let them fulfil their vows and 
go round the Ancient House. 2 



a (25) The two may respectively signify the dweller in Makkah and the 
dweller in the desert, or one who dwells in it constantly and one who comes to it 
occasionally. The disbelievers, being then in possession of the Sacred Mosque, 
prevented Muslims from using it. They are told that this state of things will be 
brought to an end, for it must be open to all visitors, and that could only be 
brought about by Muslims being made masters of it. 

b (27-1) The words are addressed to the Holy Prophet, and contain a mighty 
prophecy that Makkah will become the centre to which people will come for pil- 
grimage. It was announced just at the time when the Holy Prophet was being 
driven away from Makkah by his enemies. Just when Makkah seemed to have lost 
every chance of becoming a Muslim centre, and when Muslims themselves were 
in danger of being entirely destroyed, a mighty prophecy is announced in the most 
forcible words that Islam will spread to all countries of the world, and Makkah 
will become the universal centre to which pilgrims from all nations will come. 

c (27-2) The lean camel is particularly mentioned here to indicate the great 
distances from which pilgrims would come. The addition of the words from every 
remote path shows that people will come from the remotest parts of the earth. 

d (28) The subject of sacrifice is one that is specially related to the pilgri- 
mage, because every pilgrim must sacrifice an animal. Thus it is the lesson of 
sacrifice that is taught in pilgrimage. The act of the pilgrim finds an echo through- 
out the Muslim world, for every Muslim who can afford is required to sacrifice an 
animal on this occasion, and this subject is discussed in the next section. 

e (29) The mention of the Ka'bah as the Ancient House, here and in v. 33, 



416 22. THE PILGRIMAGE • 22 : 30 

30 That (shall be so). And whoever respects the sacred ordi- 
nances of Allah, it is good for him with his Lord. And the cattle 
are made lawful for you, except what is recited to you, so shun the 
filth of the idols and shun false words, 31 being upright for Allah, 
not setting up partners with Him. And whoever sets up partners 
with Allah, it is as if he had fallen from on high, then the birds had 
snatched him away, or the wind had carried him off to a distant 
place. 32 That (shall be so). And whoever respects the ordinances 
of Allah, this is surely from the piety of hearts. 33 In them are bene- 
fits for you for a term appointed, then their place of sacrifice is the 
Ancient House. 

Section 5: Sacrifices 

34 And for every nation We appointed acts of devotion that 
they might mention the name of Allah on the cattle quadrupeds that 
He has given them. So your God is One God, therefore to Him 
should you submit." And give good news to the humble, 35 whose 
hearts tremble when Allah is mentioned, and who are patient in 
their afflictions, and who keep up prayer, and spend (on good 
works) out of what We have given them. 6 



shows that it is so old that it came to be known throughout Arabia by that name, 
thus pointing to its very remote antiquity; see 2:125. 

a (34) The principle of sacrifice is one which is accepted in one form or 
another by all nations of the world; but it has a deeper meaning in Islam. The out- 
ward act is still there but it no more conveys the meaning attached to it in ancient 
religions, viz., that of appeasing an offended Deity, or that of serving as an atone- 
ment for sins. It signifies the sacrifice of the sacrificer himself, and becomes thus 
an outward symbol of his readiness to lay down his life, if required, and to sacrifice 
all his interests and desires in the cause of Truth. Hence it is that words intro- 
ducing the subject of sacrifice are immediately followed by an injunction to submit 
oneself entirely to Allah, Who is the one God, i.e., the only Being Who deserves 
to be made the true object of one's love. 

b (35) It is by the mention of Allah's name that an animal is sacrificed, and 
the meaning underlying it is that their own hearts should tremble at the mention of 
that name. Thus they should bear in mind, when sacrificing an animal over which 
they hold control, how much more necessary it is that they should lay down their 
lives in the way of Allah, Who holds control over all. Hence a verse speaking of 
sacrifices is immediately followed by one which requires the exercise of great 
patience and endurance under hard trials by the faithful. 



22:36- PILGRIMAGE 417 

36 And the camels, We have made them from among the signs 
appointed by Allah for you " — in them there is much good for you. 
So mention the name of Allah on them standing in a row. Then 
when they fall down on their sides, eat of them and feed the con- 
tented one and the beggar. Thus have We made them subservient 
to you that you may be grateful. 37 Not their flesh, nor their blood, 
reaches Allah, but to Him is acceptable the observance of duty on 
your part. c Thus has He made them subservient to you, that you 
may magnify Allah for guiding you aright. And give good news to 
those who do good (to others). 38 Surely Allah defends those who 
believe. Surely Allah does not love anyone who is unfaithful, 
ungrateful. 

Section 6: Believers permitted to fight 

39 Permission (to fight) is given to those on whom war is made, 
because they are oppressed. And surely Allah is Able to assist 
them 6 — 40 Those who are driven from their homes without a just 



a (36-1) The camels which are brought for sacrifice to Makkah by the pil- 
grims are here stated to be only outward signs of the true religion of Allah, that 
religion being no other than the religion of entire submission to Allah and of lay- 
ing down all one has, even one's life, in the way of Allah. 

b (36-2) The flesh of the animals sacrificed is not to be wasted, but it should 
serve as food for the poor and the needy. 

c (37) It is not the outward act of sacrifice which is acceptable, but the deep 
meaning of sacrifice which underlies it. The idea of atonement is quite foreign to 
Islamic sacrifice. It is the righteous whom Islam requires to sacrifice, as hinted at 
in the words: to Him is acceptable the observance of duty on your part. 

d (38) A new subject is now introduced, the subject of fighting in the way of 
Allah. This sheds light upon the connection which exists between the two sub- 
jects. After dealing with the subject of sacrifice theoretically, the Muslim has in 
fact been prepared to bring into practice the theory of the sacrifice. Hence he is 
told that the time is near when he will be required to lay down his very life in the 
defence of Truth, which the opponents were striving to exterminate. Therefore, 
the subject of fighting in the cause of Truth is a fitting sequel to the subject of 
sacrifice, as casting further light upon the inner meaning of sacrifice, and also 
requiring that doctrine to be carried into practice. 

e (39) This is the earliest permission given to the Muslims to fight. The 
words in which the permission is granted show clearly that war was first made on

cause except that they say: Our Lord is Allah. And if Allah did not 
repel some people by others, surely cloisters and churches and syna- 
gogues, and mosques in which Allah's name is much remembered, 
would have been pulled down. And surely Allah will help him 
who helps Him. Surely Allah is Strong, Mighty." 41 Those who, if 
We establish them in the land, will keep up prayer and give the 
due charity and enjoin good and forbid evil. And Allah's is the 
end of (all) affairs. 

42 And if they reject you, already before them did the people 
of Noah and Ad and Thamud reject (prophets), 43 and the people of 
Abraham and the people of Lot, 44 and the dwellers of Midian. And 
Moses (too) was rejected. But I gave respite to the disbelievers, 
then I seized them; so how (severe) was My disapproval! 45 How 
many a town We destroyed while it was unjust, so it is fallen 
down upon its roofs; and (how many) a deserted well and palace 
raised high! 46 Have they not travelled in the land so that they 
should have hearts with which to understand, or ears with which 
to hear? For surely it is not the eyes that are blind, but blind are 
the hearts which are in the breasts.* 47 And they ask you to hasten 
on the punishment, and Allah by no means fails in His promise. 
And surely a day with your Lord is like a thousand years as you 

the Muslims by their opponents; and secondly, that the Muslims had already 
suffered great oppression at the hands of their persecutors. The words of the next 
verse, those who are driven from their homes, may refer to the emigration to 
Abyssinia, or to the exodus to Madinah, which commenced soon afterwards. 

a (40) The religious freedom established by Islam has not yet been surpassed 
by the most civilized and tolerant of nations. It deserves to be noted that the lives 
of Muslims are to be sacrificed not only to stop their own persecution by their 
opponents and to save their own mosques, but to save churches, synagogues and 
cloisters as well — in fact, to establish perfect religious freedom. Mosques, though 
they are the places where the name of Allah is remembered most of all, are 
mentioned after churches and synagogues. Early Muslims closely followed these 
directions, and every commander of an army had express orders to respect all 
houses of worship, and even the cloisters of monks, along with their inmates. 

b (46) The Quran very often speaks of the blind, the deaf and the dead, 
meaning thereby the spiritually blind, deaf and dead, as it has plainly stated here.

count." 48 And how many a town to which I gave respite while it 
was unjust, then I seized it! And to Me is the return. 

Section 7: Opposition to the Prophet 

49 Say: O people, I am only a plain warner to you. 50 So those 
who believe and do good, for them is forgiveness and an honour- 
able sustenance. 51 And those who strive to oppose Our messages, 
they are the inmates of the flaming Fire. 

52 And We never sent a messenger or a prophet before you 
but when he desired, the devil made a suggestion in regard to his

lish His messages. And Allah is Knowing, Wise — 53 that He 
may make what the devil casts a trial for those in whose hearts is a 
disease and the hard-hearted. c And surely the wrongdoers are in 
severe opposition, 54 and that those who have been given know- 
ledge may know that it is the Truth from your Lord, so they should 
believe in it that their hearts may be lowly before Him. And surely 
Allah is the Guide of those who believe, into a right path. 

55 And those who disbelieve will not cease to be in doubt 
concerning it, until the Hour overtakes them suddenly, or the 



a (47) Those spoken of here are undoubtedly the opponents of Truth who were 
to come later, and who have been allowed to oppose the advance of Islam for a 
thousand years. The set-back which Islam was to receive for a thousand years is 
again spoken of in 32:5. 

b (52) A false story is mentioned in connection with this verse, according to 
which the Holy Prophet on one occasion recognized that the idols worshipped by 
the Arabs could intercede with God on their behalf. See 53:21 footnote. This story 
has been rejected by all sound and reliable commentators. The words of this verse 
do not, and cannot, mean that when a prophet recites a revelation, the devil intro- 
duces his own words into his recitation. What every prophet desires is the estab- 
lishing of the Truth that is revealed to him, and it is with this desire of every 
prophet that the devil interferes, instigating people, making suggestions to them, 
as stated here, to oppose the Truth. That this is the true meaning is also shown by 
the context, which deals with the establishing of the Truth and the desire of the 
opponents of Truth to annihilate it. 

c (53) The devil's strivings against the Prophet become a trial for the weak, 
who are unable to endure the severe persecutions of their enemies.

punishment of a destructive day comes to them. 56 The kingdom on 
that day is Allah's. He will judge between them. So those who 
believe and do good will be in Gardens of bliss. 57 And those who 
disbelieve and reject Our messages, for them is a humiliating 
punishment. 

Section 8: The Faithful shall be established 

58 And those who flee in Allah's way and are then slain or die, 
Allah will certainly grant them a goodly sustenance." And surely 
Allah is the Best of providers. 59 He will certainly make them enter 
a place which they are pleased with. And surely Allah is Knowing, 
Forbearing. 60 That (is so). And whoever retaliates with the like of 
what he is afflicted with, and he is oppressed, Allah will certainly 
help him. Surely Allah is Pardoning, Forgiving. 61 That is because 
Allah makes the night to pass into the day and makes the day to 
pass into the night, and because Allah is Hearing, Seeing/ 62 That 
is because Allah is the Truth, and what they call upon besides Him 
— that is the falsehood, and because Allah — He is the High, the 
Great. 

63 Do you not see that Allah sends down water from the 
cloud, then the earth becomes green? Surely Allah is Knower of 



a (58) A flight of the faithful to Abyssinia had already taken place, and on 
the occasion of the flight to Madinah the Holy Prophet, with Abu Bakr and Ali, 
were the last men to depart from Makkah. A true and generous leader of men, he 
waited to see his faithful followers depart before he left, so that their safety might 
be ensured. If he had left his followers behind him, they would have encountered a 
very hard fate at the hands of an exasperated enemy. The reference to some being 
slain after their flight is clearly prophetical. 

b (60) This verse permits Muslims, who were long persecuted and oppressed, 
to punish their persecutors, but at the same time recommends pardon and forgive- 
ness by referring to those two attributes of the Divine Being in the concluding 
words of the verse. 

c (61) Apparently the succession of the day and the night refers here to the 
turn of fortune hinted at in the previous verse, because an oppressed community 
could not punish its persecutors unless it gained mastery over them. The same is 
indicated in the two attributes of the Divine Being with which the verse is closed. 
The verses that follow contain hints to the same effect.

subtleties, Aware. 64 To Him belongs whatever is in the heavens 
and whatever is in the earth. And surely Allah — He is the Self- 
Sufficient, the Praised. 

Section 9: Divine Mercy in dealing with People 

65 Do you not see that Allah has made subservient to you all 
that is in the earth, and the ships gliding in the sea by His 
command? And He withholds the heaven from falling on the earth 
except with His permission. Surely Allah is Compassionate, Merci- 
ful to mankind." 66 And He it is Who brings you to life, then He 
causes you to die, then He will bring you to life. Surely man is 
ungrateful. 

67 To every nation We appointed acts of devotion, which they 
observe,* so do not let them dispute with you in the matter, and 
call (them) to jour Lord. Surely you are on a right guidance. 68 And 
if they argue with you, say: Allah best knows what you do. 69 Allah 
will judge between you on the day of Resurrection in that in which 
you differ. 70 Do you not know that Allah knows what is in the 
heaven and the earth? Surely this is in a book. That is surely easy 
to Allah. 

71 And they serve besides Allah that for which He has not 
sent any authority, and of which they have no knowledge. And for 
the unjust there is no helper. 72 And when Our clear messages are 
recited to them, you will notice a denial on the faces of those who 
disbelieve — they almost attack those who recite to them Our 
messages. Say: Shall I inform you of what is worse than this? The 
Fire. Allah has promised it to those who disbelieve. And evil is the 
destination. 



a (65) The first part of the verse gives a promise of victory to the Muslims, 
while the latter part warns the opponents that Allah withholds the punishment from 
them for a time, for He is Compassionate and Merciful to people. The withholding 
of the heaven means the withholding of the punishment, which the opponents were 
told would come down upon them from heaven. 

b (67) The principle that all nations were given spiritual light is reiterated 
throughout the Quran.

Section 10: Polytheism will be uprooted 

73 O people, a parable is set forth, so listen to it. Surely those 
whom you call upon besides Allah cannot create a fly, though they 
should all gather for it. And if the fly carry off anything from them, 
they cannot take it back from it. Weak are (both) the invoker and 
the invoked." 74 They do not estimate Allah with His due estima- 
tion. Surely Allah is Strong, Mighty. 75 AUah chooses messengers 
from angels and from mankind. Surely Allah is Hearing, Seeing. 
76 He knows what is before them and what is behind them. And to 
Allah are all affairs returned. 

77 O you who believe, bow down and prostrate yourselves and 
serve your Lord, and do good that you may succeed. 78 And strive 
hard for Allah with due striving. He has chosen you and has not 
laid upon you any hardship in religion — the faith of your father 
Abraham. He named you Muslims before and in this,* that the 
Messenger may be a bearer of witness to you, and you may be 
bearers of witness to the people; c so keep up prayer and give the 
due charity and hold fast to Allah. He is your Protector; excellent 
the Protector and excellent the Helper! 



a (73) The verse, while truly describing the inability of false gods to create the 
lowest form of life or to exercise the least control over creation, contains a clear 
prophecy that the false deities will be removed from the Sacred House, and that 
both the worshippers and the worshipped will be helpless. 

b (78-1) The reference in before is to the revelation of Abraham, who prayed 
that from among his descendants there should arise a nation of Muslims (2:128), 
and in this to the Quran. The root- word of Islam and Muslim is salm or silm, both 
signifying peace, and a Muslim is therefore one who leads a life of peace, peace 
with God, which means complete submission to His will, and peace with man, 
which means that he causes no injury to any person, as a saying of the Holy 
Prophet has it (Bukhari, 2:3). 

c (78-2) Compare 2:143, where similar words are used. The significance is 
that the Muslim community is destined to play the role of leader to the whole of 
humanity. 



Chapter 23 
Ai-Mu'minun The Belie vers 

This chapter is so named because it deals with the success of the Believers. 
Continuing the subject-matter of the last chapter, it first asserts the success of 
the believers and then refers to similar success in case of the former prophets, 
whose history, it tells us, will be repeated in the Holy Prophet's case. It ends 
with a condemnation of polytheism by its own votaries and shows how the 
wicked will finally regret their evil deeds. This chapter was revealed in the 
late period at Makkah. 



!"! 



Section 1: Success of the Faithful 

In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful. 

2? 1 Successful indeed are the believers, 2 who are humble in their 

prayers, 3 and who shun what is vain, 4 and who act for the sake of 
purity, a 5 and who restrain their sexual passions — 6 except in the 
presence of their spouses or those whom their right hands possess, 
for such surely are not to be blamed, e 7 but whoever seeks to go 



a (4) The words li-l-zakat mean for the sake of purity or to attain purity . The 
word zakat means originally purity, as in 19:13, while zakat in the sense of due 
charity is spoken of as being paid or given. 

b (5) This expression, lit. guard their private parts, means the restraining of 
sexual passions. 

c (6) The words ma malakat aimanu-hum, literally "those whom their right 
hands possess", usually indicate slaves. It should be noted that this chapter was 
revealed at Makkah, and the conditions under which slave-girls could be taken as 
wives were given later at Madinah; see 4:25. If the reference here is to sexual rela- 
tions, the permission regarding those whom their right hands possess must be read 
subject to the conditions of 4:25. It may, however, be added that the expression 
used in v. 5 means in a wider sense the covering of parts of the body which it is 
indecent to expose, and in this connection it must be borne in mind that, according 
to Islamic rules of decency, the exposure of such parts of the body, as are 
generally exposed at evening entertainment venues, is disallowed, but a certain 
degree of freedom is allowed to women in the presence of their husbands and 
female servants and to men in the presence of their wives and male servants.

beyond that, these are the transgressors — 8 and those who are 
faithful to their trusts and their covenant, 9 and those who keep a 
guard on their prayers. 10 These are the heirs, n who inherit Para- 
dise. In it they will abide. 

12 And certainly We create man of an extract of clay , a 13 then 
We make him a small life-germ in a firm resting-place, 14 then We 
make the life-germ a clot, then We make the clot a lump of flesh, 
then We make (in) the lump of flesh bones, then We clothe the 
bones with flesh, then We cause it to grow into another creation. 
So blessed be Allah, the Best of creators! 15 Then after that you 
certainly die. 16 Then on the day of Resurrection you will surely be 
raised up. 

17 And indeed We have made above you seven ways — and 
never are We heedless of creation. c 18 And We send down water 
from the cloud according to a measure, then We cause it to settle 
in the earth, and We are indeed Able to carry it away. 19 Then with 
it We cause to grow gardens of palm-trees and grapes for you. 
You have therein many fruits, of which you eat; 20 and a tree that 
grows out of Mount Sinai, which produces oil and relish for 



a (12) The creation of man is here traced back to earth, for the life-germ in 
sperma is an extract of food, which is drawn from earth in whatever form it may 
be. While the first eleven verses speak of the spiritual growth of man, his physical 
growth is here spoken of, and thus a comparison may be established between the 
physical and the spiritual growth. Though described in the past tense, it is a gene- 
ral law of the creation of man that is spoken of here. The addition of the words, 
then We cause it to grow into another creation (v. 14), is to show that man's 
creation does not end with the completion of the different stages of physical 
growth, as in the case of other animals, but he is endowed with certain other 
faculties — the reference being to the moral and spiritual side of man's growth. 

b (14) The several stages in the growth of the human child, as given here, 
and unknown then, are quite in accordance with scientific investigation. It should 
be borne in mind that the word fa, meaning then, as used in then We clothe the 
bones... does not always imply order. This is clear from the context, which states 
that there is first a lump of flesh, and the nucleus of the bones is generated in this 
flesh. 

c (17) Instead of the seven heavens, here we have the seven ways, which may 
be the orbits of the seven members of the solar system, excluding the earth, as 
shown by the words above you.

make you to drink of what is in their bellies, and you have in them 
many advantages and of them you eat, 22 and on them and on the 
ships you are borne. 

Section 2: Noah 

23 And certainly We sent Noah to his people, so he said: My 
people, serve Allah, you have no God other than Him. Will you 
not guard against evil? 24 But the chiefs of those who disbelieved 
from among his people said: He is only a mortal like you, who 
desires to have superiority over you. And if Allah had pleased, He 
could have sent down angels. We have not heard of this among 
our forefathers. 25 He is only a madman, so bear with him for a 
time. 

26 He said: My Lord, help me against their calling me a liar. 
27 So We revealed to him: Make the ark under Our eyes and 
according to Our revelation; then when Our command comes, and 
water gushes forth from the valley, take into it two of all things, a 
pair,* and your own people, except those among them against 
whom the word has gone forth, and do not speak to Me in respect 
of those who are unjust; surely they will be drowned. 28 Then when 
you are firmly seated, you and those with you, in the ark, say: 
Praise be to Allah, Who delivered us from the unjust people! 
29 And say: My Lord, cause me to land a blessed landing and You 
are the Best of those who bring to land. 

30 Surely there are signs in this, and surely We are ever trying 
(people). 31 Then We raised after them another generation. 32 So 
We sent among them a messenger from among them, saying: 
Serve Allah — you have no God other than Him. Will you not 
guard against evil? 



a (20) In the tree that grows out of Mount Sinai, and which produces oil, 
there seems to be reference to the blessed olive tree of 24:35, as representing the 
Muslim nation.

Section 3: Prophets after Noah 

33 And the chiefs of his people who disbelieved and called 
the meeting of the Hereafter a lie, and whom We had given plenty 
to enjoy in this world's life, said: He is only a mortal like you, eat- 
ing what you eat and drinking what you drink." 34 And if you obey 
a mortal like yourselves, then surely you are losers. 35 Does he 
promise you that, when you are dead and become dust and bones, 
you will then be brought forth? 36 Far, very far, is what you are 
promised: 37 There is nothing but our life in this world, we die and 
we live and we shall not be raised again; 38 he is only a man who 
has forged a lie about Allah, and we are not going to believe in 
him. 

39 He said: My Lord, help me against their calling me a liar. 
40 He said: In a little while they will certainly be repenting. 41 So 
the punishment overtook them in justice, and We made them as 
rubbish; so away with the unjust people! 

42 Then We raised after them other generations. 43 No people 
can hasten on their doom, nor postpone it. 44 Then We sent Our 
messengers one after another. Whenever its messenger came to a 
people, they called him a liar, so We made them follow one 
another and We made them stories. So away with a people who do 
not believe! 

45 Then We sent Moses and his brother Aaron with Our 
messages and a clear authority 46 to Pharaoh and his chiefs, but 
they behaved haughtily and they were an insolent people. 47 So they 



a (33) The prophets are rejected because they are subject to the same laws of 
nature in their human requirements as other people. And no one can be a model 
for humans, who is not himself a human being, and who is not subject to the same 
laws of nature, for only a human being can show people how they can avoid fall- 
ing a prey to the frailties of human nature. Hence, a Divine incarnation, or God in 
a human body, cannot serve as a model to human beings. We want a mortal to show 
us how to avoid the pitfalls with which we, as mortals, are surrounded; if God 
Himself comes into the world, He cannot serve this purpose. 

b (44) The significance of making them stories is that the stories of their evil 
fate were the only remembrance of them left when they perished. 



23 : 48 • HIGHER VALUES OF LIFE 427 

said: Shall we believe in two mortals like ourselves while their 
people serve us? 48 So they rejected them and became of those who 
were destroyed. 49 And certainly We gave Moses the Book that 
they might go aright. 50 And We made the son of Mary and his 
mother a sign, and We gave them refuge on a lofty ground having 
meadows and springs." 

Section 4: Higher Values of Life 

51 O messengers, eat of the good things and do good. Surely I 
am Knower of what you do. 52 And surely this your community is 
one community, and I am your Lord, so keep your duty to Me. 
53 But they split apart their unity into sects, each faction rejoicing 
in what it had. 54 So leave them in their ignorance till a time. 55 Do 
they think that by the wealth and children with which We aid them, 
56 we are hastening to them good things? Rather, they do not 
perceive. 

57 Surely they who live in awe for fear of their Lord, 58 and 
those who believe in the messages of their Lord, 59 and those who 
set up no partner with their Lord, 60 and those who give what they 
give while their hearts are full of fear that to their Lord they must 
return — 61 These hasten to good things and they are foremost in 
attaining them. 



a (50) This description of the land applies exactly to the valley of Kashmir, 
and part of the lost ten tribes of Israel is traced to Kashmir, where a large number 
of places bear the names of places in Palestine. There is also a tomb known as the 
tomb of Nabi (i.e., the prophet), or 'Isa (i.e., Jesus), or a man by the name of Yilz 
Asaf, in Srinagar, the capital of Kashmir. The fact that the chapter deals with the 
final triumph of prophets and their deliverance from the hands of their enemies also 
gives us a clue to the mystery attending the circumstances of the disappearance of 
Jesus after the event of the Cross; for, as shown in 4:157 footnote, Jesus did not 
die on the cross. This verse indicates that, being delivered from the hands of his 
enemies, he was given shelter at some other place which, from its description here 
and other evidence, seems to be Kashmir. Traditions about Yuz Asaf lead us to 
identify him with Jesus, and to conclude that Jesus went to Kashmir after the event 
of the crucifixion, and that he preached, lived, died and was buried there. 
(Editor's Note: Since this footnote was written, much research has been published 
supporting this theory. For details, Khwaja Nazir Ahmad's work, Jesus in Heaven 
on Earth, first published in 1952, as well as a number of later publications, some 
of them by Western authors, should be consulted.)

62 And We do not impose on any soul a duty beyond its 
ability, and with Us is a book which speaks the truth, and they are 
not wronged. 63 But their hearts are in ignorance about it, and they 
have besides this other deeds which they do. 64 Until, when We 
seize those who lead easy lives among them with punishment, 
then they cry for help. 65 Do not cry for help this day. Surely you 
will not be helped by Us. 66 My messages were indeed recited to 
you, but you used to turn back on your heels 67 haughtily, passing 
nights in talking nonsense about it. 68 Do they not then ponder the 
Word? Or has there come to them something which did not come 
to their fathers of old? 69 0r do they not recognize their Messenger, 
that they deny him? 70 Or say they: There is madness in him? But 
he has brought them the Truth, and most of them hate the Truth. 
71 And if the Truth follow their desires, the heavens and the earth 
and all those who are in them would perish. Indeed, We have 
brought them their reminder, but they turn away from their 
reminder. 72 0r do you ask them a recompense? But the recom- 
pense of your Lord is best, and He is the Best of providers. 73 And 
surely you call them to a right way. 

74 And surely those who do not believe in the Hereafter are 
deviating from the way. 75 And if We show mercy to them and 
remove the distress they have, they would persist in their inordinacy, 
blindly wandering on. 76 And already We seized them with punish- 
ment, but they were not submissive to their Lord, nor did they 
humble themselves." 77 Until, when We open for them a door of 
severe punishment, then they are in despair at it.

a (76) The punishment referred to in this verse, and the distress, the removal 
of which is mentioned in the previous verse, probably refer to the famine which 
overtook the people of Makkah. 

b (77) They do not take a warning from the milder punishment, so a severer 
punishment must follow. This overtook them in the form of battles, leading to 
their ultimate defeat. But the promise relates to the future as well.

Who gives life and causes death, and His is the alternation of the

like of what the ancients said. 82 They say: When we die and be- 
come dust and bones, shall we then be raised up? 83 We are indeed 
promised this, and (so were) our fathers before. This is nothing 
but stories of the ancients! 

84 Say: Whose is the earth, and whoever is in it, if you know? 
85 They will say: Allah's. Say: Will you not then be mindful? 
86 Say: Who is the Lord of the seven heavens and the Lord of the 

87 

mighty Throne of power? They will say: (This is) Allah's. Say: 
Will you not then guard against evil? 88 Say: Who is it in Whose 
hand is the kingdom of all things and He protects, and none is 
protected against Him, if you know? 89 They will say: (This is) 
Allah's. Say: From what are you then deceived? '"Indeed, We 
have brought them the Truth and surely they are liars. 91 AUah has 
not taken to Himself a son, nor is there with Him any (other) god 
— in that case would each god have taken away what he created, 
and some of them would have overpowered others. Glory be to 
Allah above what they describe — 92 The Knower of the unseen 
and the seen; so may He be exalted above what they set up as 
partners (with Him)! 

Section 6: Regrets of the Wicked 

93 Say: My Lord, if You show me what they are promised — 
94 My Lord, then do not place me with the unjust people. 95 And 
surely We are well Able to show you what We promise them." 
96 Repel evil with what is best. We know better what they describe. 



a (95) The promise given to the Holy Prophet in these verses is that the 
power of his persecutors will be broken in his lifetime. 

b (96) The doing of good in return for evil is the common teaching of all 
prophets. But nowhere is the principle put in such a beautiful and practical form 
as in the Quran. To return good for evil is only possible under certain circum- 
stances, and the Gospel doctrine — that ye resist not evil — has not been found 
practicable. The Quran, however, says, repel evil with what is best. If you can 
repel an evil by doing good for it, it is the course recommended; but if punishment

97 And say: My Lord, I seek refuge in You from the evil sugges- 
tions of the devils," 98 and I seek refuge in You, my Lord, should 
they come to me. "Until when death catches up with one of them, 
he says: My Lord, send me back, 100 that I may do good in that 
which I have left. By no means! It is only a word that he speaks. 
And before them is a barrier, until the day they are raised. c 

101 So when the trumpet is blown, there will be no ties of 
relationship among them that day, nor will they ask of one another. 
102 Then those whose good deeds are heavy, those are the successful. 
103 And those whose good deeds are light, those are they who have 
lost their souls, abiding in hell. 104 The Fire will scorch their faces, 
and in it they will be in severe affliction. 105 Were not My messages 
recited to you, but you used to reject them? 106 They will say: Our 
Lord, our misfortune overcame us, and we were a people in error. 
107 Our Lord, take us out of it; then if we return (to evil), we shall 
be unjust. 108 He will say: Go away into it, and do not speak to Me. 
109 Surely there was a group of My servants who said: Our Lord, 
we believe, so forgive us and have mercy on us, and You are the 
Best of those who show mercy. 110 But you ridiculed them, until 



is necessary, that would be the better course. It is the only workable principle of 
life. 

a (97) The evil suggestions of the devils were really suggestions of the 
wicked, who were opposed to the progress of Islam, and the Prophet is here told 
to look upon Allah as his only support. To seek refuge in the Lord is the height of 
goodness. Nowhere has a man a better refuge than in the Source of all strength, 
and no mortal can aspire to a higher honour than having his refuge in the Lord. 
The command to the Prophet to say this is really an image of the aspiration of his 
soul. His soul rested in that highest degree of security from all evil suggestions, 
which is termed refuge in the Lord. 

b (99) These words make it quite certain that the devils of the two previous 
verses are no other than the wicked opponents of the Holy Prophet. 

c (100) That the dead do not return to life is a principle which is reaffirmed 
here; see also 21:95. According to the Quran there are three states of a man's life, 
viz., his life in this world, his life in barzakh (referred to as "barrier" here) and the 
great manifestation of all spiritual realities that will take place on the day of 
Resurrection. Barzakh is the intermediate state in which the soul lives after death 
till the Resurrection. Here it is stated that no one who has passed into the state of 
barzakh is allowed to go back into the previous state. See further 39:42.

they made you forget remembrance of Me, and you used to laugh 
at them. a m Surely I have rewarded them this day because they 
were patient, that they are the achievers. 

112 He will say: How many years did you remain in the earth? 
113 They will say: We remained a day or part of a day, but ask 
those who keep account. n4 He will say: You remained only a little

you in vain, and that you will not be returned to Us? 116 So 
exalted be Allah, the True King! No God is there but He, the Lord 
of the Throne of Grace. 117 And whoever invokes, besides Allah, 
another god — he has no proof of this — his reckoning is only 
with his Lord. Surely the disbelievers will not be successful. 
118 And say: My Lord, forgive and have mercy, and You are the 
Best of those who show mercy. 



a (110) It was not really the believers who caused them to forget the 
remembrance of their Lord but, on account of their mocking the believers, the dis- 
believers forgot their Lord; hence the believers are here spoken of as though they 
caused the disbelievers to forget their Lord. 

b (115) This verse establishes the doctrine of the responsibility of human 
actions. Man is not created in vain, but he will be returned to his Lord to meet the 
consequences of what he does in this life. 



Chapter 24 
Ai-Nar The Light 

In verse 35 of this chapter Islam is shown to be the most perfect manifesta- 
tion of Divine Light to illumine both East and West, and hence the name of 
the chapter. As this light was to first illumine the houses in which Muslims 
live (v. 36), this chapter deals with the purity of home life. It begins by 
condemning illicit sexual relations and slander against women, and then it 
prescribes measures to prevent sexual immorality. It goes on to deal with the 
kindling of Divine light in Muslim hearts and the establishment of the king- 
dom of Islam. It ends by teaching respect for each other's privacy and for the 
Holy Prophet's orders as these relate to the welfare of the community. This 
chapter was revealed at Madinah, largely about 5 A.H. 



Section 1 : Law relating to Adultery 

In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful. 

1 (This is) a chapter We have revealed and made obligatory 
and in which We have revealed clear messages that you may be 
mindful. 2 The adulteress and the adulterer, flog each of them (with) 
a hundred strokes," and do not let pity for them detain you from 



a (2) Chastity, as a virtue, is not given the first place in modern civilized 
society. The breach of the greatest trust which can be imposed in a man or a 
woman, the breach which ruins families, destroys household peace, and deprives 
innocent children of their loving mothers, is not looked upon even as seriously as 
the breach of trust of a small sum of money. Hence the Islamic law seems to be 
too severe to the West. 

The punishment for adultery is here stated to be flogging, not stoning to 
death, which was really prescribed by the Jewish law. The cases of stoning to 
death for adultery by the Prophet's orders relate actually to a Jew and a Jewess in 
one case (Bukhari, 23:61), and others apparently occurred before the revelation of 
this chapter. That stoning to death was never contemplated by Islam as a punish- 
ment for adultery is made clear by 4:25, where it is stated expressly that the 
punishment for adultery in the case of slave-girls, when they are married, is half 
the punishment which is inflicted on free married women, and stoning to death 
could not be halved. Besides, the Quran nowhere speaks of stoning as a punish-

obedience to Allah, if you believe in Allah and the Last Day, and 
let a group of believers witness their punishment. 3 The adulterer 
cannot have sexual relations with any but an adulteress or an 
idolatress, and the adulteress, none can have sexual relations with 
her but an adulterer or an idolater; and it is forbidden to believers." 

4 And those who accuse free women and do not bring four 
witnesses, flog them (with) eighty strokes and never accept their 
evidence, and these are the transgressors — 5 except those who 
afterwards repent and act aright; surely Allah is Forgiving, 
Merciful. 

6 And those who accuse their wives and have no witnesses 
except themselves, c let one of them testify four times, bearing Allah 
to witness, that he speaks the truth, 7 and the fifth time (he shall 
swear) that the curse of Allah be on him, if he is lying. 8 And it 
shall avert the punishment from her, if she testify four times, 
bearing Allah to witness, that he is lying, 9 and the fifth time (she 
shall swear) that the wrath of Allah be on her, if he speaks the 
truth. 10 And if it were not for Allah's grace upon you and His 
mercy — and that Allah is Oft-returning (to mercy) Wise! 



ment for adultery. Flogging was aimed more at disgracing the culprit than at 
torturing him. In the time of the Prophet, and even for some time after him, there 
was no whip, and flogging was carried out by beating with a stick or with the hand 
or with shoes. The culprit was not stripped naked, but he was required to take off 
thick clothes. 

a (3) The idolater or the idolatress is mentioned along with the adulterer or 
the adulteress on account of the low standard of morality among the idolaters. 

b (4) This is an effectual restraint against slander and gossip, which so often 
bring disaster upon the heads of innocent women. Unless there is the clearest evi- 
dence of adultery against a woman, the slanderer is himself to be punished. 

c (6) The ordinance relates to the case of husbands who accuse their wives of 
adultery and have no evidence (see a case in Bukhari, 68:30). In such a case 
divorce is effected, the husband not being punishable for the accusation, though 
he cannot produce witnesses, and the wife not being punishable for adultery, if she 
denies the charge in the manner stated. The same procedure would be adopted in a 
reverse case. 

d (9) Editor 's Note: In this procedure, the testimony of the husband and of 
the wife are treated as of equal value and weight.

Section 2: Slanderers of Aishah 

11 Surely they who concocted the lie are a group from among 
you. a Do not consider it an evil to you; rather, it is good for you. 
For every one of them is the sin he has earned; and as for him 
among them who took upon himself the main part of it, he shall 
have a grievous punishment. 12 Why did not the believing men and 
the believing women, when you heard it, think well of their own 
people, and say: This is an evident falsehood? c 13 Why did they 
not bring four witnesses of it? So, as they have not brought 
witnesses, they are liars in the sight of Allah. d 14 And if it were not 
for Allah's grace upon you and His mercy in this world and the 
Hereafter, a grievous punishment would certainly have touched you 
for the talk you indulged in. 



a (11-1) The incident referred to here took place when the Prophet, accom- 
panied by his wife Aishah, was returning from an expedition in 5 A.H. Aishah 
had gone out on a private occasion, but, when she returned, she realized that she 
had lost her necklace, and went back to search for it. In her absence the attend- 
ants, supposing her to be in her howdah, started while it was yet dark. When she 
returned, finding the camel and the men gone, she sat down there and was brought 
to Madinah by a man who was in the rear of the party. Some mischievous persons 
from among the hypocrites spread false reports, slandering her, and some of the 
Muslims also associated themselves with the slander. Aishah's innocence was at 
length established by this revelation (Bukhari, 52:15). Those who had taken part in 
the accusation were punished, according to one hadith (Ibn Maja, 20:13). 

It may be added here that the tongue of gossip has never spared even the most 
virtuous women. Another case of a virtuous woman being thus defamed is that of 
Mary, the mother of lesus, about whom the Jews talked similar slander. The words 
— do not consider it an evil to you; rather, it is good for you — aim to bring 
solace to such aggrieved people. 

b (11-2) He who took the main part of it upon himself is said to be Abdullah 
ibn Ubayy, the chief of the hypocrites (Bukhari, 64:36), because he concocted the 
lie and circulated the false report. 

c (12) There was not a single witness, nor any circumstance that could lend 
colour to the false story. 

d (13) While the Quran takes a very serious view of crimes against chastity, it 
also makes criminal the circulation of false reports affecting a woman's chastity. 
Thus even a lighter accusation in connection with the misconduct of women 
required the evidence of four witnesses; see 4:15. 



24 : 15 • SLANDERERS OF WOMEN 435 

15 When you received it on your tongues and spoke with your 
mouths what you had no knowledge of, and you considered it 
trivial, while with Allah it was serious. l6 And why did you not, 
when you heard it, say: It is not worthy of us to talk of it. Glory be 
to You! This is a great slander. 17 Allah instructs you never to 
return to anything like it again, if you are believers. 18 And Allah 
makes clear to you the messages; and Allah is Knowing, Wise. 
19 Those who love that scandal should circulate with regard to 
those who believe, for them is a grievous punishment in this world 
and the Hereafter. And Allah knows, while you do not know.

Section 3: Slanderers of Women 

21 O you who believe, do not follow the footsteps of the devil. 
And whoever follows the footsteps of the devil, surely he commands 
indecency and evil. And if it were not for Allah's grace on you 
and His mercy, not one of you would ever have been pure, but 
Allah purifies whom He pleases. And Allah is Hearing, Knowing. 
22 And the possessors of grace and abundance among you should 
not swear against giving to the near of kin and the poor and those 
who have fled in Allah's way; and pardon and overlook. Do you 
not love that Allah should forgive you? And Allah is Forgiving, 
Merciful. c 



a (20) The same words in the next verse are followed by the statement, not 
one of you would ever have been pure. 

b (21) This passage shows that the companions of the Holy Prophet were 
purified from sins by Allah's grace. 

c (22) This verse was revealed in connection with the action of Abu Bakr, 
Aishah's father, who had sworn not to allow maintenance to one of his relatives 
named Mistah, who had taken part in spreading the false reports against Aishah. 
After inflicting the legal punishment on the culprits the Prophet was required to 
bear them no ill-will and to hide no rancour in his heart even towards the slanderers 
of his wife. Revelation even required his companions to be kind and forgiving to 
them. Abu Bakr is spoken of here as one possessing grace and abundance 
(Bukhari, 65.24:13), the former of these words referring to his moral and spiritual 
superiority and the latter to abundance in wealth. {Editor's Note: Upon hearing

(of the evil), are cursed in this world and the Hereafter, and for

they did, 25 on that day Allah will pay back to them in full their

own houses, until you have asked permission and greeted their 
inhabitants. This is better for you that you may be mindful/ 28 But

given to you; and if it is said to you, Go back, then go back; this is 
purer for you. And Allah is Knower of what you do. 29 It is no sin 



this revelation, Abu Bakr exclaimed: "I certainly love that Allah should forgive me", 
and then he resumed providing assistance to Mistah. This verse shows also that it 
is entirely baseless and false to assert that Islam prescribes the death penalty for 
those who commit "blasphemy" against its sacred personalities.) 

a (23) This refers to those who continue to spread evil reports concerning 
chaste women, the gossip-mongers in every society. 

b (24) The evidence of the members of the body is sometimes witnessed in 
this very life against the doers of evil, in the consequences of the evil done. On 
the day of Resurrection the consequences of the evil deeds will assume a palpable 
form, as is also indicated in the paying back in full of the just rewards in the next 
verse, and thus bear witness to the evil done. This highly developed idea of the 
Resurrection did not exist before the Quran. 

c (26) The meaning of this whole passage is made clear by the concluding 
words, i.e., nothing impure can be attributed to the pure ones, and they are free 
from what the impure ones say. 

d (27) The law revealed in this verse lays down the basis of domestic peace 
and security needed for an advanced society. It is also a preventive measure 
against slander. (Editor 's Note: This verse also supports the principle of having 
laws to safeguard the privacy of the individual within the home vis-a-vis the 
powers of the state authorities.)

visions. And Allah knows what you do openly and what you hide. 

30 Say to the believing men that they lower their gaze and 
restrain their sexual passions. That is purer for them. Surely Allah 
is Aware of what they do." 31 And say to the believing women that 
they lower their gaze and restrain their sexual passions and do not 
display their adornment except what appears of it. And they should 
wear their head-coverings over their bosoms. c And they should 
not display their adornment except to their husbands or their 
fathers, or the fathers of their husbands, or their sons, or the sons 
of their husbands, or their brothers, or their brothers' sons, or their 
sisters' sons, or their women, or those whom their right hands 



a (30) Men are told to lower their gaze, just as women are enjoined to do in 
the next verse. This injunction is given as a preventive against the evil of illicit 
sexual relations. The Quran does not only forbid an evil, but also points out the 
way, by walking in which a person may be able to avoid it. Both men and women 
are required to keep their eyes cast down, so that when they meet each other, 
neither should men stare at women nor women at men. In a society in which 
women never appeared in public, the injunction to men to lower their gaze would 
be meaningless; and the similar injunction to women given in the next verse, if 
they never left the compounds of their houses, would be absurd. 

b (31-1) To guard the relations between males and females and to check a 
too free intermingling of men and women, the Quran requires women in particular 
not to display their adornment. But there is a clear exception here — except what 
appears of it or except that which it is customary and natural to uncover. What is 
prohibited is really the display of beauty, as elsewhere expressly indicated: "And 
do not display (your beauty) like the displaying of the earlier (days of) ignorance" 
(33:33). According to Ibn Jarir, the exception mentioned relates to the face and 
hands. As an argument corroborating this opinion he says that, when praying, the 
woman is not required to keep her face and hands covered — hands up to the 
elbow — while she is required to cover the rest of the body. According to Hadith, 
the Holy Prophet himself is reported to have told Asma, his wife Aishah's sister, 
when she appeared before him in thin clothes, through which parts of her body 
could be seen: 'Asma, when a woman attains her puberty it is not proper that any 
part of her body should be seen except this, and he pointed to his face and hands" 
(Abu Dawud, 31:30). This settles conclusively that Islam never enjoined the veil 
or covering of the face. 

c (31-2) Before Islam women used to appear in public with their breasts partly 
uncovered. The khimar (pi. khumr) means a head-covering, and women were thus 
required to cover their breasts with a part of their head-covering.

possess, or harmless male servants," or the children who do not 
know women's nakedness. And they should not strike their feet so 
that the adornment that they hide may be known. And turn to 
Allah all, O believers, so that you may be successful. 

32 And marry off those among you who are single (to 
spouses), and those who are fit among your male slaves and your 
female slaves. If they are needy, Allah will make them free from 
want out of His grace. And Allah is Ample-giving, Knowing.* 
33 And those who cannot find a match must keep chaste, until 
Allah makes them free from want out of His grace. e And those of 



a (31-3) By theiv women are indicated all women who come in contact with 
them, or women who are on the same social level with them. Those whom their 
right hands possess include male and female slaves. Next to them are mentioned 
servants (called here as tahi'in or 'followers' because they follow the master), to 
which is added a qualifying phrase meaning, literally, not having need {of women) 
or lacking in cunning. These words mean male servants who take up service only 
as a means of living and not with the mischievous intention of getting intimacy in 
the house. It should be noted that women are nowhere forbidden to employ male 
servants or to appear before them. What this verse prevents is only display of 
female beauty except to those most nearly related to women, and this is a preven- 
tive measure against the spread of loose ideas of morality, and a step to help 
restraint of sexual passions, which is all that the Quran aims at. 

b (32) The Quran looks upon the married state as the normal state, and hence 
it enjoins that, so far as is possible, those who are single should be married. It also 
requires both male and female slaves to be kept in a state of marriage. The keep- 
ing of concubines is clearly inconsistent with this. Islam is against celibacy, and 
considers parenthood to be the duty of every human being. The Holy Prophet, too, 
laid stress on Muslim men and women living in a married state. Thus he said: "He 
who is able to marry should marry. For it keeps the gaze low and guards chastity; 
and he who cannot should take to fasting (occasionally), for it will have a castra- 
ting effect on him" (Bukhari, 30:10). On another occasion he said, addressing some 
young men who talked of fasting in the day-time and keeping awake for prayer 
during the night, and keeping away from marriage: "I keep fast and I break it, and 
I pray and I sleep, and I am married, so whoever inclines to any other way than 
my sunnah, he is not of me" (Bukhari, 67: 1). 

c (33-1) The words translated as those who cannot find a match may also 
mean those who cannot find the means to marry. Marriage thus becomes an obli- 
gatory institution in Islam, only those being excused who cannot find a match or 
who lack the means to marry. Marriage, in fact, affords the surest guarantee for 
the betterment of the moral tone of society.

your slaves who ask for a contract (to buy their freedom), give 
them the contract, if you know any good in them, and give them

And do not compel your slave-girls to prostitution when they desire 
to keep chaste, in order to seek the frail goods of this world's life. 
And whoever compels them, then surely after their compulsion

clear messages and a description of those who passed away before 
you, and advice for those who guard against evil. 

Section 5: Manifestation of Divine Light 

35 Allah is the light of the heavens and the earth. A likeness 
of His light is as a pillar on which is a lamp — the lamp is in a 
glass, the glass is as it were a brightly shining star — lit from a 
blessed olive-tree, neither eastern nor western, whose oil gives light, 
even though fire does not touch it — light upon light. Allah guides 



a (33-2) The word kitdb, or writing, as used here, stands for a contract 
between a slave and his master for the former to purchase his freedom. Though 
the practice of the master making such a contract with the slave prevailed before 
the advent of Islam, the important reform introduced by Islam was that, when a 
slave desired such a contract to be made, the master could not refuse it. Twelve 
centuries before any attempt was made by any individual or community to legis- 
late for the liberty of slaves, a dweller in the Arabian desert had laid down this 
noble institution, that, if a slave asked for a writing of freedom, he was not only to 
be given that writing by the master, but he was also to be provided with money to 
purchase his freedom, the only condition being if you know any good in them, i.e., 
if he is fit for work and able to earn his livelihood. And, in addition, the duty was 
imposed upon the State of spending a part of the collection of the obligatory cha- 
rity (zakdf) for this object, as stated in 9:60. 

b (35) Allah is called here the light of the heavens and the earth because He 
has manifested hidden things and brought them into existence. Mishkat means a 
niche, but it also has the meaning of pillar. In this parable, Islam is represented as 
a likeness of the Divine light, a light placed high on a pillar so as to illuminate the 
whole world; a light guarded by being placed in a glass, so that no puff of wind 
can put it out; a light so resplendent that the glass itself in which it is placed is as 
a brilliant star. It should be noted that the religion of Islam is repeatedly spoken of 
as Divine light in the Quran: "They desire to put out the light of Allah with their 
mouths, but Allah will allow nothing except the perfection of His light, though the 
disbelievers are averse" (9:32, 61:8). Hence it is of Islam that the parable of

to His light whom He pleases. And Allah sets forth parables for 
mankind, and Allah is Knower of all things — 36 (that light is) in 
houses which Allah has permitted to be exalted and His name to 
be remembered within them. a Therein do glorify Him, in the 
mornings and the evenings, 37 men whom neither merchandise nor 
selling diverts from the remembrance of Allah and the keeping up 
of prayer and the giving of the due charity — they fear a day in 
which the hearts and the eyes will turn about, 38 that Allah may 
give them the best reward for what they did, and give them more 
out of His grace. And Allah provides without measure for whom 
He pleases. 

39 And those who disbelieve, their deeds are as a mirage in a 
desert, which the thirsty man thinks to be water, until, when he 



Divine light speaks. The blessed olive, from which that light is lit, and which 
stands here for a symbol of Islam, as the fig stands for a symbol of Judaism (see 
95:3), belongs neither to the East nor to the West. Even so is Islam, which must 
give light to both the East and the West, and which, therefore, does not specially 
belong to either of them. The reference seems to be to the welding together of the 
East and the West in Islam, a prophecy which is now approaching its fulfilment in 
the awakening of the West to the truth of the principles of Islam. 

The parable becomes clearer if light is taken to refer to the Holy Prophet. 
The Prophet was by nature gifted with the highest qualifications. Even before he 
received Divine revelation, his life was a life of purity and devoted to the service 
of humanity. Light emanated from him even before the light from on High came 
to him in the form of Divine revelation, so that when revelation came to him it 
was light upon light. 

a (36) The Divine light spoken of in the last verse is here stated as being met 
with in certain houses, the distinctive mark of those houses being that the name of 
Allah is remembered in them, thus showing that these houses are the houses of 
Muslims, and the light is therefore the light of Islam. These houses, we are further 
told, though humble now, will be exalted. And the exaltation of the humble huts 
of the Arab dwellers of the desert to royal palaces is a fact of history. 

b (37) In these houses Allah is glorified in the morning and the evening, and 
therefore these can be the houses of no other than Muslims, because the keeping up 
of prayer and the giving of the due charity is the distinguishing characteristic of 
Islam. The opposition to His light, and the end of that opposition, are described in 
verses 39^40. The turning about of the hearts and the eyes means either that they 
will be transformed in the new life or that they will be in a state of commotion by 
reason of fear. The verse that follows lends support to the first meaning. 



24:40* MANIFESTATION OF DIVINE POWER 441 

comes to it, he finds it to be nothing, and he finds Allah with him, 
so He pays him his due. And Allah is Swift at reckoning — 40 or 
like darkness in the deep sea — a wave covers him, above which 
is another wave, above which is a cloud — (layers of) darkness 
one above another — when he holds out his hand, he is almost 
unable to see it. And to whom Allah does not give light, he has no 
light." 

Section 6: Manifestation of Divine Power 

41 Do you not see that Allah is He Whom do glorify all those 
who are in the heavens and the earth, and the birds with wings 
outspread? Each one knows its prayer and its glorification. And 
Allah is Knower of what they do. 42 And Allah's is the kingdom of 
the heavens and the earth, and to Allah is the eventual coming. 
43 Do you not see that Allah drives along the clouds, then gathers 
them together, then piles them up, so that you see the rain coming 
forth from their midst? And He sends down from the heaven 
(clouds like) mountains, in which is hail, afflicting with it whom 
He pleases and turning it away from whom He pleases. The flash 
of His lightning almost takes away the sight. 44 AUah causes the 
night and the day to succeed one another. Surely there is a lesson 
in this for those who have sight. 45 And Allah has created every 
animal of water. So among them is that which crawls on its belly, 
and among them is that which walks on two feet, and among them 
is that which walks on four. c Allah creates what He pleases. 



a (40) As the first part of the section gives a picture of the brilliant and dazz- 
ling Divine light given to the believers, the last part describes the utter darkness of 
doubt and ignorance in which the disbelievers are. Their apparent hopes of 
success are compared with a mirage, and, when they are undeceived of these, they 
will find themselves in the presence of God and will have their dues paid to them. 

b (45-1) Here only animals are spoken of as having been created from water, 
but in 21:30 we are told that all life, whether animal or plant, has been created 
from water. 

c (45-2) The various kinds of animal life are here divided into three classes: 
(1) The creeping things, the lowest and the first form in the development of 
animal life. (2) Those walking upon two legs, such as birds, the second form of 
the development of animal life. Man, though walking on two legs, is not included

whom He pleases to the right way. 47 And they say: We believe in 
Allah and in the Messenger and we obey; then some of them turn 
away after this, and they are not believers. 48 And when they are 
invited to Allah and His Messenger that he may judge between 
them, then some of them turn aside. 49 And if the right is on their 
side, they hasten to him in submission. 50 Is there in their hearts a 
disease, or are they in doubt, or do they fear that Allah and His 
Messenger will deal with them unjustly? But they themselves are 
the wrongdoers. 

Section 7: Establishment of the Kingdom of Islam 

51 The response of the believers, when they are invited to Allah 
and His Messenger that he may judge between them, is only that 
they say: We hear and we obey. And these it is that are successful. 
52 And he who obeys Allah and His Messenger, and fears Allah and 
keeps duty to Him, these it is that are the achievers. 53 And they 
swear by Allah with their strongest oaths that, if you command 
them, they would certainly go forth. Say: Do not swear (oaths); 
reasonable obedience (is desired). Surely Allah is Aware of what 
you do. 54 Say: Obey Allah and obey the Messenger. But if you 
turn away, he is responsible for the duty imposed on him, and you 
are responsible for the duty imposed on you. And if you obey him, 
you go aright. And the duty of the Messenger is only to deliver the 
message clearly. 

55 Allah has promised to those of you who believe and do 
good that He will surely make them rulers in the earth as He made 
those before them rulers, and that He will surely establish for them 
their religion, which He has chosen for them, and that He will 
surely give them security in exchange after their fear. They will 
serve Me, not setting up any partner with Me. And whoever is 



in them, because human life is the highest form of the development of animal life, 
and it is generally mentioned as quite distinct from all animal life. (3) Those 
which walk on four legs, and to this class belong most of the mammals.

and the Muslims made a ruling nation on earth. By those before them are meant in 
particular the followers of Moses. Islam at the time of the revelation of these verses 
was still surrounded by enemies on all sides; there was still fear for the believers, 
as the verse clearly shows, and idol-worship still had the upper hand in Arabia. 
The triumph of Islam, which is prophesied in the parable of the Divine Light first, 
and the gradual advent of which is referred to afterwards, is here predicted in the 
clearest and most emphatic terms: the believers will be made rulers in the earth; 
their religion will be firmly established; security will be given to them in place of 
fear; Divine Unity will rule supreme. All these favours will be bestowed upon the 
Muslims, for which they should be thankful; but, if they are ungrateful after that, 
they shall be dealt with as transgressors. The word kafara, to be "ungrateful", also 
means to disbelieve, and would mean here a denial in practice, or disobedience to 
Divine commandments. 

There is also a reference here to the Divine promise to raise reformers (sing. 
mujaddid) among the Muslims, as prophets were raised among the Israelites. 
Such is the clear promise contained in a saying of the Holy Prophet: "Surely Allah 
will raise up for this people (i.e., the Muslims) in the beginning of every century 
one who will revive for it its religion" (Abu Dawud, 36:1). The promise given in 
the verse may therefore refer not only to the temporal successors of the Holy 
Prophet, but also to his spiritual successors or reformers. The analogy of the 
Israelites, to which the verse refers, points to the appearance of a Messiah among 
the Muslims as a Messiah was raised among the Israelites, and it was on this verse 
that the claim of the late Hazrat Mirza Ghulam Ahmad of Qadian, the founder of 
the Ahmadiyya movement, was based. He claimed to be a reformer {mujaddid) for 
the fourteenth century of the Hijra and the Messiah whose advent among the 
Muslims was foretold.

a (58) Rules relating to personal and family privacy are of the utmost impor- 
tance in the betterment of social relations, and their non-observance leads to all 
kinds of false reports, which scandal-mongers are always ready to lay hold upon, 
thereby creating dissensions in society. 

b (60) The word used signifies a woman who has ceased to bear children and 
to have the menstrual discharge. The reference in putting off clothes is to the 
over-garment spoken of in 33:59. 

c (61) The Arabs had their scruples in eating with the blind, etc., in which 
respect they were like the Jews and some other people, including Hindus. Islam 
lays down a middle rule, and allows the individual a great latitude in this respect. 
A man may eat alone or with others, he may eat with the maimed, etc., or he may 
eat in the houses of near relations and friends. The latter part of the verse shows 
that a certain degree of familiarity with near relatives is recommended, so that one 
can take food with them, even though he may not have been invited specially. 



24 : 62 • MATTERS OF STATE TO TAKE PRECEDENCE 445 

Section 9: Matters of State to take Precedence 

62 Only those are believers who believe in Allah and His 
Messenger, and when they are with him on an important matter, 
they do not go away until they have asked permission from him. 
Surely they who ask permission from you, are they who believe in 
Allah and His Messenger; so when they ask permission from you 
for some affair of theirs, give permission to whom you will from 
among them, and ask forgiveness for them from Allah. Surely 
Allah is Forgiving, Merciful. 

63 Do not make the Messenger's calling among you as your 
calling of one another." Allah indeed knows those who steal away 
from among you, concealing themselves. So those who go against 
his order should beware that a trial may afflict them or there may 
befall them a painful punishment. 

64 Now surely Allah's is whatever is in the heavens and the 
earth. He knows indeed your condition. And on the day when they 
are returned to Him, He will inform them of what they did. And 
Allah is Knower of all things. 



a (63) It does not mean how the Prophet is to be addressed, but in what 
manner his call is to be responded to. The context makes it clear. The previous 
verse states that none is to leave without the Prophet's permission, when they are 
gathered together for some important matter requiring their presence, and the words 
that follow this passage are to the same effect. What is stated here is that the 
Prophet's call to the believers is to be respected, and not to be treated as their 
calling of one another; because the Prophet's call relates to some important affair 
affecting the welfare of the community, while their mutual calling of one another 
relates to their own private affairs. 



Chapter 25 
Ai-Fwqan The Criterion 

The name of this chapter, Al-Furqan, meaning criterion, distinction or discri- 
mination, is one of the names of the Holy Quran because of the distinction it 
brings about between truth and falsehood. It deals with the great transfor- 
mation which the Quran brought about in the lives of those who accepted it. 
At the outset it declares that the Holy Prophet's message is for all nations of 
the world. It goes on to assert the truth of the warning conveyed by the Holy 
Prophet and prophesies that a discrimination will be finally made between 
good and evil. It then draws lessons from the fate of previous peoples as well 
as from phenomena in nature. It ends with a description of the righteous, 
showing the transformation in people that the Quran was to effect. This chapter 
was revealed entirely at Makkah, most probably in the last period. 



Section 1 : A Warner for all Nations 

In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful. 

1 Blessed is He Who sent down the Criterion upon His servant 
that he might be a warner to the nations a — 2 He, Whose is the 
kingdom of the heavens and the earth, and Who did not take to 
Himself a son, and Who has no partner in the kingdom, and Who 
created everything, then ordained for it a measure.* 3 And they 
take besides Him gods who create nothing, while they are them- 
selves created, and they control for themselves no harm nor 
benefit, and they do not control death, nor life, nor raising to life. 



a (1) As this chapter deals with the mighty transformation which the Quran 
had brought about in the lives of the people, it is mentioned here by the name 
Furqan (criterion for distinguishing or discriminating between truth and false- 
hood). The words "he might be a warner to the nations" show that the transfor- 
mation which was being brought about in Arabia would ultimately extend over the 
whole world and all nations would benefit. 

b (2) Verses 2 and 3 speak of the different kinds of polytheistic beliefs 
prevailing in the world, which were all destined to be swept away by the doctrine 
of Divine Unity as preached by Islam.

25:4« A WARNER FOR ALL NATIONS 447 

4 And those who disbelieve say: This is nothing but a lie, which 
he has forged, and other people have helped him at it. So indeed 
they have brought an injustice and a falsehood. 5 And they say: 
Stories of the ancients, which he has got written, so they are read 
out to him morning and evening!" 6 Say: He has revealed it, Who 
knows the secret of the heavens and the earth. Surely He is ever 
Forgiving, Merciful. 

7 And they say: What a Messenger is this? He eats food and 
goes about in the markets. Why has not an angel been sent down 
to him to be a warner with him? c 8 Or a treasure given to him, or a 
garden from which to eat? And the evildoers say: You follow 



a (5) In the previous verse, their allegation is that the Quran is a forgery; 
here they allege that the Prophet had caused some stories of the ancients to be 
written down by some people who helped him and it was these stories which were 
recited to him and which he gave out as a revelation from on High. How could 
mere stories bring about the transformation which the Quran was working in the 
hearts of people? Attention to this is drawn in the next verse. 

b (6) The secrets of the heavens and the earth which are known to God alone 
include the secrets of human nature. Transformation in people's lives has always 
been brought about by means of Divine revelation, and mortal efforts have ever 
failed in changing the hearts of people. 

c (7) The Holy Prophet's life was one of the utmost simplicity. He did all his 
work himself. He aided his wives in their household duties, mended his clothes, 
tied up the goats, and even cobbled his sandals. In fact, his kind and genial nature 
often led him to do others' work. Once a woman, unable to work for herself, 
asked him to lead her into a certain street; he accompanied her there, only taking 
leave when her work was accomplished. He was a mortal, and partook of the ordi- 
nary food of a simple Arab. Hence they speak of him as eating food. The answer 
to this is given in v. 20, viz., that all prophets were mortal and subject to human 
laws, as was the Holy Prophet. 

d (8) Their idea of a messenger of God was that he should be rolling in 
wealth. In fact, wealth was all in all to them and they paid no consideration to the 
moral, the higher, values of life for which the Prophet came. They were at the 
same time told that, though the Muslims had to suffer privations, they would be 
rewarded for their sacrifices in this very life. Treasures were placed at the feet of 
the companions of the Holy Prophet, and they were given gardens. But all this 
happened in accordance with Divine law, which requires the fulfilment of 
prophecy to be brought about gradually, even as it requires all growth to be 
gradual in the physical world.

Section 2: Truth of the Warning 

10 Blessed is He Who, if He please, will give you what is 
better than this: Gardens in which rivers flow. And He will give 
you palaces. n But they deny the Hour, and We have prepared a 
burning Fire for him who denies the Hour. 12 When it sees them 
from a far-off place, they will hear its raging and roaring. 13 And 
when they are cast into a narrow place in it, in chains, they will 
there pray for destruction. 14 Do not pray this day for destruction 
once but pray for destruction again and again. 15 Say: Is this better 
or the Garden of Perpetuity, which the dutiful are promised? That 
is a reward and a destination for them. 16 They shall have in it what 
they desire, to abide. It is a promise to be prayed for from your 
Lord. c 

17 And on the day when He will gather them, and what they 
serve besides Allah, He will say: Was it you who led astray these 
My servants, or did they themselves stray from the path? 18 They 
will say: Glory be to You! It was not befitting for us to take for 
protectors others besides You, but You made them and their 
fathers to enjoy until they forgot the Reminder, and they became a 
lost people. ^ 19 So they will call you liars in what you say, then 



a (9) Elsewhere, the disbelievers are quoted as saying: "Why was not this 
Quran revealed to a man of importance in the two towns?" (43:31). Nothing except 
rank or wealth had any importance in their eyes. Their very conception of the real 
values of life was wrong, so they could not find a way. 

b (10) These words contain a clear prophecy that the Prophet and his follow- 
ers will receive the good things of this life too. The gardens of Mesopotamia, the 
palaces of Persia and of the Caesars, were given to the companions of the Holy 
Prophet. 

c (16) The Garden is promised to the faithful but they should pray to their 
Lord for its bestowal, because prayer to God is the means by which it can be 
attained. 

d (18) The words it was not befitting for us to take for protectors others 
besides You show that those who worshipped God alone could not ask their 
followers to worship others than God. The reference is clearly to Jesus Christ.

you can neither avert (punishment), nor (obtain) help. And 
whoever among you does wrong, We shall make him taste a great 
punishment. 

20 And We did not send before you any messengers but they 
surely ate food and went about in the markets. And We make some 
of you a trial for others. Will you bear patiently? And jour Lord is 
ever Seeing." 

Section 3: The Day of Discrimination 

21 And those who do not look for meeting with Us, say: Why 
have not angels been sent down to us, or (why) do we not see our 
Lord? Indeed they are too proud of themselves and revolt in great 
revolt. 22 0n the day when they will see the angels, there will be 
no good news for the guilty, and they will say: Let there be a 
strong barrier! e 23 And We shall turn to the work they have done, 
so We shall render it as scattered dust. 

24 The owners of the Garden will on that day be in a better 
abiding-place and a fairer resting-place. 25 And on the day when 
the heaven bursts apart with clouds, and the angels are sent down, 
as they are sent/ 26 The kingdom on that day rightly belongs to the 



a (20) This is an injunction to the Muslims to bear the persecutions of their 
opponents patiently, for these trials will distinguish the bad from the good. The 
concluding words are a solace to them: your Lord is ever Seeing — He will 
punish the oppressors. 

b (21) The coming of the angels and the Lord signifies the coming of the 
threatened punishment, and the next verse makes it clear; see 2:210. 

c (22) The words "strong barrier" bear different interpretations according to 
whether they are taken to be spoken by the angels or by the guilty. In the former 
case, the meaning is that good news will be a forbidden thing to the guilty, which 
is equivalent to saying that they will be punished. In the latter case, the words are 
a kind of prayer for the coming of a barrier between them and their punishment. 

d (23) All the exertions of the Quraish were brought to naught in the battle 
of Badr, and all attempts to uproot Truth are dealt with similarly. 

e (25) This description of the day of Badr is also given in 8:11-12, where the 
falling of rain is clearly mentioned, and on the same occasion is also mentioned 
the coming of the angels. The next verse shows that it will be a day of victory for 



450 25. THE CRITERION • 25 : 27 

Beneficent, and it will be a hard day for the disbelievers. 27 And on 
the day when the wrongdoer will bite his hands, saying: If only I 
had taken a way with the Messenger!" 28 woe is me! If only I 
had not taken such a one for a friend! 29 Certainly he led me astray 
from the Reminder after it had come to me. And the devil ever 
deserts man. 

30 And the Messenger will say: My Lord, surely my people 
treat this Quran as a forsaken thing. 31 And thus have We made for 
every prophet an enemy from among the guilty, and sufficient is 
jour Lord as a Guide and a Helper. 32 And those who disbelieve 
say: Why has not the Quran been revealed to him all at once? It is 
so that We may strengthen jour heart with it and We have 
arranged it well in arranging.* 33 And they cannot bring you a 
question, but We have brought you the truth and the best 
explanation^ 34 Those who will be gathered to hell on their faces 
— they are in an evil plight and straying farther away from the 
path. 



the Muslims, the believers in the Beneficent, and a hard day for the disbelievers. 
In fact, the distress and hardship the Quraish experienced in the battle of Badr 
were not tasted by them in any of their subsequent encounters with the Muslims. 

a (27) Commentators have here mentioned the names of some people who 
fought with the Prophet at Badr. But the statement is general and the evildoer 
often regrets the evil he did, when he suffers the consequences of the evil done. 

b (32) The Quran was revealed piecemeal so that, under the varying circum- 
stances through which the Prophet passed, the Divine revelation might be a source 
of strength to his heart; and then, as it were, to refute any suggestion that the 
revelation might remain a disorderly collection of fragments revealed under 
different circumstances, it is added that the entire arrangement was also Divinely 
accomplished. The arrangement of the Quran, according to this verse, was a part 
of the Divine scheme, brought about in the lifetime of the Holy Prophet. 

c (33) This verse lays down the basis of an important principle, namely, that 
the Quran not only contains answers to all objections against it, but also adduces 
arguments of the truth of the assertions made. No other religious book of the 
world satisfies this requirement, which circumstance alone places the Quran above 
all scriptures, and points to it as a unique revelation capable of satisfying the spiri- 
tual requirements of all people in all times. 



25:35' LESSON IN THE FATE OF FORMER PEOPLE 45 1 

Section 4: A Lesson in the Fate of Former People 

35 And certainly We gave Moses the Book and We appointed 
with him his brother Aaron, an aider. 36 Then We said: Go, both of 
you, to the people who reject Our messages. So We destroyed 
them with utter destruction. 37 And the people of Noah, when they 
rejected the messengers, We drowned them, and made them a sign 
for people. And We have prepared a painful punishment for the 
wrongdoers — 38 And Ad and Thamud and the dwellers of Rass 
and many generations in between." 39 And to each We gave 
examples and each did We destroy with utter destruction. 4 40 And 
indeed they pass by the town on which was rained an evil rain. e 
Do they not see it? But they hope not to be raised again. 

41 And when they see you, they take you only for a jest: Is 
this he whom Allah has raised to be a messenger? 42 He had almost 
led us astray from our gods, if we had not adhered to them 
patiently! And they will know, when they see the punishment, 
who is more astray from the path. 43 Have you seen him who takes 
his low desire for his god? d Will you be a guardian over him? 
44 0r do you think that most of them hear or understand? They are 
only as the cattle; rather, they are farther astray from the path. 

Section 5: A Lesson from Nature 

45 Do you not see how jour Lord extends the shade? And if 
He pleased, He would have made it stationary. Then We have 



a (38) According to some, Rass was a country in which a part of the tribe of 
Thamud resided; others say that Rass is the name of a town in Yamamah. 

b (39) The meaning is that every one of these generations was warned of its 
doom by citing examples of those who had previously perished, but, not heeding 
the warning, was destroyed. 

c (40) This town is Sodom, which was situated on the way to Syria. 

d (43) This verse shows how broad is the idea of shirk or polytheism accord- 
ing to the Quran. It is not simply worship of idols that is condemned, but blindly 
following one's desires is equally condemned. Many people who consider them- 
selves the servants of the One God really bow in submission before the greatest of 
their idols, i.e., their desire. The monotheistic doctrine has here been brought to a 
perfection not to be met with elsewhere. 



452 25. THE CRITERION • 25 : 46 

made the sun an indication of it, 46 then We take it to Ourselves, 
taking little by little." 47 And He it is Who made the night a cover- 
ing for you, and sleep a rest, and He made the day to rise up again. 
48 And He it is Who sends the winds as good news before His 
mercy; and We send down pure water from the clouds, 49 that We 
may give life with it to a dead land, and give it for drink to cattle 
and many people that We have created. 50 And certainly We 
repeat this to them that they may be mindful, but most people only 
consent to denying. 

51 And if We pleased, We could raise a warner in every 
town. c 52 So do not obey the disbelievers, and strive against them a 
mighty striving with it. d 



a (46) This and the previous verse show that Allah deals mercifully with His 
servants. He would not destroy them all at once. The sun of righteousness had 
risen, and there were clear indications that the shadows of darkness would disappear, 
but, as in physical nature, they would not disappear suddenly, but gradually, dimini- 
shing little by little. 

b (49) The mercy of Allah, which appears in the form of rain in physical 
nature, comes spiritually in the form of revelation. As the pure water from the 
clouds gives life to a dead land, so does the pure water of revelation from Him 
raise the spiritually dead to life. 

c (51) The companions of the Holy Prophet no doubt had this in mind when 
they spread far and wide, taking his message and warning to every distant town. It 
should, however, be noted that the verse does not contradict the statement in 
35:24, and elsewhere, that a prophet was raised among every nation. The chapter 
opens with the statement that the Prophet was a warner to all nations. The state- 
ment made here shows that, if God had pleased, He would have raised a warner in 
every town, but the oneness of humanity, which was a grand object following 
upon the Oneness of God, could not have thus been brought about. Hence the 
verse that follows requires a hard striving on the part of the Prophet and his follo- 
wers for this grand achievement. 

d (52) This verse affords a clear proof of the significance of the word jihad, 
as used in the Quran. Every exertion to spread the Truth is, according to this verse, 
a jihad; in fact, it is called the jihad kabir ("mighty striving") or the great jihad. 
Fighting in defence of religion received the name of jihad, because under the 
circumstances it became necessary for the Truth to live and prosper; if fighting 
had not been permitted, Truth would surely have been uprooted. The commen- 
tators all accept this significance of the word here. It should be noted that the 
greatest jihad which a Muslim can carry on is one by means of the Quran, to 



25 : 53 • A LESSON FROM NATURE 453 

53 And He it is Who has made the two seas to flow freely, the 
one sweet, very sweet, and the other saltish, bitter. And between the 
two He has made a barrier and inviolable obstruction." 54 And He 
it is Who has created man from water, then He has made for him 
blood-relationship and marriage-relationship. And your Lord is 
ever Powerful. 

55 And they serve besides Allah that which can neither bene- 
fit them, nor harm them. And the disbeliever is ever an aider 
against his Lord. e 56 And We have not sent you but as a giver of 
good news and as a warner. 57 Say: I ask of you no reward for it 
except that whoever wishes may take a way to his Lord. 58 And 
rely on the Ever-Living Who does not die, and celebrate His 
praise. And sufficient is He as being Aware of His servants' sins, 
59 Who created the heavens and the earth and all that is between 
them in six periods, and He is established on the Throne of Power, 
the Beneficent. So ask respecting Him one aware. 60 And when it 
is said to them: Be submissive to the Beneficent, they say: And 
what is the Beneficent? Shall we be submissive to what you order 
us? And it adds to their aversion. 



which the personal pronoun it at the end of the verse unquestionably refers, 
because such jihad must be carried on by every Muslim under all circumstances. 

a (53) Apparently the reference is to the sweet-water rivers flowing on earth 
or underground and to the saltish sea-water. But there is a deeper reference to the 
two lives which man leads on earth, a sweet life of faith and goodness, which 
brings satisfaction and peace to the mind, and a bitter life of faithlessness and 
wickedness, which ever increases the thirst for material gains and never brings 
satisfaction to the mind of man. Both existed in the world side by side, and so 
they would continue. 

b (54) The passage seems to hint at the flight to Madinah. The Prophet was 
related to the Makkans through his father, and to the Madinans through his mother. 
As his blood-relations had persecuted him and were bent upon killing him, he is 
now reminded of his relationship through marriage to another people. It was no 
doubt due to some such hint in the Divine revelation that the Prophet was 
searching, on the occasion of the pilgrimage, for adherents among the people of 
Madinah. 

c (55) The disbeliever aided the cause of untruth, as against his Lord, while 
the Prophet aimed at establishing the Truth in the world. 

d (59) The one aware is the Prophet, who possessed true knowledge of God.

Section 6: The Transformation brought about 

61 Blessed is He Who made the stars in the heavens and made 
therein a sun and a moon giving light! 62 And He it is Who made 
the night and the day to follow each other, for him who desires to 
be mindful or desires to be thankful." 

63 And the servants of the Beneficent are they who walk on 
the earth in humility, and when the ignorant address them, they 
say, Peace! 64 And they who pass the night prostrating themselves 
before their Lord and standing. 65 And they who say: Our Lord, 
avert from us the punishment of hell; surely its punishment is a 
lasting evil: 66 It is surely an evil abode and resting-place! 67 And 
they who, when they spend, are neither extravagant nor miserly, 
and the just mean is ever between these. 68 And they who do not 
call upon another god with Allah, nor slay the soul which Allah 
has forbidden, except in the cause of justice, nor commit 



a (62) The night is here spoken of as being the more opportune time for 
being mindful, i.e., for prayers, and the day for being thankful, i.e., for work and 
livelihood. 

b (63) From here to the end of the chapter is described the great transforma- 
tion which the Prophet had already brought about. The great qualities spoken of as 
being met with in the servants of the Beneficent present a striking contrast with 
the evils which reigned supreme in Arabia. They were an arrogant people, who 
trampled the rights of their fellow-beings under their feet, but the faithful now 
walked in humility and led lives of lowliness, in which they had the greatest 
regard for others' rights (v. 63). In the days of ignorance they passed their nights 
in drunken orgies, but now they kept awake at night in devotion and were instead 
drunk with the love of God (v. 64). In the days of ignorance they spent money 
extravagantly, when it was a question of pride, and they did not care for the poor 
dying of hunger, but now they spent every penny they could on others (v. 67). 
Formerly idols were worshipped in Arabia, human blood was shed on the slightest 
pretext, sex-relations were loose to an extreme, but they had now become the torch- 
bearers of Divine Unity, for whose sake they willingly suffered every privation, 
homicide was looked upon with abhorrence, the highest value was placed on the 
chastity of men and women, and righteousness was the one thing in which men 
and women vied with one another (v. 68-71). Truth and faithfulness were the 
great qualities that ruled people's minds, in the new dispensation, and a life full of 
vigour and earnestness was seen in the place of ignorance, superstition and 
immorality, which were the chief features of pre-Islamic Arabia (v. 72-74).

fornication; and he who does this shall meet a penalty of sin — 
69 The punishment will be doubled to him on the day of Resurrec- 
tion, and he will abide in it in humiliation — 70 except him who 
repents and believes and does good deeds; for such Allah changes 
their evil deeds to good ones." And Allah is ever Forgiving, Merci- 
ful. 71 And whoever repents and does good, he surely turns to 
Allah a (goodly) turning. 

72 And they who witness no falsehood, and when they pass 
by what is vain, they pass by nobly. 73 And they who, when 
reminded of the messages of their Lord, do not fall down at them 
deaf and blind. 74 And they who say, Our Lord, grant us in our 
wives and our offspring the joy of our eyes, and make us leaders 
for those who guard against evil. 75 These are rewarded with high 
places because they are patient, and are met there with greetings 
and salutation, 76 abiding there — a goodly abode and resting- 
place! 77 Say: My Lord would not care for you, if it were not for 
your prayer. Now indeed you have rejected, so the punishment

a (70) Here we are plainly told that the transformation had already been 
wrought; the vices in which the people indulged formerly had been changed to 
good and righteous deeds, and those who found pleasure in evil deeds now found 
pleasure in the doing of good. It was the soul-force of the Prophet that had 
wrought this miraculous transformation. 

b (72) They not only shunned falsehood but were now above everything that 
was vain or futile. 

c (75) Apparently they were being expelled from their homes but they felt as 
if they were being rewarded with high places, because their outlook on life was 
now spiritual and not material. In addition to the greetings and salutations of the 
angels they were promised greetings and salutations in their new centre of 
activity, Madinah, to which they were fleeing, because there a similar brotherhood 
of the righteous was now ready to receive these emigrants. 

d (77) The Truth had finally been rejected by the Makkans, so the disgrace 
and abasement which was promised for the opponents of Truth was now awaiting 
them. The righteous were finally separated from the wicked, so the punishment 
must come. 



Chapter 26 

Al-Shu'ara' The Poets 

The title of this chapter is taken from a reference to poets in v. 224, where the 
allegation is refuted that the Quran is the work of a poet. It opens by consol- 
ing the Holy Prophet that he need not be anxious because of the rejection of 
his message by the people or despair of their reform. Then the histories of 
several prophets are narrated, presenting the fate of their opponents as a war- 
ning to the Holy Prophet's opponents, and finally the subject reverts to their 
objections against him. This chapter, and the two following it, belong to the 
middle period at Makkah. 



Section 1 : The Prophet is consoled 

In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful. 

1 Benignant, Hearing, Knowing God." 2 These are the verses 
of the Book that makes manifest. 3 Perhaps you will kill yourself 
with grief because they do not believe. c 4 If We please, We could 
send down on them a sign from heaven, so that their necks would 



a (1) This verse consists of the letters fa, sin and mim, which may stand for 
the names of God: Lafif, meaning Benignant, Sami', meaning Hearing, and 'Alim, 
meaning Knowing. I may, however, suggest another interpretation. These chapters 
speak in particular of the calling of Moses at Mount Sinai, so fa sin may stand for 
Tur Sina', or Mount Sinai, and mim may stand for Moses; attention is thus called 
in these letters to the revelation granted to Moses at Mount Sinai, which bears 
testimony to the truth of the Prophet. This is corroborated by the plain statement 
made in the last chapter of this group, that the disbelievers called the revelations 
of Moses and Muhammad two enchantments backing up each other (28:48). 

b (2) The Quran makes manifest all that is needed for a right development of 
the human faculties, and it also makes manifest the whole truth. 

c (3) The Prophet was informed by Divine revelation of the doom of an evil 
generation, but instead of cursing it, he exerted himself heroically to save his people 
by bringing about a mighty transformation among them, a transformation for 
which he was so anxious that he is described here as almost killing himself with 
grief.

bend before it. a 5 And no new Reminder from the Beneficent 
comes to them but they turn away from it. 'They indeed reject, so 
the news will soon come to them of that at which they mock. 
7 Do they not see the earth, how many of every noble kind We 
cause to grow in it? 8 Surely in this is a sign, yet most of them do 
not believe. 'And surely your Lord is the Mighty, the Merciful. ° 

Section 2: Moses is called and sent to Pharaoh 

10 And when jour Lord called Moses, saying: Go to the wrong- 
doing people — "the people of Pharaoh. Will they not guard 
against evil? 12 He said: My Lord, I fear that they will reject me. 
13 And my heart is anxious, and my tongue is not eloquent, so send 
for Aaron (too). 14 And they have a crime against me, so I fear that 
they will kill me. 15 He said: By no means; so go both of you with 
Our signs; surely We are with you, Hearing. 16 Then come to 
Pharaoh, and say: We are bearers of a message of the Lord of 
the worlds: 17 Send with us the Children of Israel. 

18 (Pharaoh) said: Did we not bring you up as a child among 
us, and you stayed (many) years of your life among us? 19 Andyou 
did (that) deed of yours which you did and you are ungrateful. 



a (4) Such a sign was sent in the battle of Badr and again in the conquest of 
Makkah. In the former place their chiefs were laid low, and in the latter they 
accepted submission. 

b (6) It was the prophecies of their own defeat and of the predominance of 
Islam at which they mocked. 

c (9) Seven prophets in all are spoken of in this chapter, and it is related how 
the enemies of every one of them were exterminated in the final triumph of the 
Truth. Yet to give an indication of the fate of the Prophet Muhammad's opponents 
each prophet's mention is ended with the two attributes of the Divine Being men- 
tioned here, the Mighty, the Merciful, the first of these indicating that Truth will, 
even now, be made to overcome all opposition and the second that the dealing 
with the opponents of the Prophet would be a merciful dealing. The Prophet's 
opponents were defeated indeed but they were not destroyed and a reformed 
people rose again to power. 

d (14) The reference is to the killing of the Egyptian, as mentioned in 28:15. 
It is stated here that the people of Pharaoh charged Moses with a crime, not that 
he was actually guilty. See v. 20 and 28:15.

20 He said: I did it then when I was in error." 21 So I fled from you 
when I feared you, then my Lord granted me judgment and made 
me a messenger. 22 And is it a favour, of which you remind me, 
that you have enslaved the Children of Israel? 

23 Pharaoh said: And what is the Lord of the worlds? 24 He 
said: The Lord of the heavens and the earth and all that is between 
them, if you would be sure. 25 (Pharaoh) said to those around him: 
Do you not hear? 26 He said: Your Lord and the Lord of your fathers 
of old. 27 (Pharaoh) said: Surely your messenger, who is sent to 
you, is mad. 28 He said: The Lord of the East and the West and all 
that is between them, if you have any sense. 29 (Pharaoh) said: If 
you take a god besides me, I will certainly put you in prison. e 
30 He said: Even if I show you something plain? 31 (Pharaoh) said: 
Show it, then, if you are truthful. 32 So he threw down his staff, and 
lo! it was an obvious snake; 33 and he drew forth his hand, and lo! 
it appeared white to the onlookers. 

Section 3: Moses and the Enchanters 

34 (Pharaoh) said to the chiefs around him: Surely this is a 
skilful enchanter, 35 who desires to turn you out of your land with 
his enchantment. What is it then that you advise? 36 They said: 
Give him and his brother respite and send heralds into the cities 
37 that they bring to you every skilful enchanter. 38 So the enchanters 
were gathered together for the appointment of a well-known day, 



a (20) The circumstances in which Moses' act of striking an Egyptian with 
his fist led to the death of the Egyptian are related in 28:15. There was no inten- 
tion to kill the man, nor did Moses use any weapon with which death could be 
caused. The words "I was in error" (dall) indicate one perplexed, being unable to 
know what was incumbent on him. He used his fist against the oppressor, and 
death was simply accidental. 

b (22) The Israelites were employed only in menial work by Pharaoh and the 
Egyptians; it is this subjection to hardship which is here called enslavement. 

c (29) The gods of the Egyptians were innumerable. There were abstract gods, 
cosmic gods, human gods and animal gods. Pharaoh's claim to divinity among a 
people who were willing to deify anything has, therefore, nothing strange about it. 

d (33) See 7:108 and 20:20, 20:22, and the footnotes there. 



26 : 39 • MOSES AND THE ENCHANTERS 459 

39 and it was said to the people: Will you gather together? 
40 Perhaps we may follow the enchanters, if they are triumphant. 

41 So when the enchanters came, they said to Pharaoh: Will 
there be a reward for us, if we are triumphant? 42 He said: Yes, and 
surely you will then be among those who are nearest (to me). 
43 Moses said to them: Throw down what you are going to throw. 
44 So they threw down their cords and their rods and said: By 
Pharaoh's power we shall most surely be victorious. 45 Then Moses 
threw down his staff, and lo! it swallowed up their fabrication. 
46 And the enchanters were thrown down prostrate — 47 They said: 
We believe in the Lord of the worlds, 48 the Lord of Moses and 
Aaron. 49 (Pharaoh) said: You believe in him before I give you 
permission; surely he is the chief of you who taught you enchant- 
ment, so you will soon come to know. Certainly I will cut off your 
hands and your feet on opposite sides, and I will crucify you all. 
50 They said: No harm; surely to our Lord we return. 51 We hope 
that our Lord will forgive us our wrongs because we are the first 
of the believers. 

Section 4: Moses is delivered and Pharaoh drowned 

52 And We revealed to Moses, saying: Travel by night with 
My servants — you will be pursued. 53 And Pharaoh sent heralds 
into the cities (proclaiming): 54 These are indeed a small band, 
55 and they have surely enraged us, 56 and we are truly a vigilant 
multitude. 57 So We turned them out of gardens and springs, 58 and 
treasures and goodly dwellings — 59 Even so. And We gave them 
as a heritage to the Children of Israel. " 

60 Then they pursued them at sunrise. 61 So when the two 
groups saw each other, the companions of Moses cried out: Surely 
we are overtaken. 62 He said: By no means; surely my Lord is with 



a (59) The pronoun them refers to gardens and springs, etc., in general, and 
not to the particular gardens, etc., from which the Egyptians were turned out. The 
heritage of gardens and treasures was given to the Israelites in the land of Canaan, 
the promised land flowing with milk and honey.

to the sea with jour staff." So it parted, and each side was like a 
huge mound. ' 64 And there We brought the others near. 65 And We 
saved Moses and those with him, all. 66 Then We drowned the 
others. 67 Surely there is a sign in this, yet most of them do not 
believe. 68 And surely jour Lord is the Mighty, the Merciful. 

Section 5: History of Abraham 

69 And recite to them the story of Abraham. 70 When he said 
to his sire and his people: What do you worship? 71 They said: We 
worship idols, so we shall remain devoted to them. 72 He said: Do 
they hear you when you call (on them), 73 or do they benefit or 
harm you? 74 They said: But we found our fathers doing so. 

75 He said: Do you then see what you worship — 76 you and 
your ancient sires? 77 Surely they are an enemy to me, but not (so) 
the Lord of the worlds, 78 Who created me, then He shows me the 
way, 79 and Who gives me to eat and to drink, 80 and when I am 
sick, He heals me, 81 and Who will cause me to die, then give me 
life, 82 and Who, I hope, will forgive me my mistakes on the day of 
Judgment^ 83 My Lord, grant me wisdom, and join me with the 
righteous, 84 and ordain for me a goodly mention in later genera- 
tions, 85 and make me from among the heirs of the Garden of bliss, 
86 and forgive my sire, surely he is in error, 87 and do not disgrace 



a (63-1) This expression is similar to the one occurring in 2:60: "March on 
to the rock with your staff". Elsewhere the same idea is expressed by saying: 
"Strike for them a dry path in the sea, not fearing to be overtaken, nor being 
afraid" (20:77); see also 2:50. 

b (63-2) The sea had gone back, thus leaving a dry path (20:77) for the 
Israelites. The meaning may be that each wave, as it receded, was like a huge 
mound. 

c (82) The prophets, being always conscious of their weakness, seek Allah's 
protection. Expressions like this invariably indicate human weakness before Divine 
perfection, and are not evidence of sinfulness. Compare Jesus' confession of 
weakness in a similar strain: "Why do you call me good? No one is good but One, 
that is, God" (Matthew, 19:17).

made manifest to the deviators, fl 92 and it is said to them: Where 
are those that you worshipped 93 besides Allah? Can they help you 
or help themselves? 94 So they are hurled into it, they and the 
deviators, 95 and the followers of the devil, all. 96 They will say, 
while they quarrel in it: 97 By Allah! We were certainly in manifest 
error, 98 when we made you equal with the Lord of the worlds. 
"And none but the guilty led us astray. 100 So we have no inter- 
cessors, 101 nor a true friend. 102 Now, if only we could return once,

Allah and obey me. 109 And I ask of you no reward for it: my 
reward is only with the Lord of the worlds. 110 So keep your duty

the lowest (people) follow .you? 112 He said: And what knowledge 
do I have of what they did? 113 Their reckoning is only with my 
Lord, if you could perceive. 114 And I am not going to drive away 
the believers; 115 I am only a plain warner. 

116 They said: If you do not give up, Noah, you will certainly 
be stoned to death. 117 He said: My Lord, my people call me a liar. 
118 So judge between me and them openly, and deliver me and the 
believers who are with me. 119 So We delivered him and those with

123 Ad rejected the messengers. 124 When their brother Hud 
said to them: Will you not guard against evil? 125 Surely I am a 
faithful messenger to you: 126 So keep your duty to Allah and obey 
me. 127 And I ask of you no reward for it: my reward is only with 
the Lord of the worlds. 128 Do you build on every height a monu- 
ment, being vain? 129 And you make fortresses that you may abide 
forever. 130 And when you seize (people), you seize as tyrants. 
131 So keep your duty to Allah and obey me. 132 And keep your duty 
to Him Who aids you with what you know — 133 He aids you with 
cattle and children 134 and gardens and fountains. 135 Surely I fear for 
you the punishment of a grievous day. 

136 They said: It is the same to us whether _you admonish or 
do not admonish; 137 this is only a fabrication of the ancients, 
138 and we will not be punished. 139 So they rejected him, then We 
destroyed them. Surely there is a sign in this, yet most of them do 
not believe. 140 And surely jour Lord is the Mighty, the Merciful.

as having been drowned who rejected and persecuted him; see also 11:42 foot-

building that should acquire renown as a sign of greatness. These lofty buildings

violence were committed by Ad, while they considered themselves safe in their 
fortresses.

a (155) See 7:73 for Thamud. They are described in v. 149 as carving houses 
out of the mountains, and, as it appears from here and 54:28, the springs of water 
seem to have been few, and access to these was probably specially guarded, so 
that they were open only at particular times. For the she-camel, see 7:73. Salih 
seems to have demanded that the she-camel should be allowed to drink at such 
times. See 54:28, where it is stated that every share of the water will be attended 
by the she-camel, or that she will have access to water at all times when the others 
are allowed to drink. A similar demand as regards her pasture is contained in 
1 1 :64 in the words "Leave her to pasture on Allah's earth", followed by the same 
words as those following this demand for drink: "And do her no harm".

pressions signifying that the matter rests in the hands of Allah. Such statements 
are really equivalent to saying that the thing will certainly come to pass.

surely your Lord is the Mighty, the Merciful. 

Section 1 1 : Prophet's Opponents warned 

192 And surely this is a revelation from the Lord of the worlds. 
193 The Faithful Spirit has brought it," 194 on>>our heart that^ou may 
be a warner, 195 in plain Arabic language. 196 And surely the same 
is in the Scriptures of the ancients. e 197 Is it not a sign to them that 
the learned ones of the Children of Israel know it? 198 And if We 
had revealed it to any of the foreigners, 199 and he had read it to 
them, they would not have believed in it. 200 Thus do We make it 
enter into the hearts of the guilty. 2 



a (193) The Faithful Spirit (al-ruh al-amin) is the angel Gabriel, who brought 
the Divine revelation to the Holy Prophet. The Prophet himself was known in 
Makkah as al-Amin or the Faithful one before revelation came to him. 

b (194) The words on your heart indicate that the Prophet's heart, being the 
receptacle of the mighty revelation, was truly responsive to the great truths con- 
tained in it. The high morals and the broad humanitarian truths which the Quran 
contains give us a true picture of the great mind. This is referred to in one of the 
earliest revelations: "And surely you have sublime morals" (68:4). The pithy but 
most beautiful statement of Aishah, the Prophet's wife, remains unsurpassed in 
depicting the character of the Holy Prophet. When asked about it she replied: His 
character is the Quran, meaning that all those wonderful pictures of moral subli- 
mity drawn in the Quran were pictures of the noble mind to which the Quran was 
revealed. 

c (196) The prophecies relating to the advent of the Prophet Muhammad, as 
met with in the Jewish and Christian Scriptures, are referred to very often in the 
Quran. The statement made here is, however, more comprehensive: They are met 
with in all ancient scriptures. See 3:81, where a covenant is spoken of as being 
made through all the prophets of the world with regard to the Prophet's advent. 
There is a reference in the next verse to the learned men of the Children of Israel 
in particular because the Jews and the Christians had long been in contact with the 
Arabs. 

rf(199) Because prophecy plainly showed that the Arabs were to be the 
recipients of the revelation; see Isaiah 42:11: "Let the wilderness and its cities lift 
up their voice, the villages that Kedar inhabits.". In the Old Testament, Kedar, the 
son of Ishmael, stands for the Arab nation. Hence earlier prophecy required that 
the final revelation should be granted to an Arab. 

e (200) The meaning is that the Quran was made to enter into their hearts by

201 They will not believe in it till they see the painful punish- 
ment: 202 So it will come to them suddenly, while they do not per- 
ceive; 203 then they will say: Shall we be given respite? 204 Do they 
still seek to hasten on Our punishment? 205 Have you then 
considered, if We let them enjoy themselves for years, 206 then 
what they are promised comes to them — 207 what they were made 
to enjoy will not avail them? 208 And We destroyed no town but it

210 And the devils have not brought it. 211 And it is not befitting for

removed from hearing it." 

213 So do not call upon another god with Allah or you would 
be among those punished. 214 And warn your nearest relations, 
215 and be gentle to the believers who follow you. 216 But if they 
disobey you, say: I am clear of what you do. 217 And rely on the 
Mighty, the Merciful, e 218 Who sees you when you stand up, 219 and 



reason of the convincing proof of its truth; but they rejected it, as the next verse 
shows. 

a (212) The argument here is similar to that advanced by Jesus when he said: 
"And if Satan casts out Satan, he is divided against himself" (Matthew, 12:26). 
The evil one cannot be the source of the Quran, for the Quran calls to righteous- 
ness. See also verses 221-223. 

b (214) When this verse was revealed, the Holy Prophet, standing on Mount 
Safa, invited every tribe by name, and when the representatives of all the tribes 
had gathered together — among them being also the Quraish and that inveterate 
enemy of the Holy Prophet, Abu Lahab — the Holy Prophet thus addressed them: 
"Tell me, if I were to inform you that a great army in the valley lies in wait to 
make a raid upon you, would you believe me?" "Yes!" was the reply in one voice, 
"for we have never found anything but truth emanating from your lips." "Then," 
said the Prophet, "know that I am a warner to you of an approaching punishment." 
"May you perish," cried out the ill-tempered Abu Lahab, "was it for this that you 
called us together?" (Bukhari, 65.26:2). 

c (217) The Prophet is here told to rely on the Mighty, the Merciful, the very 
words that are repeated at the end of almost every section of this chapter, thus 
showing that the fate of the opponents of former prophets was spoken of simply to 
warn his own opponents. The attribute of mightiness is used to indicate the power 
to punish the wicked, while mercy indicates the deliverance and triumph of the 
righteous, or a merciful dealing even with the opponents.

226 and that they say that which they do not do? c 227 Except those 
who believe and do good and remember Allah much, and defend 
themselves after they are oppressed. And they who do wrong, 
will know to what final place of turning they will turn back. 



a (223) The subject of v. 212 is reverted to here. The opponents of the Quran 
would not listen to what is said in the Quran — they are far removed from hearing 
it, as stated in v. 212 — but they listen to what their leaders in evil say. 

b (225) That is, they pursue an aimless course, while the Prophet has a set 
purpose before him, and it is to make people walk in the ways of righteousness. 

c (226) The first suggestion of the disbelievers was that the Quran was the 
work of the devil. That being shown to be inconsistent with its very nature and 
with the righteousness it preached, they said that it was the work of a poet. As 
against this they are told that none of the characteristics of a poet's work are to be 
met with in the Quran. The poet never leads his followers to a life of righteous- 
ness, while the Quran was bringing about a pure transformation in the lives of 
those who followed it. Again, the poets say things which they do not practise, 
whereas the Prophet was not only a preacher of righteousness, but also an 
exemplar who translated into practice what he taught in words. And the weightiest 
consideration of all is that the poets cannot utter prophecies like those which are 
met with in the Quran. It is to this that attention is called in the next verse. 

d(221) The passage gives a description of the true believers in general, a 
new statement being introduced with ilia (except); or it may refer particularly to 
the poets from among the believers. 



Chapter 27 
Ai-Nami The Naml 

The title of this chapter is taken from the mention in v. 18 of a tribe known as 
the Naml in the story of Solomon and the Queen of Sheba. It begins by 
dealing with the histories of Moses and Solomon, indicating the likeness of 
their lives with that of the Holy Prophet. He was a law-giver like Moses and 
eventually ruler of a kingdom as Solomon was, yet retained the simplicity of 
the life of Moses. The chapter then refers to the prophets Salih and Lot whose 
opponents were destroyed and goes on to prophesy the triumph of the faithful 
and to indicate that in the Holy Prophet's case this triumph would be gene- 
rally through the spiritual resurrection of his opponents rather than their 
destruction. This chapter belongs to the middle period at Makkah. 



Section 1 : A Reference to Moses' History 

In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful. 

1 Benignant, Hearing God! a These are the verses of the Quran 
and the Book that makes manifest: 2 A guidance and good news for 
the believers, 3 who keep up prayer and give the due charity, and 
they are sure of the Hereafter. 4 Those who do not believe in the 
Hereafter, We make their deeds seem good to them, but they 
blindly wander on. ' 5 These are they for whom is an evil punish- 
ment, and in the Hereafter they are the greatest losers. 6 And you 
are surely made to receive the Quran from the Wise, the Knowing. 

7 When Moses said to his family: Surely I see a fire; I will 
bring you from it some news, or bring you a burning brand, so that 
you may warm yourselves. 8 So when he came to it, a voice issued, 



a (1) See 26:1 footnote, for explanation. The letters here are fa and sin. 

b (4) By their deeds are meant the deeds which they ought to perform. Evil 
deeds are made to seem good to evildoers by the devil (6:43), while Allah 
commends good deeds. Elsewhere we have: "But Allah has endeared the faith to 
you and has made it attractive in your hearts, and He has made hateful to you 
disbelief and transgression and disobedience" (49:7).

27:9* A REFERENCE TO MOSES' HISTORY 469 

saying: Blessed is he who is in search of fire and those around it. a 
And glory be to Allah, the Lord of the worlds! 9 Moses, surely I 
am Allah, the Mighty, the Wise: 10 And throw down your staff. So 
when he saw it in motion as if it were a snake, he turned back 
retreating and did not return. O Moses, do not fear. Surely the 
messengers do not fear in My presence — n Nor he who does 
wrong, then does good instead after evil; surely I am Forgiving, 
Merciful, 12 and put your hand into your bosom, it will come forth 
white without evil, among nine signs to Pharaoh and his people. 
Surely they are a transgressing people. 

13 So when Our clear signs came to them, they said: This is 
clear enchantment. 14 And they denied them unjustly and proudly, 
while their souls were convinced of them. See, then, what was the 
end of the mischief-makers ! 

Section 2: History of Solomon 

15 And certainly We gave knowledge to David and Solomon/ 
And they said: Praise be to Allah, Who has made us excel many of 
His believing servants! 16 And Solomon was David's heir, and he 



a (8) The words man fi-l-nar ("who is in search of fire") have been 
explained in several ways, the best being that in which the word fl (lit., in) may be 
rendered as meaning after or in search of. According to another explanation, these 
words mean that which is in fire and the place where fire was seen by Moses to be 
burning is meant. The addition of the words those for whatever is) around it is to 
show that the whole of this land was blessed, because so many prophets for the 
guidance of humanity were raised there. That the fire was not a physical fire is 
suggested by commentators. This is in fact clear. The voice that came to Moses 
was the voice of God and it came in the manner in which the Divine call comes to 
all prophets. Moses received a Divine revelation, and what he saw was during a 
state of transformation. 

b (11) The word ilia, with which this verse opens, does not here mean except 
but is equivalent to waw (and). Being joined to the "not" in the previous passage, 
the correct translation of ilia here is and not, i.e. nor. 

c (15) The history of David and Solomon, being the history of the temporal 
greatness of the Israelites, forms really a part of the history of Moses, and 
reference to it is in fact prophetical, to show that Islam was also destined to rise to 
greatness temporally as well as spiritually.

said: O people, we have been taught the speech of birds," and we 
have been granted all sorts of things. Surely this is manifest grace. 

17 And his forces of the jinn and the men and the birds were 
gathered to Solomon, and they were formed into groups. 18 Until 
when they came to the valley of the Naml, c a Namlite said: 
O Naml, enter your houses, (so that) Solomon and his forces may 
not crush you, while they do not know. 19 So he smiled, wondering 
at her word, and said: My Lord, grant me that I may be grateful 
for Your favour which You have bestowed on me and on my 
parents, and that I may do good such as You are pleased with, and 
admit me, by Your mercy, among Your righteous servants. 

20 And he reviewed the birds, then said: How is it I do not see 
Hudhud, or is it that he is one of the absentees? 21 I will certainly 



a (16) Solomon's understanding the speech of birds may imply the use he 
made of birds in carrying messages from one place to another, these messages 
being metaphorically called the speech of birds. The reference here is to the great 
resources of Solomon's kingdom in his victorious marches against near and 
distant enemies. Note also that Solomon says: We have been taught. This shows 
that his people also knew that speech. 

b (17) The jinn were men belonging to certain mountain tribes whom Solo- 
mon had subjugated, fair may mean either birds or horse, i.e., cavalry, as this 
word is applied not only to birds but also to swift animals such as horses. 

c (18) Many of the fables regarding Solomon have been due to a misconcep- 
tion of the word naml, taken as meaning 'ant'. It should be noted that wadi-l-Naml 
cannot be properly translated as the valley of the ants, for Naml is a proper noun. 
According to the classical dictionary Taj al- 'Urus, the valley of the Naml is 
situated between Jibrin and Asqalan. And Namlah is the name of a tribe which 
literally signifies the eggs of the ants. The name Namlah used also to be given to a 
child in whose hands an ant was placed at its birth, because it was said such a 
child would be wise and intelligent. 

d (20) The opening words may mean either a review of birds or a review of 
horses; see v. 17. By Hudhud is not to be understood the lapwing, but a person of 
that name. In every language many of the proper names given to people will be 
found to be identical with the names of animals. The Arab writers speak of a king 
of Himyar as Hudad, which is almost identical with Hudhud mentioned in the 
Quran. The Bible speaks of a king of Syria, named Ben Hadad (1 Kings 15:18, 
etc.). The Muntaha-l-arab states that Hudhad was the name of the father of 
Balqis, the queen of Sheba. The verses that follow show clearly that Solomon was 
speaking of one of his own officers. The infliction of severe punishment on a

punish him with a severe punishment, or kill him, unless he brings 
me a clear excuse. 22 And he did not remain away long, then said: I 
have encompassed something you do not have comprehensive 
knowledge of, and I have come to you from Saba' with sure 
information a — 23 I found a woman ruling over them, and she has 
been given all sorts of things and she has a mighty throne. 24 I 
found her and her people adoring the sun instead of Allah, and the 
devil has made their deeds seem good to them and turned them 
from the way, so they do not go aright — 25 so that they do not 
worship Allah, Who brings forth what is hidden in the heavens 
and the earth and knows what you hide and what you proclaim. 
26 AUah, there is no God but He, the Lord of the mighty Throne. 

27 He said: We shall see whether you speak the truth or 
whether you are a liar. 28 Take this letter of mine and hand it over 
to them, then turn from them and see what (answer) they return. 

29 She said: Chiefs, an honourable letter has been delivered to 
me. 30 It is from Solomon, and it is in the name of Allah, the 
Beneficent, the Merciful, 31 proclaiming, Do not exalt yourselves 
against me and come to me in submission. 

Section 3: History of Solomon 

32 She said: Chiefs, advise me in this affair of mine; I never 
decide an affair until you are in my presence. 33 They said: We are 
possessors of strength and possessors of mighty prowess. And the 
command is yours, so consider what you will command. 34 She 
said: Surely the kings, when they enter a town, ruin it and make 
the noblest of its people low; and that is what they do. 35 And 
surely I am going to send them a present, and to see what (answer) 
the messengers bring back. 

small bird by such a mighty monarch, as Solomon, and the exposition of the great 
religious doctrine of the Unity of God by the lapwing, are quite incomprehensible. 
a (22) Saba ' is the same as the Sheba of the Bible. The story as given here is 
not met with in the Bible, but it was known to Jewish rabbis. The Bible speaks of 
the coming of the queen of Sheba to Solomon with large presents to test him. See 
1 Kings 10 and 2 Chron. 9. And later on, it speaks of many strange women as 
Solomon's wives (1 Kings 1 1). 



472 27. THE NAML • 27 : 36 

36 So when (the envoy) came to Solomon, he said: Will you 
help me with wealth? But what Allah has given me is better than 
what He has given you. Indeed, you are exultant because of your 
present." 37 Go back to them, so we shall certainly come to them 
with forces which they have no power to oppose, and we shall 
certainly expel them from there in disgrace, and they shall be 
humbled. 

38 He said: Chiefs, which of you can bring me her throne 
before they come to me in submission? 39 0ne audacious among 
the jinn said: I will bring it to you before you rise up from your 
place; and surely I am strong, trustworthy for it. e 40 One having 
knowledge of the Book said: I will bring it to you in the twinkling 
of an eye. Then when he saw it settled beside him, e he said: This 
is of the grace of my Lord, that He may try me whether I am 



a (36) Why was Solomon angry on receiving a present from the queen? 
Later events, as narrated further on, show that the present sent to Solomon was a 
throne which was decorated either with nude art or with idolatrous paintings, or 
was offensive in some other way. Solomon's order in v. 38 to bring her throne to 
him shows clearly that by it was meant the throne which she had sent to him as a 
present, and his order in v. 41 to make alterations in this throne shows that the 
paintings on the throne were abhorrent to a true worshipper of God. 

b (38) As usual, the narrative here omits the return of the messengers to the 
queen, and her willingness to submit to Solomon on receiving the threat mention- 
ed in the last verse, and continues at the point where Solomon makes preparations 
to receive her. By her throne is meant the throne which she had sent as a present. 

c (39) The rising up from the place does not signify his standing up from the 
sitting posture, but his marching away from the place where he was at the time. 
The reference to being trustyworfhy shows that the execution of the work required 
an honest worker. The audacious jinn is apparently one of the Amalekites, who 
were men of large stature. 

rf(40-l) By one having knowledge of the Book is meant an Israelite as 
against the Amalekite referred to above. The literal meaning of the concluding 
words of the sentence is, before your gaze returns to you. It is the same as in the 
twinkling of an eye, the idea conveyed being that he could do it without delay. 

e (40-2) Strange and curious legends are introduced by some commentators 
on the supposition that the events narrated took place in immediate succession. 
The words so when he saw it settled beside him do not indicate that he saw it 
settled in the course of the conversation given in the previous passage. It is an 
altogether different incident. 



27 : 41 • HISTORY OF SOLOMON 473 

grateful or ungrateful. And whoever is grateful, he is grateful only 
for the good of his own soul, and whoever is ungrateful, then 
surely my Lord is Self-sufficient, Bountiful. 41 He said: Alter her 
throne for her; we may see whether she follows the right way or is 
of those who do not go aright." 

42 So when she came, it was said: Was your throne like this? 
She said: It is as it were the same; and we were given the 
knowledge before about it, and we submitted. 43 And what she 
worshipped besides Allah prevented her; for she was from a dis- 
believing people. 44 It was said to her: Enter the palace. But when 
she saw it she thought it was a great expanse of water, and 
prepared herself to meet the difficulty/ He said: Surely it is a 
palace made smooth with glass. She said: My Lord, surely I have 
wronged myself, and I submit with Solomon to Allah, the Lord of 
the worlds/ 



a (41) As pointed out in v. 36 footnote, Solomon was offended by the throne 
which the queen sent him as a present because of the indecent or idolatrous paint- 
ings on it, and therefore before she came to him, he caused certain alterations to 
be made in the throne. The purpose of the alteration is given here in express words, 
whether she follows the right way. In fact, she seems to have invited Solomon in 
the symbolic language of the paintings on the throne to her religion of idolatry, 
and by making alterations Solomon indicated that he could not make a compromise 
with idolatry. 

b (42) By putting the question, was your throne like this? Solomon wanted to 
draw her attention pointedly to the alterations made. The queen's answer shows 
that her envoy had already told her that Solomon was offended by the present 
which she had sent — we were given the knowledge before about it. The sub- 
mission referred to in the act of surrendering her kingdom does not mean that she 
had turned a Muslim. This is made clear in v. 43; she was prevented from becom- 
ing a true Muslim owing to her worship of the sun. Hence submission to God 
comes later; see the concluding words of v. 44. 

c (44-1) The use of the word saq (lit. shank or lower leg) to signify difficulty 
or distress in many phrases is a recognized idiomatic usage in Arabic. The expres- 
sion used here means that she prepared herself to meet the difficulty. {Editor 's 
Note: The literal translation, she bared her legs, has been made the basis of many 
groundless, vulgar stories about this episode.) 

d (44-2) It appears that, in order to impress upon the queen that it was the 
unseen hand of God that worked in nature, Solomon made water to flow under the 
smooth glass floor of his palace. Thus he conveyed to her the message in symbolic

Section 4: Salih and Lot 

45 And certainly We sent to Thamud their brother Salih, saying: 
Serve Allah. Then lo! they became two factions, contending. 
46 He said: My people, why do you hasten on the evil before the 
good? Why do you not ask forgiveness of Allah so that mercy 
may be shown to you? 47 They said: We consider you and those 
withjou an evil omen. He said: (The cause of) your evil fortune is 
with Allah; rather, you are a people who are tried. 

48 And there were in the city nine persons who made mis- 
chief in the land and did not act aright." 49 They said: Swear to one 
another by Allah that we shall attack him and his family by night, 
then we shall say to his heir: We did not witness the destruction of 
his family, and we are surely truthful. 50 And they planned a plan, 
and We planned a plan, while they did not perceive. 51 See, then, 
what was the end of their plan, that We destroyed them and their 
people, all (of them). 52 So those are their houses fallen down 
because they did wrong. Surely there is a sign in this for a people 



language that God was the real force behind all, as she had conveyed to him the 
message of idolatry in the symbolic language of the throne she had sent him as a 
present. The queen mistook the glass for the water which ran beneath; and when 
Solomon drew her attention to it, she at once realized her own error in worship- 
ping outward objects, like the sun, while the real force or the source of life was 
Allah, Whose hand worked in these objects. Perhaps in words, too, he impressed 
on her the great message of Divine Unity. The result was that the queen accepted 
the religion of Solomon — / submit with Solomon to Allah, the Lord of the 
worlds. The Quran here contradicts the Bible which holds that Solomon had gone 
over to idol-worship on account of his non-Israelite wives, while the Quran states 
that his wives were converts to his religion and believers in Divine Unity. 

a (48) There is no doubt a reference here to the enemies of the Holy Prophet, 
the chief of them being nine in number, eight of whom were slain at Badr, except 
Abu Lahab who died at Makkah on hearing the news of the defeat at Badr. 

b (49) There seems to be a prophetical reference here to the plot against the 
Holy Prophet, for the same plan was ultimately agreed upon by the Quraish to do 
away with him. One man from every tribe of the Quraish was selected and, taking 
the Prophet unawares, they were to thrust their swords into his body simul- 
taneously so that no particular tribe could be held guilty. This was agreed upon 
immediately before the Prophet's flight to Madinah, and thus the incident as 
relating to Salih is meant as a prophecy.

duty. 

54 And Lot, when he said to his people: Do you commit foul 
deeds, while you see? 55 Will you come to men lustfully rather than 
women? Indeed, you are a people who act ignorantly. 56 But the 
answer of his people was only that they said: Drive out Lot's 
followers from your town; surely they are a people who would 
keep pure! 57 But We delivered him and his followers except his 
wife; We ordained her to be of those who remained behind. 58 And 
We rained on them a rain; and evil was the rain on those who had 
been warned."

c (62) The manifestation of the marvellous power of God in nature, the crea- 
tion of the heavens and the earth, the sending down of rain, the making of rivers 
and mountains — all these wonderful signs of the existence of the Great Creator 
are here followed by another equally wonderful sign of the existence of God, the 
manifestation of His marvellous power in man. But mark the contrast. This mani- 
festation of the existence of God is not to be sought in the greatness and power of 
man as the conqueror of the forces of nature, but in his weakness in his great

certainly been promised this — we and our fathers before; this is 
nothing but stories of the ancients! 69 Say: Travel in the earth, then 
see what was the end of the guilty! 70 And do not grieve for them, 
nor be distressed because of what they plan. 

71 And they say: When will this promise come to pass, if you 
are truthful? 72 Say: Maybe something of what you seek to hasten 
has drawn near to you. 73 And surely your Lord is full of grace to 
people, but most of them do not give thanks. 74 And surely your 
Lord knows what their hearts conceal and what they manifest.

distress when, unable to find help from any source, he throws himself on the 
Divine threshold and seeks help from God. But what is more, this manifestation 
of God's power is beautifully mingled with prophecy — and He will make you 
successors in the earth. The distressed ones here are no other than the Muslims, 
who were being cruelly persecuted and tortured, and they are told that the mani- 
festation of God's power in making them rulers of the earth would be as great as it 
was in His creation of the heavens and the earth. This also shows the purpose 
underlying the narration of the histories of David and Solomon. 

a (66) Human knowledge cannot reach the life after death and God has given 
this knowledge to man through His revelation. But people are in doubt about it; in 
fact, they shut their eyes to it. 



27 : 76 • PASSING AWAY OF OPPOSITION 477 

76 Surely this Quran declares to the Children of Israel most of 
what they differ about. 77 And surely it is a guidance and a mercy 
for the believers. 78 Trulyyour Lord will judge between them by 
His judgment, and He is the Mighty, the Knowing. 79 So rely on 
Allah. Surely you are on the plain truth. 

80 Certainly you cannot make the dead to hear, nor can you 
make the deaf to hear the call, when they turn back retreating. a 
81 Nor can you lead the blind out of their error. 7ou can make none 
to hear except those who believe in Our messages, so they submit. 
82 And when the word comes to pass against them, We shall bring 
forth for them a creature from the earth that will speak to them, 
because people did not believe in Our messages.* 

Section 7: Passing away of Opposition 

83 And the day when We gather from every nation a company 
from among those who rejected Our messages, then they will be 
formed into groups. 84 Until, when they come (before Him), He 
will say: Did you reject My messages without comprehending 
them by knowledge? Or what was it that you did? 85 And the word 
will come to pass against them because they were unjust, so they 
will not speak. 86 Do they not see that We have made the night that 
they may rest in it, and the day to give light? Surely there are 
signs in this for a people who believe. 

87 And the day when the trumpet is blown, then those in the 



a (80) This verse is a clear testimony to what is meant by the Prophet's 
raising the dead; for here we are told that, if the dead turn back retreating, the 
Prophet cannot make them hear. Evidently this verse and the opening words of the 
next speak of the reprobate who shut their eyes and close their ears to all truth. 

b (82) By the creature from the earth that will speak to them are evidently 
meant people who are bent low upon earth. These people are the materialistic 
nations of the West who have lost all sense of the higher values of life. The 
coming forth of this creature, the dabbat al-ard, is one of the signs of the 
approach of the Hour according to the Hadith. But the Hour may mean either the 
day of Judgment or the doom of a people, and this verse gives us an indication 
that the Hour in this case stands for the doom of a nation; because here it is 
spoken of as being a punishment for not believing in the Divine messages.

heavens and those in the earth will be struck with terror, except 
such as Allah please. And all shall come to Him humbled. a 88 And 
you see the mountains, you think them firmly fixed — they shall 
pass away as the passing away of the cloud: the handiwork of 
Allah, Who has made everything thoroughly. Surely He is Aware 
of what you do. 89 Whoever brings good, he will have better than 
it; and they will be secure from terror that day. 90 And whoever 
brings evil, these will be thrown down on their faces into the Fire. 
Are you rewarded (anything) except for what you did? 

91 I am commanded only to serve the Lord of this city, c Who 
has made it sacred, and His are all things, and I am commanded to

goes aright, goes aright only for the good of his own soul, and 
whoever goes astray — say: I am only a warner. 93 And say: Praise 
be to Allah! He will show you His signs so that you shall recog- 
nize them. Andyour Lord is not heedless of what you do. 



a (87) As a foretaste of what was in store for the rejectors of the Truth, the 
prophecy was also brought to fulfilment in this life. The whole of Arabia recog- 
nized the Holy Prophet as its temporal and spiritual head, and the proud oppo- 
nents were humbled. 

b (88) In the passing away of the mountains there is a clear reference to the 
removal of the mighty men who opposed the Prophet's preaching. This is also 
shown by the concluding words of the verse, which clearly speak of the punish- 
ment of the evil deeds by One Who is Aware of what they do. 

c (91) The statement here that the Prophet is commanded to serve the Lord 
of the city of Makkah contains an allusion that the servant of the Lord will be the 
lord of that city. 

d (93) Note the firmness of the tone in which the showing of signs is 
asserted. 



Chapter 28 
Ai-Qasas The Narrative 

This chapter is chiefly a narrative of the story of Moses. After relating events 
of the life of Moses it announces that a prophet like him had now appeared 
with true revelation like the revelation of Moses, and its opponents will be 
humbled. In the end it says that their great wealth will not make them 
successful and prophesies that the Holy Prophet will return to Makkah in 
triumph. This chapter belongs to the middle period at Makkah, although v. 85 
would appear to have been revealed when the Holy Prophet was fleeing from 
Makkah to Madinah.

of the Book that makes manifest. 3 We recite to you the story of 
Moses and Pharaoh with truth, for a people who believe. 4 Surely 
Pharaoh exalted himself in the land and made its people into 
parties, weakening one party from among them; he slaughtered 
their sons and let their women live. Surely he was one of the 
mischief-makers. 5 And We desired to bestow a favour upon those 
who were considered weak in the land, and to make them the 
leaders, and to make them the heirs, c 6 and to grant them power in 
the land, and to make Pharaoh and Haman and their forces see 
from them what they feared. 



a (1) See 26: 1 footnote, for explanation. 

b (4) The two parties were the Israelites and the Egyptians, the latter being 
made the taskmasters of the former. This refers no doubt to the persecutions of the 
Muslims. The Quraish, the stronger party, wanted to crush the weaker party of the 
Muslims. 

c (5) By making them heirs is not meant that they would be made heirs to 
Pharaoh's possession, but heirs to a kingdom in the promised land of Canaan. 
And this refers also to the establishment of the kingdom of Islam and the defeat of 
its persecutors. 

d (6) Haman seems to have been a minister of Pharaoh. He is spoken of

7 And We revealed to Moses' mother, saying: Suckle him; 
then when you fear for him, cast him into the river and do not fear, 
nor grieve; surely We shall bring him back to you and make him a 
messenger (of Ours). 8 So Pharaoh's people took him up — he 
would be an enemy and a grief for them. Surely Pharaoh and 
Haman and their forces were wrongdoers. 9 And Pharaoh's wife 
said: A joy of the eyes to me and to you — do not kill him; maybe 
he will be useful to us, or we may take him for a son. And they did 
not perceive. 

10 And the heart of Moses' mother was free (from anxiety). a 
She would almost have disclosed it, if We had not strengthened her 
heart, that she might be one of the believers. u And she said to his 
sister: Follow him up. So she watched him from a distance, while 
they did not perceive. 12 And We did not allow him to be suckled 
before, so she said: Shall I point out to you the people of a house 
who will bring him up for you, and they will wish him well? 13 So 
We gave him back to his mother that she might be comforted, and 
not grieve, and that she might know that the promise of Allah is 
true. But most of them do not know.* 

Section 2: History of Moses — flees Egypt 

14 And when he attained his maturity and became full-grown, 
We granted him wisdom and knowledge. And thus do We reward 
those who do good (to others). 15 And he went into the city at a 
time of carelessness on the part of its people, so he found in it two 

again in v. 8 and 38, and also in 29:39 and 40:24, 36. Pharaoh and his counsellors 
feared that the Israelites, who were aliens in the land of Egypt, might one day 
become powerful and supreme in the land. Hence they oppressed and persecuted 
them in various ways. Yet the Divine intention was to bring about what Pharaoh 
feared. Such also was the Divine intention with regard to the persecuted Muslims. 

a (10) Her heart became free from anxiety on account of the assurance which 
she had received through Divine revelation; the words that follow show that her 
heart had been strengthened with patience, so it cannot be said to have become 
devoid, or free, of patience. 

b (13) The reference is clearly to the opponents of the Holy Prophet, who did 
not know that the promise of Allah, as given to the faithful, would prove true.

men fighting — one being of his community and the other of his 
enemies; and he who was of his community cried out to him for 
help against him who was of his enemies, so Moses struck him with 
his fist and killed him. He said: This is on account of the devil's 
doing; surely he is an enemy, openly leading astray." 16 He said: 
My Lord, surely I have done harm to myself, so protect me; so 
He protected him. Surely He is the Forgiving, the Merciful. 
17 He said: My Lord, because You have bestowed a favour on me, 
I shall never be a backer of the guilty. 

18 And (the next day) he was in the city, fearing, awaiting, 
when suddenly, he who had asked his assistance the day before 
was crying out to him for help. Moses said to him: You are surely 
clearly doing wrong. c 19 So when he desired to seize him who was 
an enemy to them both, he said: Moses, do you intend to kill me as 
you killed a person yesterday? Fou only desire to be a tyrant in the 
land, and you do not intend to be of those who act aright. 

20 And a man came running from the remotest part of the city. 
He said: Moses, the chiefs are consulting together to kill you, so 
depart (at once); surely I am one of your well-wishers. 21 So he 
went forth from it, fearing, awaiting. He said: My Lord, deliver 
me from the unjust people. 



a (15) The word "this", in Moses' statement, refers to the punishment which 
he had given to the Egyptian, the meaning being that it was on account of his 
devilish deed that the Egyptian had been so punished. The Rabbinical explanation 
of Exodus 2:12 is that the Egyptian merited death "because he had forced an 
Israelitish woman to commit adultery with him" (Jewish Encyclopedia, vol. ix, p. 
48). The Quran does not name the offence, but there is no doubt that it calls his 
offence a devilish deed. V. 17 shows clearly that Moses did not consider himself 
as one who had done an unjust deed or helped a guilty person. See also 26:14. 

b (16) Moses' prayer is not evidence of his being guilty, for the word zulm 
used here indicates making to suffer harm, loss, detriment or failure, and this is 
the meaning of zulm adopted in 7:160 and 18:33. The meaning here is that he had 
risked his own life in giving help to another. 

c (18) Moses helped the man on the first occasion because he was oppressed, 
but now this very man was oppressing another. Therefore he refused to help him.

Section 3: History of Moses — In Midian 

22 And when he turned his face towards Midian, he said: 
Maybe my Lord will guide me in the right path. 23 And when he 
came to the water of Midian, he found there a group of men 
watering, and he found besides them two women keeping back 
(their flocks). He said: What is the matter with you two? They said: 
We cannot water until the shepherds take away (their sheep) from 
the water; and our father is a very old man. 24 So he watered (their 
sheep) for them, then went back to the shade, and said: My Lord, 
I stand in need of whatever good You may send to me. 

25 Then one of the two women came to him walking bash- 
fully. She said: My father invites you that he may reward you for 
having watered for us." So when he came to him and related to 
him the story, he said: Do not fear, you are secure from the unjust 
people. 26 0ne of them said: Father, employ him; surely the best 
one you can employ is the strong, the faithful one. 27 He said: I desire 
to marry one of these two daughters of mine to you on condition 
that you serve me for eight years; but, if you complete ten, it will 
be of your own free will, and I do not wish to be hard on you. 
If Allah please, you will find me (to be) one of the righteous.* 



a (25) The commentators say this man was Shuaib, and Shuaib is mentioned 
by the name of Jethro in the Bible. 

b (27) In Moses' stay at Midian for ten years, there is a prophetical reference 
to the ten years of the Prophet's life at Madinah. The mention of eight years has 
another underlying significance, for it was after eight years that the Prophet came 
back to Makkah as a conqueror, a clear reference to which is contained further on 
in v. 85: He Who has made the Quran binding on you will surely bring you back 
to the Place of Return. This occurred exactly eight years after his Flight. That such 
is the real significance of relating this narrative is made clear in v. 45, where the 
Prophet is thus addressed: And you were not dwelling among the people of Midian, 
reciting to them Our messages. It is, as it were, to say that it was Moses who lived 
among the people of Midian, but his episode really conveys the news of what will 
happen to you. 

It may be added here that Moses was paid his wages, and the condition of his 
staying in Midian for eight or ten years was as much in his own interest as in the 
interest of Jethro, for as the Bible narrative shows, Pharaoh had died by the time 
that Moses' stay in Midian had come to an end.

28 He said: That is (agreed) between me and you; whichever of the 
two terms I fulfil, there will be no injustice to me; and Allah is 
surety over what we say.
