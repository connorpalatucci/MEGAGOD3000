time the buddha was in the amra gardens in the city of vaishali  accompanied by a multitude of leading monks numbering eight thousand . there were also thirtytwo thousand bodhisattvas  all known to the assembly  persons who had carried out all the basic practices of great wisdom . sustained by the might and supernatural powers of the buddhas  they accepted and upheld the correct law in order to guard the citadel of the dharma . they knew how to roar the lion s roar  and their fame resounded in the ten directions . without waiting to be asked  they befriended others and brought them comfort . they ensured the continuance and prosperity of the three treasures  making certain that these never expired . they conquered and subdued the ill will of the devils and curbed the nonbuddhist doctrines . all were spotless and pure  having long ago rid themselves of snares and obstructions  their minds constantly resided in a state of unhindered emancipation . their mindfulness  meditation  retention of the teachings  and eloquence never faltered  and of almsgiving  keeping of the precepts  forbearance  assiduousness  meditation  wisdom  and the power to employ expedient means  there was not one they were deficient in . they had learned to accept the fact that there is nothing to be grasped at  no view of phenomena to be entertained . they knew how to respond compliantly to others and to turn the unregressing wheel of the law . expert in comprehending the characteristics of phenomena  able to understand the capacities of living beings  they towered over the others of the great assembly and had learned to be fearful of nothing . with their merits and wisdom they disciplined their minds  they adorned their bodies with auspicious signs  ranking foremost in aspect and form  but rejected all worldly embellishments . in fame and renown they soared higher than mount sumeru  their profound faith was diamondlike in its firmness . the jewels of their dharma shone everywhere  raining down sweet dew  and among the assembly the sound of their words was the most subtle and wonderful of all . they had plumbed the depths of dependent origination and cut off all erroneous views  no longer entertaining the concepts either of being or nonbeing . in expounding the law they were fearless as roaring lions  and their disquisitions on it rolled forth like thunder . there was no measuring them  for they had passed beyond measure . in seeking out the jewels of the dharma  they were like practiced pilots at sea . they had mastered all the profound and subtle meanings of the doctrines and were expert in perceiving the past and future existences of living beings and the workings of their minds . they came close to equaling the freely exercised wisdom of the buddha  the unparalleled one  his ten powers  his fearlessness  and his eighteen unshared properties . though they had firmly closed the gate to all manner of evil existences  yet they allowed themselves to be born in the five lower realms  manifesting themselves there so that they might act as great physician kings  adroitly healing the ills of others  doling out whatever medicine suited the ailment  and insuring that the patient took it as prescribed . countless benefitsall these they had acquired  countless buddha lands all these they had made marvelously pure . no one saw or listened to them without profiting thereby  and no action of theirs was ever performed in vain . such was the manner in which all merits adhered to them . the names of the bodhisattvas were bodhisattva viewing equality  bodhisattva viewing inequality  bodhisattva viewing equality and inequality  bodhisattva meditation freedom king  bodhisattva dharma freedom king  bodhisattva dharma forms  bodhisattva shining forms  bodhisattva

bodhisattva jeweled staff  bodhisattva unsurpassed  bodhisattva adorned land  bodhisattva golden locks  bodhisattva gemmed locks  bodhisattva maitreya  and bodhisattva dharma prince manjushri . there were thirtytwo thousand bodhisattvas such as these there were also ten thousand brahma kings  shikhin and others  who had come from the other four continent worlds to visit the place where the buddha was and listen to the dharma . there were also twelve thousand indras who had come from the other four continent worlds to take a seat in the gathering . in addition  there were other heavenly beings of great authority and power  as well as dragons  spirits  yakshas  gandharvas  asuras  garudas  kimnaras  mahoragas  and others  all come to take a seat in the assembly . also arrived to take seats in the assembly were the various monks  nuns  laymen  and laywomen . at that time the buddha  reverently surrounded by this multitude of countless hundreds and thousands of beings  expounded the law for them . he was like mount sumeru  king of mountains  rising up out of the great sea . resting at ease in his lion s seat clustered with jewels  he shed his radiance over all the great throng gathered there . at that time a man named jeweled accumulation  son of a wealthy man of the city of vaishali  along with five hundred other sons of wealthy men  had come to the place where the buddha was  all of them bearing parasols adorned with the seven treasures . bowing their heads in obeisance before the feet of the buddha  they joined in offering their parasols as alms to the buddha . the buddha with his supernatural powers then caused all the jeweled parasols to come together and form one single parasol that spread over the entire thousandmillionfold world . all the vast features of that world were visible there in its midst . all the mount sumerus of the thousandmillionfold world  snow mountains  muchilinda mountains  mahamuchilinda mountains  fragrant mountains  jeweled mountains  gold mountains  black mountains  iron encircling mountains  great iron encircling mountains  the huge seas  the rivers and watercourses  brooks and streams  fountains and springs  as well as the suns  moons  stars  constellations  heavenly palaces  dragon palaces  and the palaces of the venerable spiritsall these were to be seen within the jeweled parasol . and the buddhas of the ten directions  the buddhas as they preached the lawthese too were visible within the jeweled parasol . at that time all the members of the great assembly  witnessing this manifestation of the buddha s supernatural powers  sighed in admiration at what they had never seen before . pressing their palms together  they made obeisance to the buddha  gazing up in reverence at the face of the honored one and never taking their eyes from it . then the rich man s son  jeweled accumulation  in the presence of the buddha recited these verses of praise  eyes pure and broad like the blue lotus  mind pure  steeped in meditations  for pure deeds long accumulated  boundless in fame  your quietude guides the assemblythus we bow our heads . we have seen the great sage work miraculous transformations  showing us all the countless lands in ten directions  the buddhas expounding the law therein every one of these we have seen and heard . the dharma king s dharma powers surpass all other beings  constantly he bestows dharma riches on them all . skillfully he distinguishes the characteristics of phenomena  never faltering in his grasp of the one great truth . you have learned to treat all phenomena with freedom  so we bow our heads to this dharma king . you define things as neither existing nor not existing  causes and conditions bring about their birth . no  i   no doer  no recipient  yet good and bad karma never cease to function . beneath the buddha tree  you used your might to overpower the devil  gaining the sweet dew of nirvana  you won your way to enlightenment . already free of thought  perception  and volition  you refuted all the nonbuddhist doctrines . three times you turned the wheel of the law in the thousandmillionfold world  the wheel that from the first has always been pure . heavenly and human beings gained the waythis was proof of it  the three treasures thereupon appeared in the world . this wonderful law brought rescue to the many beings  embracing it  they never regress but dwell in constant quietude . great physician king  healer of old age  sickness and death  we pay homage to the boundless virtue of your dharma sea  unmoved by acclamation or abuse  like mount sumeru  you pity in equal measure the good and the not good . in mind and action impartial  like the empty sky who can hark to this jewel of humankind  not give respectful assent  now we offer these little parasols to the worldhonored one  and in them is revealed to us the three thousand worlds . palaces where gods  dragons  and spirits reside  kimnaras  yakshas  and all those other beings  everything that exists in the world we see the tenpowered one in pity manifests these transformations . the assembly  seeing this rare sight  all praise the buddha  now we bow our heads to the venerable one of the threefold world . great sage  dharma king  refuge of the multitude viewing the buddha with purified mind  none who do not rejoice  each sees the worldhonored one standing right before him such are the buddha s transcendental powers  his unshared properties . the buddha preaches the law with a single voice  but each living being understands it according to his kind . all believe the worldhonored one speaks the same words to all such are his transcendental powers  his unshared properties . the buddha preaches the law with a single voice  but each living being understands it in his own way . all undertake the buddha s practices and gain profit thereby such are his transcendental powers  his unshared properties . the buddha preaches the law with a single voice  but to some it brings fear  to others delight and joy some are moved to leave the world  some are freed of doubt such are his transcendental powers  his unshared properties . before the great diligence of the tenpowered one we bow our heads  we bow our heads to the fearlessness he has attained . we bow heads before the one who dwells in unshared properties  bow heads before the great leader of all beings . you can cut the thongs that bind the multitudewe bow heads to that  you crossed to the other shorewe bow heads to that . we bow heads to one who can save all those in this world  bow heads to one who long ago left the path of birth and death . you know the marks of all beings in their comings and goings  you have gained apt liberation from all phenomena . free of worldly attachments  like the lotus blossom  constantly you move within the realm of emptiness and quiet  you have mastered the marks of all phenomena  no blocks or hindrances  like the sky  you lean on nothingwe bow our heads  when the rich man s son  jeweled accumulation  had finished reciting these verses  he addressed the buddha  saying   worldhonored one  these five hundred sons of rich men have all set their minds on anuttarasamyaksambodhi . they wish to hear how one can purify the buddha lands.1 we beg the worldhonored one to explain the practices carried out by bodhisattvas in purifying the lands .  1 to  purify the buddha lands  here means to work diligently to lead the beings of various realms or buddha lands to enlightenment  which is one of the chief aims of the bodhisattva s activities . the buddha said   excellent  jeweled accumulation  for the sake of the bodhisattvas you do right to ask the thus come one about the practices for purifying the lands . listen well  listen well  and mull it over in your thoughts  i will now explain to you .  jeweled accumulation and the other five hundred sons of rich men then made ready to listen to the teachings addressed to them . the buddha said   jeweled accumulation  the various kinds of living beings are in themselves the buddha lands of the bodhisattvas . why so  because it is by converting various beings to the teachings that the bodhisattvas acquire their buddha lands . it is by persuading various beings and overcoming their objections that the bodhisattvas acquire their buddha lands . it is by inducing the various living beings to enter into the buddha wisdom in suchandsuch a land that they acquire their buddha lands . it is by inducing the various living beings to develop the capacity for bodhisattva practices in suchandsuch a land that they acquire their buddha lands .  why is this  because the bodhisattva s acquisition of a pure land is wholly due to his having brought benefit to living beings . suppose a man proposes to build a mansion on a plot of open land . he may do so as he wishes without hindrance . but if he tries to build it in the empty air  he will never be successful . it is the same with the bodhisattvas . it is because they wish to help others to achieve success that they take their vow to acquire buddha lands . their vow to acquire buddha lands in not founded on emptiness .  jeweled accumulation  you should understand that an upright mind is the pure land of the bodhisattva.2 when the bodhisattva attains buddhahood  then beings who are free of flattery will be born in his country . 2 the term chihhsin   upright mind   may also be translated  straightforward mind  or  direct mind .  in the paragraphs that follow  the term  pure land  is being used to mean a state of mind or course of action that allows a bodhisattva to create a buddha land that is pure in nature by leading others to enlightenment . the quality or action in the bodhisattva produces a similar state in the beings who are born in his land  for example  because he himself is honest and upright in mind  they are free from flattery or deviousness .  a deeply searching mind is the pure land of the bodhisattva . when he attains buddhahood  beings who are endowed with blessings will be born in his country .  a mind that aspires to bodhi or enlightenment is the pure land of the bodhisattva . when he attains buddhahood  beings dedicated to the great vehicle will be born in his country  almsgiving is the pure land of the bodhisattva . when he attains buddhahood  beings who are capable of casting away everything will be born in his country .  keeping of the precepts is the pure land of the bodhisattva . when he attains buddhahood  beings who fulfill their vow to carry out the ten good actions will be born in his country .  forbearance . is the pure land of the bodhisattva . when he attains buddhahood  beings who are adorned with the thirtytwo features will be born in his country .  assiduousness is the pure land of the bodhisattva . when he attains buddhahood  beings who strive diligently to acquire all manner of blessings will be born in his country  meditation is the pure land of the bodhisattva . when he attains buddhahood  beings who can regulate their minds and keep them from disorder will be born in his country .  wisdom is the pure land of the bodhisattva . when he attains buddhahood  beings who are correct and certain in understanding will be born in his country .  a mind devoted to the four immeasurable qualities is the pure land of the bodhisattva . when he attains buddhahood  beings perfect in the exercise of pity  compassion  joy  and indifference will be born in his country .  the four methods of winning people are the pure land of the bodhisattva . when he attains buddhahood  beings who are regulated by the emancipations will be born in his country .  expedient means are the pure land of the bodhisattva . when he attains buddhahood  beings who can employ all manner of expedient means with complete freedom will be born in his country .  the thirtyseven elements of the way are the pure land of the bodhisattva . when he attains buddhahood  beings will be born in his country who are proficient in the four states of mindfulness  the four types of correct effort  the four bases of supernatural power  the five roots of goodness  the five powers  the seven factors of enlightenment  and the eightfold holy path .  a mind intent on transferring merit to others is the pure land of the bodhisattva . when he attains buddhahood  he will acquire a country endowed with all manner of blessings .  teaching others to avoid the eight difficulties is the pure land of the bodhisattva . when he attains buddhahood  his country will be free of the three evils and the eight difficulties .  observing the precepts himself but not taxing others with their shortcomings is the pure land of the bodhisattva . when he attains buddhahood  no one in his country will be called a violater of prohibitions .  the ten good actions are the pure land of the bodhisattva . when he attains buddhahood  beings will be born in his country who suffer no untimely death  possess great wealth  are pure in action  sincere and truthful in word  ever mild in speech  never alienated from kin or associates  skillful in solving disputes  invariably speaking profitable words  never envious  never irate  and correct in understanding.3 3 each of the ten merits listed here results from the observance of one of the ten good actions .  therefore  jeweled accumulation  because the bodhisattva has an upright mind  he is impelled to action . because he is impelled to action  he gains a deeply searching mind . because he has a deeply searching mind  his will is well controlled . because his will is well controlled  he acts in accord with the teachings . because he acts in accord with the teachings  he can transfer merit to others . because he transfers merit to others  he knows how to employ expedient means . because he knows how to employ expedient means  he can lead others to enlightenment . because he leads others to enlightenment  his buddha land is pure . because his buddha land is pure  his preaching of the law is pure . because his preaching of the law is pure  his wisdom is pure . because his wisdom is pure  his mind is pure . and because his mind is pure  all the blessings he enjoys will be pure .  therefore  jeweled accumulation  if the bodhisattva wishes to acquire a pure land  he must purify his mind . when the mind is pure  the buddha land will be pure .  at that time shariputra  moved by the buddha s supernatural powers  thought to himself   if the mind of the bodhisattva is pure  then his buddha land will be pure . now when our worldhonored one first determined to become a bodhisattva  surely his intentions were pure . why then is this buddha land so filled with impurities   4 4 shariputra  one of the buddha s ten major disciples  customarily appears in the vimalakirti sutraus an expresser of doubts or expounder of erroneous views associated with hinayana teachings . but as indicated here  the buddha at times deliberately implants such doubts in shariputra s mind as a means of furthering the exposition of the doctrine . the buddha  knowing his thoughts  said to him   what do you think  are the sun and moon impure  is that why the blind man fails to see them   shariputra replied   no  worldhonored one . that is the fault of the blind man . the sun and moon are not to blame .   shariputra  it is the failings of living beings that prevent them from seeing the marvelous purity of the land of the buddha  the thus come one . the thus come one is not to blame . shariputra  this land of mine is pure  but you fail to see it .  at that time one of the brahma kings with his conchshaped tuft of hair said to shariputra   you must not think that this buddha land is impure . why do i say this  because to my eyes  shakyamuni s buddha land is as pure and spotless as the palace of the heavenly being great freedom .  shariputra said   when i look at this land  i see it full of knolls and hollows  thorny underbrush  sand and gravel  dirt  rocks  many mountains  filth and defilement .  the brahma king said   it is just that your mind has highs and lows and does not rest on buddha wisdom . therefore you see this land as impure . shariputra  the bodhisattva treats all things and beings  each one of them  with perfect equality . his deeply searching mind is pure  and because it rests on buddha wisdom  it can see the purity of this buddha land .  the buddha then pressed his toe against the earth  and immediately the thousandmillionfold world was adorned with hundreds and thousands of rare jewels  till it resembled jeweled adornment buddha s jeweled adornment land of immeasurible blessings . all the members of the great assembly sighed in wonder at what they had never seen before  and all saw that hey themselves were seated on jeweled lotuses . 5 5 that is  they perceived that they themselves were possessed of the buddha nature . the buddha said to shariputra   now do you see the marwelous purity of this buddha land   shariputra replied   indeed i do  worldhonored one . somehing i have never seen before  and never even heard ofnow all he marvelous purity of the buddha land is visible before me   the buddha said to shariputra   my buddha land has always been pure like this . but because i wish to save those persons who are lowly and inferior  i make it seem an impure land full of defilements  that is all . it is like the case of heavenly beings . all ate their food from the same precious vessel  but the food looks different for each one  depending upon the merits and virtues hat each possesses . it is the same in this case  shariputra . if a person s mind is pure  then he will see the wonderful blessings that adorn this land .  when the buddha in this way revealed the marvelous purity of the land  the five hundred sons of rich men who accompanied jeweled accumulation all were able to grasp the truth of birthlessness  and eightyfour thousand persons all set their minds on attaining anuttarasamyaksambodhi . the buddha then released the supernatural power that he had exercised with his toe and the world returned to its former appearance . thirtytwo thousand heavenly and human beings who wished to pursue the path of the voicehearer  understanding that all things are impermanent in nature  cast off the dust  removed themselves from defilement  and attained the pure dharma eye  and eight thousand monks  ceasing to accept the phenomenal world  put an end to all outflows and gained emancipation of mind . chapter 2 expedient means at that time in the great city of vaishali there was a rich man named vimalakirti . already in the past he had offered alms to immeasurable numbers of buddhas  had deeply planted the roots of goodness  and had grasped the truth of birthlessness . unhindered in his eloquence  able to disport himself with transcendental powers  he commanded full retention of the teachings and had attained the state of fearlessness . he had overcome the torments and ill will of the devil and entered deeply into the doctrine of the law  proficient in the paramita of wisdom and a master in the employing of expedient means . he had successfully fulfilled his great vow and could clearly discern how the minds of others were tending . moreover  he could distinguish whether their capacities were keen or obtuse . his mind was cleansed and purified through long practice of the buddha way  firm in its grasp of the great vehicle  and all his actions were well thought out and planned . he maintained the dignity and authority of a buddha  and his mind was vast as the sea . all the buddhas sighed with admiration  and he commanded the respect of the disciplies  of indra  brahma  and the four heavenly kings . desiring to save others  he employed the excellent expedient of residing in vaishali . his immeasurable riches he used to relieve the poor  his faultless observation of the precepts served as a reproach to those who would violate prohibitions . through his restraint and forbearance he warned others against rage and anger  and his great assiduousness discouraged all thought of sloth and indolence . concentrating his single mind in quiet meditation  he suppressed disordered thoughts  through firm and unwavering wisdom he overcame all that was not wise . l 1 this paragraph describes vimalakirti s practice of the six paramitas  for which see glossary . though dressed in the white robes of a layman  he observed all the rules of pure conduct laid down for monks  and though he lived at home  he felt no attachment to the threefold world . one could see he had a wife and children  yet he was at all times chaste in action  obviously he had kin and household attendants  yet he always delighted in withdrawing from them . although he wore jewels and finery  his real adornment was the auspicious marks  although he ate and drank like others  what he truly savored was the joy of meditation . if he visited the gambling parlors  it was solely to bring enlightenment to those there  if he listened to the doctrines of other religions  he did not allow them to impinge on the true faith . though well versed in secular writings  his constant delight was in the buddhist law . respected by everyone  he was looked on as foremost among those deserving of alms  embracing and upholding the correct dharma  he gave guidance to old and young . in a spirit of trust and harmony he conducted all kinds of business enterprises  but though he reaped worldly profits  he took no delight in these . he frequented the busy crossroads in order to bring benefit to others  entered the government offices and courts of law so as to aid and rescue all those he could . he visited the places of debate in order to guide others to the great vehicle  visited the schools and study halls to further the instruction of the pupils . he entered houses of ill fame to teach the folly of fleshly desire  entered wine shops in order to encourage those with a will to quit them . if he was among rich men  they honored him as foremost among them because he preached the superior law for them . if he was among lay believers  they honored him as foremost because he freed them from greed and attachment . among kshatriyas he was most highly honored because he taught them forbearance . among brahmans he was most highly honored because he rid them of their selfconceit . the great ministers honored him as foremost because he taught the correct law . the princes honored him as foremost because he showed them how to be loyal and filial . within the women s quarters he was most honored because he converted and brought refinement to the women of the harem . the common people honored him as first among them because he helped them to gain wealth and power . the brahma deities honored him as first among them because he revealed the superiority of wisdom . the indras honored him as first among them because he demonstrated the truth of impermanence . the four heavenly kings  guardians of the world  honored him as foremost because he guarded all living beings . in this way the rich man vimalakirti employed immeasurable numbers of expedient means in order to bring benefit to others . using these expedient means  he made it appear that his body had fallen prey to illness . because of his illness  the king of the country  the great ministers  rich men  lay believers  and brahmans  as well as the princes and lesser officials  numbering countless thousands  all went to see him and inquire about his illness . vimalakirti then used this bodily illness to expound the law to them in broad terms   good people  this body is impermanent  without durability  without strength  without firmness  a thing that decays in a moment  not to be relied on . it suffers  it is tormented  a meeting place of manifold ills .  good people  no person of enlightened wisdom could depend on a thing like this body this body is like a cluster of foam  nothing you can grasp or handle . this body is like a bubble that can not continue for long . this body is like a flame born of longing and desire . this body is like the plantain that has no firmness in its trunk . this body is like a phantom  the product of error and confusion . this body is like a dream  compounded of false and empty visions . this body is like a shadow  appearing through karma causes . this body is like an echo  tied to causes and conditions . this body is like a drifting cloud  changing and vanishing in an instant . this body is like lightning  barely lasting from moment to moment .  this body is like earth that has no subjective being . this body is like fire  devoid of ego . this body is like wind that has no set life span . this body is like water  devoid of individuality .  this body has no reality but makes these four elements its lodging . this body is void  removed from self and self s possessions . this body is without understanding  like plants or trees  tiles or pebbles . this body is without positive action  blown about by the wind . this body is impure  crammed with defilement and evil . this body is empty and unreal  though for a time you may bathe and cleanse  clothe and feed it  in the end it must crumble and fade . this body is plagueridden  beset by a hundred and one ills and anxieties . this body is like the abandoned well on the hillside  old age pressing in on it . this body has no fixity  but is destined for certain death . this body is like poisonous snakes  vengeful bandits  or an empty village  a mere coming together of components  realms  and sensefields .  good people  a thing like  this is irksome and hateful  and therefore you should seek the buddha body . why  because the buddha body is the dharma body . it is born from immeasurable merits and wisdom . it is born from precepts  meditation  wisdom  emancipation  and the insight of emancipation . it is born from pity  compassion  joy  and indifference . it is born of the various paramitas such as almsgiving  keeping of the precepts  forbearance and gentleness  assiduousness in religious practice  meditation  emancipation and samadhi  wide knowledge and wisdom . it is born of expedient means  born of the six transcendental powers  born of the three understandings  born of the thirtyseven elements of the way  born of concentration and insight  born of the ten powers  the four kinds of fearlessness  and the eighteen unshared properties . it is born of the cutting off of all things not good and the gathering in of all good things  born of the truth  born of the avoidance of indulgence and laxity . the body of the thus come one is born of immeasurable numbers of pure and spotless things such as these .  good people  if you wish to gain the buddha body and do away with the ills that afflict all living beings  then you must set your minds on attaining anuttarasamyaksambodhi .  in this manner the rich man vimalakirti used the occasion to preach the law to those who came to inquire about his illness . as a result  numberless thousands of persons were all moved to set their minds on the attainment of anuttarasamyaksambodhi . chapter 3 the disciples at that time the rich man vimalakirti thought to himself   i am lying here sick in bed . why does the worldhonored one in his great compassion fail to show some concern for me   the buddha  aware of this thought  said to shariputra   you must go visit vimalakirti and inquire about his illness .  but shariputra replied to the buddha in these words   worldhonored one  i am not competent to visit him and inquire about his illness . why  because i recall one occasion in the past when i was sitting in quiet meditation under a tree in the forest .  at that time vimalakirti approached and said to me  ah  shariputra  you should not assume that this sort of sitting is true quiet sitting  quiet sitting means that in this threefold world you manifest neither body nor will . this is quiet sitting . not rising out of your samadhi of complete cessation and yet showing yourself in the ceremonies of daily lifethis is quiet sitting . not abandoning the principles of the way and yet showing yourself in the activities of a common mortalthis is quiet sitting . your mind not fixed on internal things and yet not engaged with externals eitherthis is quiet sitting . unmoved by sundry theories  but practicing the thirtyseven elements of the waythis is quiet sitting . entering nirvana without having put an end to earthly desiresthis is quiet sitting . if you can do this kind of sitting  you will merit the buddha s seal of approval .   at that time  worldhonored one  when i heard him speak these words  i remained silent  for i had no way to reply to them . that is why i am not competent to visit him and inquire about his illness .  the buddha then said to maudgalyayana   you must go visit vimalakirti and inquire about his illness .  but maudgalyayana replied to the buddha   worldhonored one  i am not competent to visit him and inquire about his illness . why  because i recall how in the past i entered the great city of vaishali and in its streets and lanes expounded the dharma for the lay believers .  at that time vimalakirti approached and said to me  ah  maudgalyayana  when you expound the dharma for the whiterobed lay believers  you should not expound it the way you are doing  expounding the dharma should be done in accordance with the dharma  reality  itself .  the dharma knows nothing of living beings  because it is removed from the defilement of such concepts as  living beings .  the dharma knows nothing of  i   because it is removed from the defilement of such concepts as  i .  it knows nothing of a life span  because it knows nothing of birth and death . it knows nothing of individuality  because it is cut off from considerations of past or future lives . the dharma is forever still and serene  because it has wiped out all characteristics . the dharma is without characteristics  because it is without anything that can be perceived . the dharma is without names or appellations  because it is cut off from all language . the dharma is without any expounding  because it is removed from broad or minute contemplation by the mind . the dharma is without forms or characteristics  because it is as though vacant and empty . the dharma is not the subject of frivolous theories  because in the end it is empty . the dharma is without the concept of  mine   because it is removed from all such concepts of personal possession . the dharma is without distinctions  because it is apart from all types of consciousness . the dharma has nothing it can compare to  because there is no entity that can be set beside it .  the dharma is not affected by causes  because it does not exist in a conditioned realm . the dharma is identical with the dharmanature  because it enters into all phenomena  dharmas  . the dharma conforms with what is truly so  because there is nothing else to conform to . the dharma abides in the locus of reality  being unaffected by anything on the periphery . the dharma is without motion or wavering  never depending on the six sense objects . the dharma is without coming or going  since it never abides anywhere to begin with .  the dharma accords with emptiness  follows what is formless  responds to what is actionless . the dharma is separate from beautiful or ugly . the dharma knows no increase or diminution  the dharma knows no birth or extinction  the dharma knows no destination . the dharma transcends eyes  ears  nose  tongue  body  and mind . the dharma knows no high or low . the dharma constantly abides without moving . the dharma is separate from all meditational practices .  ah  maudgalyayana  since the characteristics of the dharma are such as these  how can one expound it  expounding the dharma means no expounding  no demonstrating  and listening to the dharma means no listening  no grasping . it is like a conjurer of phantoms expounding the dharma for phantom persons . it is with this understanding that you should expound the dharma .  you should take into account that some living beings are keen in capacity while others are dull  cultivate the kind of skilled insight that is free from all impediment  with a mind steeped in great compassion praise the great vehicle  and remember the debt of gratitude you owe the buddha  never allowing the three treasures to come to an end . when you have done all this  then you may expound the dharma .   when vimalakirti expounded the dharma in this way  eight hundred lay believers set their minds on the attainment of anuttarasamyaksambodhi . i possess no such eloquence as this . therefore i say that i am not competent to visit him and inquire about his illness .  the buddha then said to mahakashyapa   you must go visit vimalakirti and inquire about his illness .  but mahakashyapa replied to the buddha   worldhonored one  i am not competent to visit him and inquire about his illness . why  because i recall how in the past i was begging for alms in a poor village .  at that time vimalakirti approached and said to me  ah  mahakashyapa  you have a mind marked by compassion and pity  but you do not know how to apply it to all alike . instead you shun the rich and mighty and beg alms among the poor .  mahakashyapa  you must abide by the principle of equanimity and in that spirit go about begging for food . because in the end there is no such thing as eating  in that spirit one goes about begging for food . because one wishes to destroy dependence on things characterized by a mere combination of elements  in that spirit one accepts these balls of foodstuff . because in the end there is no receiving  in that spirit one receives this food .  when you enter a village  think of it as an empty village . the forms you see there should appear as they would to a blind man  the sounds you hear should be mere echoes . the aromas you inhale should be so much thin air  the flavors you taste should be undifferentiated .  accept all sensations in accordance with the enlightenment of wisdom  and understand that all phenomena are no more than phantom forms . they have no intrinsic nature  nor do they take on any other nature . l 1 or  according to another interpretation   intrinsically they have never been on fire  and hence will never burn out .  the character jan can mean either  so   or  thus   or  to burn .   mahakashyapa  if  without casting aside the eight errors  you can enter into the eight emancipations  if  while possessing the marks of error  you can enter the correct law  if with one meal you can feed all beings  offering alms to the buddhas and the sages and worthy persons  then after that you may eat your food .  one who eats in this manner neither possesses earthly desires nor is separated from earthly desires  neither enters into a meditative state of mind nor arises out of such a state  neither dwells in this world nor dwells in nirvana .  one who gives alms in this manner derives neither great fortune nor little fortune  neither profit nor loss . this is the correct way to enter the buddha way without relying on the path of the voicehearer .  mahakashyapa  if you can eat your food in this manner  then you will not be eating in vain the food that others give you .   at that time  worldhonored one  when i heard him speak these words  i gained what i had never had before  and i was inspired with a profound respect for all the bodhisattvas . and i thought to myself  if this householder possesses such eloquence and wisdom that he can speak like this  then who could listen to him without being moved to set his mind on the attainment of anuttarasamyaksambodhi   from that time on i ceased to urge others to follow the path of the voicehearer or the pratyekabuddha . that is why i say i am not competent to visit him and inquire about his illness .  the buddha then said to subhuti   you must go visit vimalakirti and inquire about his illness .  but subhuti replied to the buddha   worldhonored one  i am not competent to visit him and ask about his illness . why  because i recall how in the past i went to his house to beg alms .  at that time vimalakirti took my begging bowl  filled it with things  to eat  and said  ah  subhuti  if one can look on all foods as equal  that person can look on all things as equal  and if one looks on all things as equal  one will look on all foods as equal . if one begs alms in this manner  then one is worthy to receive food .  subhuti  if you can not cut yourself off from lewdness  anger  and stupidity and yet not be a part of these  if you can refrain from destroying the idea of a self and yet see all things as of a single nature  if without wiping out stupidity and attachment you can find your way to understanding and freedom from attachment  if you can seem to be a perpetrator of the five cardinal sins and yet gain emancipation  if you can be neither unbound nor bound  neither one who has perceived the four noble truths nor one who has not perceived them  neither one who obtains the fruits of religious practice nor one who does not obtain them  neither a common mortal nor one who has removed himself from the ways of the common mortal  neither a sage nor not a sageif in this manner you can master all phenomenal things and yet remove yourself from the ways that mark them  then you will be worthy to receive food .  subhuti  if without seeing the buddha or listening to his law you are willing to take those six heretical teachers  purana kashyapa  maskarin goshaliputra  samjayin vairatiputra  ajita keshakambala  kakuda katyayana  and nirgrantha jnatiputra  as your teachers  leave the household life because of them  and follow them in falling into the same errors they fall into  then you will be worthy to receive food .  subhuti  if you can subscribe to erroneous views and thus never reach the  other shore  of enlightenment  if you can remain among the eight difficulties and never escape from difficulty  and can make common cause with earthly desires and remove yourself from a state of purity  if when you attain the samadhi of nondisputation you allow all living beings to attain the same degree of concentration  if those who give you alms are not destined to gain good fortune thereby  and those who make offerings to you fall into the three evil paths of existence  if you are willing to join hands with the host of devils and make the defilements your companion  if you can be no different from all these devils and these dusts and defilements  if you can bear hatred toward all living beings  slander the buddhas  vilify the law  not be counted among the assembly of monks  and in the end never attain nirvanaif you can do all this  then you will be worthy to receive food .   at that time  worldhonored one  when i heard these words  i was dumbfounded  not knowing what sort of words they were or how to answer them . i put down my alms bowl  intending to leave the house  but vimalakirti said to me  ah  subhuti  pick up your alms bowl and do not be afraid . why do i say this  if some phantom person conjured up by the thus come one were to reprimand you as i have just done  you would not be afraid  would you    no   i replied .  vimalakirti said  all things in the phenomenal world are just such phantoms and conjured beings . so you have no cause to feel afraid . why  because all words and pronouncements too are no different from these other phantom forms . when a person is wise  he does not cling to words and hence is not afraid of them . why  because words are something apart from selfnaturewords do not really exist . and this is emancipation . all things of the phenomenal world bear this mark of emancipation .   when vimalakirti expounded the law in this manner  two hundred heavenly beings gained the purity of the dharma eye . therefore i say i am not competent to visit him and ask about his illness .  the buddha then said to purna maitrayaniputra   you must go visit vimalakirti and ask about his illness .  but purna said to the buddha   worldhonored one  i am not competent to visit him and ask about his illness . why  because i recall how once  under a tree in the great forest  i was expounding the law to some monks who had just begun their study of the way .  at that time vimalakirti approached and said to me  ah  purna  you should first enter into meditation and observe a person s mind before expounding the law to that person . one does not put rotten food in a precious vessel . you must determine what thoughts are in the minds of these monks . do not treat precious lapis lazuli as though it were mere glass   you seem unable to understand the basic capacities of living beings . you must not try to rouse their aspirations by preaching the doctrines of the lesser vehicle . do not inflict injury on those who are without wounds  if you want them to travel the great highway  do not show them a little bypath . do not try to fit the vast ocean into an ox s hoofprint  do not regard the light of the sun as if it were a firefly s glimmer   purna  these monks long ago set their minds on the great vehicle  but later they forgot their original intentions . why do you use the doctrines of the lesser vehicle to teach and guide them  as i see it  the wisdom of the lesser vehicle is trite and shallow  like the understanding of a blind person . it is incapable of discerning whether the capacities of living beings are keen or dull .   at that time vimalakirti entered into samadhi  making it possible for these monks to become aware of their former existences . in the past  under five hundred buddhas  they had planted the roots of virtue and set their minds on the attainment of anuttarasamyaksambodhi . and at that moment they were suddenly able to regain their original spirit of resolve . with that  the monks bowed their heads at vimalakirti s feet . then he preached the law for them  insuring that they would never again regress in their striving for anuttarasamyaksambodhi . and i thought to myself that a voicehearer should never preach the law when he can not discern people s inner capacities . therefore i say i am not competent to visit vimalakirti and inquire about his illness .  the buddha then said to mahakatyayana   you must go visit vimalakirti and ask about his illness .  but mahakatyayana said to the buddha   worldhonored one  i am not competent to visit him and ask about his illness . why  because i recall how in the past the buddha was once summing up for the monks the essential points in his preaching of the law later  i expounded and elaborated on what he had said  discussing the meaning of the terms impermanence  suffering  emptiness  nonego  and tranquil extinction or nirvana .  at that time vimalakirti approached and said to me  ah  mahakatyayana  you must not try to expound on the true nature of phenomena when your mind is concerned with distinctions such as birth or extinction . for in the end all phenomeria know neither birth nor extinctionthis is the meaning of impermanence . the five components are wide open  empty  nothing arising in themthis is the meaning of suffering . the various phenomena ultimately have no existencethis is the meaning of emptiness . ego and nonego are not two different thingsthis is the meaning of nonego . phenomena have never been  so  to begin with  and hence will never cease to be  so  2this is the meaning of tranquil extinction .  2 or  according to another interpretation   things have never been on fire to begin with  so they can not go out now .  see note 1 in this chapter .  when he expounded the law in this way  the minds of the monks were able to gain emancipation . that is why i say i am not competent to visit vimalakirti and ask about his illness .  the buddha then said to aniruddha   you must go visit vimalakirti and ask about his illness .  but aniruddha said to the buddha   worldhonored one  i am not competent to visit him and ask about his illness . why  because i recall how once i was walking around to stretch my legs when a brahma king named austere purity  accompanied by ten thousand brahmas  all emitting beams of pure light  came to the place where i was . bowing his head in obeisance  he questioned me  saying  aniruddha  how far can this divine eye of yours see  3 3 aniruddha was known among the ten major disciples as foremost in divine sight .  i replied  sir  i can see this whole thousandmillionfold world  the buddha land of shakyamuni  as though i were peering down at a myrobalan fruit in the palm of my hand .   at that time vimalakirti approached and said to me  ah  aniruddha  this sight possessed by the divine eyeis it conditioned in nature  or is it unconditioned  if it is conditioned in nature  then it is the same as the five transcendental powers of the nonbuddhist teachers . and if it is unconditioned  then it is uncreated  and hence is incapable of seeing anything .   at that time i remained silent . but the brahmas  hearing his words  gained what they had never had before . at once they made obeisance to him and said  in this world  who possesses the true divine eye    vimalakirti replied  only the buddha  the worldhonored one  is able to acquire the true divine eye . he is constantly in a state of samadhi and can see all the buddha lands  because he does not see in terms of duality .   thereupon the brahma king austere purity and his retinue of five hundred brahma deities all set their minds on the attainment of anuttarasamyaksambodhi . they bowed at vimalakirti s feet and then suddenly were seen no more . therefore i say i am not competent to visit vimalakirti and ask about his illness .  the buddha then said to upali   you must go visit vimalakirti and ask about his illness .  but upali replied to the buddha   worldhonored one  i am not competent to visit him and ask about his illness . why  because i recall once in the past when two monks had violated the rules of conduct and were feeling ashamed of themselves but did not dare ask the buddha what to do . so they came to me and said  ah  upali  we have violated the precepts and are truly ashamed  but we do not dare ask the buddha what to do . please free us from our doubts and remorse and tell us how we can be excused from blame . 4 4 upali was known as foremost in observing the precepts .  i explained to them how one goes about gaining pardon according to the law but at that time vimalakirti approached and said to me  ah  upali  do not make the offense these monks have committed even worse than it is  you should go about wiping out their doubts and remorse at once and not trouble their minds further   why do i say this  because their offense by its nature does not exist either inside them  or outside  or in between . as the buddha has taught us  when the mind is defiled  the living being will be defiled . when the mind is pure  the living being will be pure . as the mind is  so will be the offense or defilement . the same is true of all things  for none escape the realm of suchness .  now  upali  if one gains emancipation from delusion through an understanding of the nature of the mind  does any defilement remain    no   i replied .  vimalakirti said  in the same way  when all living beings gain an understanding of the nature of the mind  then no defilement exists . ah  upali  deluded thoughts are defilement . where there are no deluded thoughts  that is purity . topsyturvy thinking is defilement . where there is no topsyturvy thinking  that is purity . belief in the self is defilement . where there is no such belief  that is purity .  upali  all phenomena are born and pass into extinction  never enduring  like phantoms  like lightning . they do not wait for one another or linger for an instant . all phenomena are the product of deluded vision  like dreams  like flames  like the moon in the water or an image in a mirror  born of deluded thoughts . one who understands this is called a keeper of the precepts  one who understands this is called well liberated .   at this  the two monks exclaimed  superlative wisdom  upali could never match this  he who is  foremost in observing the precepts  could never speak like this   and i added  leaving the thus come one aside  no voicehearer or bodhisattva has ever commanded such eloquence in apt exposition . see how clear and penetrating his wisdom is    at that time the doubts and remorse of the two monks were wiped away and they set their minds on the attainment of anuttarasamyaksambodhi  vowing that we will enable all living beings to gain eloquence such as this   therefore i say i am not competent to visit vimalakirti and ask about his illness .  the buddha then said to rahula   you must go visit vimalakirti and ask about his illness .  but rahula said to the buddha   worldhonored one  i am not competent to visit him and ask about his illness . why  because i recall how once in the past the sons of the wealthy men of vaishali came to the place where i was  bowed their heads in obeisance  and questioned me . ah  rahula   they said  you are the buddha s son  but you cast aside your claim to the rank of a wheelturning king and left the household life to become a monk . what benefits does one acquire by leaving the household life    i explained to them the benefits and blessings one gains by leaving the household life as the law describes them . but at that time vimalakirti approached and said to me  ah  rahula  you should not speak of the benefits and blessings gained by leaving the household life . why  because to be without benefits and without blessings is to leave household life .  in the case of things that are conditioned in nature one may speak of them as having benefits and blessings . but one who leaves household life enters the realm of the unconditioned  and in the realm of the unconditioned there are no benefits  no blessings .  rahula  leaving the household life is not that  not this  and not in between . it means abandoning the sixtytwo erroneous views to reside in nirvana  it is accepted by the wise and carried out by the sages . it means conquering and subduing the host of devils  moving beyond the five realms of existence  purifying the five eyes  acquiring the five powers  and cultivating the five roots of goodness . it means not troubling others but removing oneself from sundry evils  refuting the nonbuddhist doctrines  transcending the realm of makeshift names  shaking off mud and defilement . it is without ties or attachments  without personal possessions  without thought of possessions  without fluster or confusion . it means harboring joy within  guarding the minds of others  pursuing the practice of meditation  and freeing oneself from all fault . if one can do all this  then one has truly left the household .   then vimalakirti addressed the rich men s sons  saying  now that you are in the midst of the correct law  you should all join in leaving the household life . why  because it is rare to happen on a time when the buddha is in the world    but the rich men s sons said  layman  we have heard the buddha say that one must not leave the household life without the permission of one s parents .   in that case  you should set your minds on attaining anuttarasamyaksambodhi   said vimalakirti . that is the same as leaving the household  the same as taking monastic vows .   at that time thirtytwo rich men s sons all set their minds on attaining anuttarasamyaksambodhi . therefore i say i am not competent to visit vimalakirti and ask about his illness .  the buddha then said to ananda   you must go visit vimalakirti and ask about his illness .  but ananda said to the buddha   worldhonored one  i am not competent to visit him and ask about his illness . why  because i recall once in the past when the worldhonored one was feeling somewhat ill and needed some cow s milk . i at once took my begging bowl  went to the home of one of the great brahmans  and stood by the gate . at that time vimalakirti approached and said to me  ah  ananda  what are you doing standing here early in the morning with your begging bowl    i replied  layman  the worldhonored one is suffering from a slight bodily illness and needs some cow s milk . that s why i ve come here .   but vimalakirti said  hush  hush  ananda  never speak such words  the body of the thus come one is diamondhard in substance . all evils have been cut away  manifold good things gather there . how could it know illness  how could it know distress  go your way in silence  ananda  and do not defame the thus come one . do nt let others hear you speaking such coarse words  do nt let these heavenly beings of great majesty and virtue and these bodhisattvas who have come from the pure lands of other regions hear such utterances   ananda  even a wheelturning sage king with his few blessings is still able to exempt himself from illness . how much more so  then  the thus come one  in whom immeasurable blessings meet  the surpasser of all  be on your way  ananda  and do not inflict this shame on us .  if the nonbuddhists and brahmans should hear such talk they would think to themselves   why call this man teacher  he can not save himself from illness  so how could he save others from their illnesses   slip away quickly now so no one will hear what you have said   ananda  you should know that the body of the thus come one is the dharma body  not the body of the world of thought and desires . the buddha is the worldhonored one who transcends the threefold world . the buddha body is free of outflows  for all its outflows have been cut off . the buddha body is unconditioned and does not fall within the realm of destinies . a body such as thishow could it know illness  how could it know distress    at that time  worldhonored one  i felt truly ashamed and thought  i must go to the buddha and ask if i heard him incorrectly . but at that moment i heard a voice in the sky saying  ananda  it is as the layman has said . but the buddha has appeared in this evil world of five impurities and at present is practicing the law so as to save and liberate living beings . go  ananda  get the milk and do not feel ashamed    but  worldhonored one  vimalakirti commands such wisdom and eloquence as this  that is why i say i am not competent to visit him and ask about his illness .  thus all five hundred of the major disciples one by one described to the buddha some earlier experience and the words that vimalakirti had spoken on that occasion  each declaring   i am not competent to visit him and ask about his illness .  chapter 4 the bodhisattvas the buddha then said to the bodhisattva maitreya   you must go visit vimalakirti and inquire about his illness .  but maitreya replied to the buddha   worldhonored one  i am not competent to visit him and inquire about his illness . why  because i recall how once in the past i was preaching to the king of the tushita heaven and his followers on the practices required to attain the state of nonregression .  at that time vimalakirti approached and said to me  maitreya  the worldhonored one prophesied that with one more birth you will be able to attain anuttarasamyaksambodhi . now just what birth does this prophecy apply to  does it apply to your past birth  your future birth  or your present birth   if it applies to a past birth  that past birth has already passed into extinction . if it applies to a future birth  that future birth has yet to arrive . and if it applies to a present birth  this present birth lacks permanence . for  as the buddha has said   monks  one moment you are born  the next you grow old  the next you pass into extinction .   or does the prophecy apply to the state of birthlessness  but birthlessness is none other than the state of correct realization  and the stage of correct realization can have nothing to do with prophecies of enlightenment or with the attainment of anuttarasamyaksambodhi . so how  maitreya  can you be given this prophecy about  one birth    were you given this prophecy because of some birth that pertains to suchness  or were you given this prophecy because of some extinction that pertains to suchness  if you were given this prophecy because of some birth that pertains to suchness  you should know that in suchness there is no birth . and if you were given this prophecy because of some extinction that pertains to suchness  you should know that in suchness there is no extinction .  all living beings are a part of suchness  and all other things as well are a part of suchness . the sages and worthy ones too are a part of suchness  even you  maitreya  are a part of suchness . so if you have been given a prophecy of enlightenment  then all living beings should likewise be given such a prophecy . why  because suchness knows no dualism or differentiation . if you  maitreya  are able to attain anuttarasamyaksambodhi  then all living beings should likewise be able to attain it . why  because all living beings in truth bear the marks of bodhi . if you  maitreya  are able to gain nirvana  then all living beings should likewise be able to gain it . why  because the buddhas know that all living beings bear the marks of tranquil extinction  which is nirvana  and that there is no further extinction . therefore  maitreya  you must not use doctrines such as this to mislead these offspring of the gods . for in truth there is no such thing as setting one s mind on the attainment of anuttarasamyaksambodhi or of attaining the state of nonregression .  maitreya  you should persuade these offspring of the gods to abandon any view that makes distinctions concerning bodhi . why  because bodhi is not something that can be acquired by the body  or acquired by the mind .  tranquil extinction is bodhi  for in it all marks become extinct . noncontemplation is bodhi  for it is divorced from all causes . nonaction is bodhi  for it is devoid of thought and mental activity cutting off is bodhi  for it abandons all views . removal is bodhi  for it means the removal of all deluded thoughts .  blocking is bodhi  because it blocks out all aspiration . noninvolvement is bodhi  because it is without greed or attachment . compliance is bodhi  because it complies with suchness . abiding is bodhi  because it abides in the dharmanature .  extending is bodhi  for it extends to the limit of reality . nonduality is bodhi  for it is removed from thoughts and thought objects . equality is bodhi  for in it all is equally empty and void . the unconditioned is bodhi  for it knows no birth  abiding  or extinction . understanding is bodhi  for it fully comprehends the mental activities of living beings .  nonengagement is bodhi  because it enters into no kind of engagement with objects . nonparticipation is bodhi  because it has freed itself from the habits of earthly desire . the dwellingless is bodhi  because it lacks shape or form . the provisionally named is bodhi  because names and words are void .  phantomlike is bodhi  for it neither grasps nor lets go . untroubled is bodhi  for it is forever still of itself . good tranquillityl is bodhi  for it is pure in nature . ungrasping is bodhi  for it is removed from distracting causes . nondifferentiation is bodhi  for in it all phenomena are equal . incomparable is bodhi  for no simile can convey it . subtle and wonderful is bodhi  for phenomena are hard to understand .   worldhonored one  when vimalakirti expounded the law in this fashion  two hundred offspring of the gods were able to grasp the truth of birthlessness . therefore i say i am not competent to visit him and ask about his illness .  the buddha then said to the bodhisattva shining adornment  a young boy   you must go visit vimalakirti and ask about his illness .  but shining adornment replied to the buddha   worldhonored one  i am not competent to visit him and inquire about his illness . why  because i remember once in the past when i was leaving the great city of vaishali . vimalakirti was just then entering the city  and i accordingly bowed to him and said  layman  where are you coming from    he replied  i am coming from the place of practice .  1 some texts read  the tranquillity of meditation .   the place of practicewhere is that   i asked .  he replied  an upright mind is the place of practice  for it is without sham or falsehood . the resolve to act is the place of practice  for it can judge matters properly . a deeply searching mind is the place of practice  for it multiplies benefits . the mind that aspires to bodhi is the place of practice  for it is without error or misconception .  almsgiving is the place of practice  because it hopes for no reward . observance of the precepts is the place of practice  because it brings fulfillment of vows . forbearance is the place of practice  because it enabjes one to view all living beings with a mind free of obstruction . assiduousness is the place of practice  because it forestalls laziness and regression . meditation is the place of practice  because it makes the mind tame and gentle . wisdom is the place of practice  because it sees all things as they are .  pity is the place of practice  for it views all living beings equally . compassion is the pjace of practice  for it bears up under weariness and pain . joy is the place of practice  for it revels in dharma delight . indifference is the place of practice  for it rejects both hatred and love .  transcendental powers are the place of practice  because thereby one masters the six powers . emancipation is the place of practice  because it knows how to renounce and set aside . expedient means are the place of practice  because they can teach and convert living beings . the four methods of winning people are the place of practice  because they can win living beings over . much learning is the place of practice  because one carries out what one has learned . a disciplined mind is the place of practice  because one can thereby contempjate all phenomena correctly the thirtyseven elements of the way are the place of practice  because through them  one rejects what is conditioned . truth2 is the place of practice  because it does not deceive the world . 2 some texts read  the four noble truths .   causes and conditions are the place of practice  for none of the links in the chain of causation  from ignorance to old age and death  ever come to an end . earthly desires are the place of practice  for through them we know the nature of suchness . living beings are the place of practice  for through them we know that there is no ego . all phenomena are the place of practice  for through them we know the emptiness of all phenomena .  conquering devils is the place of practice  because one is unswayed  unflinching . the threefold world is the place of practice  because there is no path for one there . the lion s roar is the place of practice  because it has nothing it fears . the ten powers  the four kinds of fearlessness  the eighteen unshared properties are the place of practice  because they are free of all fault . the three understandings are the place of practice  because they are without the least obstruction . understanding all phenomena in one instant of thought is the place of practice  because one thereby becomes master of all wisdom .  my good fellow  if bodhisattvas apply themselves to the paramitas and teach and convert living beings  then you should understand that everything they do  every lifting of a foot  every placing of a foot  will in effect be a  coming from the place of practice   an abiding in the buddha s law .   when vimalakirti preached the law in this manner  five hundred heavenly and human beings all set their minds on attaining anuttarasamyaksambodhi . therefore i say i am not competent to visit him and ask about his illness .  the buddha then said to the bodhisattva upholder of the age   you must go visit vimalakirti and ask about his illness .  but upholder of the age said to the buddha   worldhonored one  i am not competent to visit him and inquire about his illness . why  because i recall once when i was staying in my quiet room . at that time the devil king papiyas  accompanied by twelve thousand heavenly maidens  appeared in the guise of the god indra . playing on musical instruments and singing  they came to where i was  and then the devil and his retinue bowed their heads at my feet  pressed their palms together  and stood to one side .  i thought it was indra  and i said to him  welcome  kaushika.3 though you enjoy good fortune  you should never behave willfully . you should contemplate the impermanence of the five desires and strive thereby to plant good roots . with body  life  and resources you should cultivate the steadfast law .   but indra said to me  upright one  please accept these twelve thousand heavenly maidens . they can serve and wait on you .   i replied  kaushika  a monk  a son of shakyamuni  has no use for unlawful things such as these . it would not be right for me to accept them .   before i had finished speaking  vimalakirti approached and said to me  this is not indra . this is only a devil who has come tã³ trouble and vex you .  then he said to the devil  you may give these women to me . it is quite all right for me to accept them .   the devil was alarmed and fearful  thinking that vimalakirti was perhaps going to make trouble for him . he tried to hide himself and escape  but he could not make himself invisible . though he exhausted all his supernatural powers  he could not get away  just then a voice was heard in the sky saying  papiyas  give him the women . then you can escape .   the devil  terrified  looked this way and that and then handed over the women . vimalakirti then addressed the women  saying  the devil has given you to me . now it is proper that you should all set your minds on attaining anuttarasamyaksambodhi .   then  adopting whatever approach was appropriate  he expounded the law to them  awakening in them a desire for the way . then he said  nã³w that you have conceived a desire for the way  you may regale yourselves with dharma delight and need no longer delight in the pleasures of the five desires .  3 kaushika is another name for indra .  the heavenly maidens asked  what is this you call dharma delight    vimalakirti replied  to delight in constant faith in the buddha  to delight in the desire to hear the law  to delight in giving alms to the assembly  to delight in casting off the five desires  to delight in viewing the five components as vengeful bandits  to delight in viewing the four great elements as poisonous snakes  to delight in viewing the mind and the senses as an empty village  to delight in pursuing and guarding a desire for the way  to delight in benefiting living beings  to delight in honoring and supporting teachers  to delight in practicing widespread generosity  to delight in strict observance of the precepts  to delight in patience  humility  gentleness  and harmony  to delight in diligently amassing good roots  to delight in meditation that is never disordered  to delight in bright  undefiled wisdom  to delight in broadening the mind that aspires to bodhi  to delight in conquering and subduing devils  to delight in cutting off all earthly desires  to delight in purifying the buddha lands  to delight in gaining merits so that one may in time succeed in acquiring auspicious marks and characteristics  to delight in adorning the place of practice  to delight in listening fearlessly to profound teachings  to delight in the three gates to emancipation and not to delight in untimely teachings  to delight in being friendly with those of like learning  to delight in a mind free of anger and hostility when among those of unlike learning  to delight in guiding and protecting evil friends  to delight in being friendly with good friends  to delight in a mind that finds joy in purity  to delight in practicing the teachings regarding the immeasurable elements of the waythese make up the dharma delight of the bodhisattva .   papiyas then addressed the women  saying  i want now to return with you to my heavenly palace .  but the women said  you gave us to this layman . possessing this dharma delight that affords us such pleasure  we no longer delight in the pleasures of the five desires .   the devil said  layman  you should give up these women . he who gives all he possesses as a gift to others is a bodhisattva .   vimalakirti replied  i have already given them up . you may take them away  and may you enable all living beings to fulfill their desire for the dharma    but the women said to vimalakirti  how can we remain in the palace of the devil    vimalakirti replied  sisters  there is a teaching called the inexhaustible lamp . you must study it . this inexhaustible lamp is like a single lamp that lights a hundred or a thousand other lamps  till the darkness is all made bright with a brightness that never ends . in this same way  sisters  one bodhisattva guides and opens a path for a hundred or a thousand living beings  causing them to set their minds on attaining anuttarasamyaksambodhi . and this desire for the way will never be extinguished or go out . by following the teaching as it has been preached  one keeps adding until one has acquired all good teachings . this is what is called the inexhaustible lamp .  although you live in the palace of the devil  with this inexhaustible lamp you can enable countless heavenly sons and heavenly daughters to set their minds on attaining anuttarasamyaksambodhi . thus you will repay the debt of gratitude you owe the buddha and at the same time bring great benefit to all living beings .   at that time the heavenly maidens bowed their heads at vimalakirti s feet and then accompanied the devil back to his palace  suddenly disappearing from sight . worldhonored one  such are the freely commanded supernatural powers  wisdom  and eloquence that vimalakirti possesses  therefore i say i am not competent to visit him .  the buddha then said to good virtue  one of the wealthy men s sons   you must go visit vimalakirti and ask about his illness .  but good virtue said to the buddha   worldhonored one  i am not competent to visit him and inquire about his illness . why  because i recall once when a great bestowal gathering4 was held at my father s house  where for a period of seven days alms were given out to all the monks  brahmans and nonbuddhist believers  and to poor and humble folk  orphans  friendless persons and beggars .  at that time vimalakirti  who had joined the gathering  said to me  you are a wealthy man s sonyou should not be holding a great bestowal gathering such as this . you should hold a gathering for dharma bestowal . why hold a gathering for the bestowal of mere material goods    layman   i said  what do you mean by a gathering for dharma bestowal    he replied  a gathering for dharma bestowal is one which has no beginning and no end  in which alms are given out simultaneously to all living beings . what does this mean  it means that through bodhi one cultivates a loving mind  through saving living beings one cultivates a mind of great compassion  through adherence to the correct law one cultivates a joyful mind  and through one s grasp of wisdom one exercises an indifferent mind .  by controlling stinginess and greed one carries out the paramita of dana or almsgiving  by converting those who violate the precepts one carries out the paramita of shila or keeping of the precepts  through the doctrine of no ego one carries out the paramita of kshanti or forbearance  by dispelling attachment to the characteristics of body and mind one carries out the paramita of virya or assiduousness  through an understanding of the nature of bodhi one carries out the paramita of dhyana or meditation  and through compå™ehensive wisdom one carries out the paramita of prajna or wisdom .  by teaching and converting living beings one comes to understand emptiness  by not casting aside conditioned phenomena one comes to understand formlessness  by recognizing that living beings take on visible form one comes to understand nonaction . a brahmanical ceremony marked by sacrifices to the gods and the dispensing of charity to those pursuing the religious life and to needy persons  by guarding and upholding the correct law one acquires the power of expedient means  by rescuing living beings one acquires the four methods of winning people  by respecting and serving others one learns how to banish pride .  with regard to body  life  and wealth  one follows the doctrine that these three are indestructible  s with regard to the six objects of reverence  one follows the method of thoughtful meditation  with regard to the six types of harmonious respect one cultivates a straightforward mind . by correctly practicing the good law one achieves a pure way of life  through purity of mind  joy and delight one draws near to the worthy ones and sages  by not hating evil persons one learns to temper and discipline one s mind .  by following the rules for those who have left the household life one cultivates a deeply searching mind  by carrying out religious practices in the prescribed way one acquires much learning  by observing ways that are free from contention one creates peaceful and uncrowded surroundings  by directing one s efforts toward buddha wisdom one learns quiet meditation  by freeing living beings from their bonds one creates a setting for religious practice .  acquiring auspicious marks and purifying the buddha lands  one pursues actions that bring blessing and good fortune  understanding the minds and thoughts of all living beings and preaching the law to them in an appropriate manner  one pursues actions that bring wisdom  understanding that all phenomena are neither to be seized nor rejected  one enters the doctrinal gate of the single nature of all phenomena and pursues wise actions  cutting off all earthly desires  all blocks and hindrances  all doctrines that are not good  one pursues all manner of good works  acquiring all types of wisdom  all good doctrines  one cultivates all the methods that aid one to the buddha way.6 5 not the ordinary body but the true or eternal body  etc .  this  my good man  is what i mean by a gathering for dharma bestowal . if one is a bodhisattva and abides in such a gathering for dharma bestowal  he may be deemed a great donor of alms  and he will also be creating a field of blessings for all the world .   worldhonored one  when vimalakirti expounded the law in this fashion  two hundred of the br  ahmans gathered there all set their minds on attaining anuttarasamyaksambodhi . at that time my mind gained a purity i had never known before and i sighed with delight . bowing my head in obeisance at the feet of vimalakirti  i took off my jeweled necklace worth hundreds and thousands in gold and presented it to him  but he was unwilling to accept it .  layman   i said   i beg you by all means to accept this and to dispose of it as you wish .   vimalakirti then accepted the necklace and divided it into two parts . one part he gave to the lowliest beggars in the assembly  and one part he presented to the thus come one rarely surpassed . at that time all the members of the gathering were able to see thus come one rarely surpassed in his land called light bright  and they could also see the necklace placed on his person . then the necklace changed into a jeweled dias fitted with four pillars  richly adorned on four sides but without screens or obstructions enclosing it . 6 there are places in this troublesome passage where cause and effect seem to be in the reverse of their logical order  for example  one would expect the text to say that because one possesses a mind of great compassion  one seeks to save living beings  not that through saving living beings one acquires a mind of great compassion . but the chinese seems to be saying the latter  and translations of the tibetan version bear out this interpretation of the syntax throughout the passage . note that charles luk  apparently in an effort to avoid such difficulties  in his translation of the chinese  p. 46  arbitrarily reverses the order of cause and effect in the latter part of the passage .  vimalakirti  having worked these supernatural wonders  then spoke these words  if a donor of alms bestows gifts on the lowliest beggars with equality of mind  dispensing them with impartiality as the thus come one does in his field of blessings  if one exercises great compassion in equal measure without seeking reward or recompense  this may be called a perfectly performed dharma bestowal .   then the lowliest beggars in the city  seeing these displays of supernatural power and hearing the words of doctrine that vimalakirti had spoken  all set their minds on the attainment of anuttarasamyaksambodhi . therefore i say i am not competent to visit him and ask about his illness .  in this manner the various bodhisattvas one by one described to the buddha some past encounter with vimalakirti and praised the words he had spoken on that occasion  and all declared that they were not competent to visit him and ask about his illness . chapter 5 inquiring about the illness at that time the buddha said to manjushri   you must go visit vimalakirti and inquire about his illness .  manjushri replied to the buddha   worldhonored one  that eminent man is very difficult to confront . he is profoundly enlightened in the true nature of reality and skilled at preaching the essentials of the law . his eloquence never falters  his wisdom is free of impediments . he understands all the rules of bodhisattva conduct  and nothing in the secret storehouse of the buddhas is beyond his grasp . he has overcome the host of devils and disports himself with transcendental powers . in wisdom and expedient means he has mastered all there is to know . nevertheless  in obedience to the buddha s august command  i will go visit him and inquire about his illness .  then the bodhisattvas and major disciples in the assembly  the brahmas  indras  and four heavenly kings  all thought to themselves   now these two great men  manjushri and vimalakirti  will be talking together  and they will surely expound the wonderful law   at that time eight thousand bodhisattvas  five hundred voicehearers  and hundreds and thousands of heavenly beings all decided at once that they would like to accompany manjushri on his visit . manjushri  with this throng of bodhisattvas  major disciples  and heavenly beings reverently surrounding and accompanying him  proceeded to enter the city of vaishali . at that time the rich man vimalakirti thought to himself   now manjushri is coming with that great assembly   at once he employed his supernatural powers to empty the room  clearing it of all its contents and his attendants  leaving only a single bed on which he lay in sickness . when manjushri entered the house  he saw that the room was bare of contents  with just one bed  vimalakirti lying alone on it . vimalakirti said   welcome  manjushri  you come without the marks of coming  you see me without the marks of seeing me .  manjushri said   just so  layman . what has already come can hardly be coming . and what has already departed can hardly be departing . what do i mean  what comes has nowhere it comes from  what departs has nowhere it goes  and what is seen can not be further seen.l but let us put that aside for the moment .  layman  this illness of yourscan you endure it  is the treatment perhaps not making it worse rather than better  the worldhonored one countless times has made solicitous inquiries concerning you . layman  what is the cause of this illness  has it been with you long  and how can it be cured   vimalakirti replied   this illness of mine is born of ignorance and feelings of attachment . because all living beings are sick  therefore i am sick . if all living beings are relieved of sickness  then my sickness will be mended . why  because the bodhisattva for the sake of living beings enters the realm of birth and death  and because he is in the realm of birth and death he suffers illness . if living beings can gain release from illness  then the bodhisattva will no longer be ill.  it is like the case of a rich man who has only one child . if the child falls ill  then the father and mother too will be ill  but if the child s illness is cured  the father and mother too will be cured . the bodhisattva is like this  for he loves living beings as though they were his children . if living beings are sick  the bodhisattva will be sick  but if living beings are cured  the bodhisattva too will be cured . you ask what cause this illness arises fromthe illness of the bodhisattva arises from his great compassion .  1 vimalakirti and manjushri do a brief pas de deux on the theme of nondualism before entering on their main dialogue . manjushri said   layman  why is this room empty and without attendants   vimalakirti replied   the lands of the buddhas too are all empty   why are they empty    they are empty because of emptiness   vimalakirti replied .  and why is emptiness empty   asked manjushri .  it is empty of distinctions  therefore it is empty   was the reply .  can emptiness itself be the subject of distinctions   asked manjushri .  distinctions too are empty   was the reply .  how then is emptiness to be sought   asked manjushri .  it may be sought in the sixtytwo erroneous views of the nonbuddhists   was the reply  how are the sixtytwo views to be sought   asked manjushri .  they may be sought in the emancipation of the buddhas   was the reply .  and how is the emancipation of the buddhas to be sought   asked manjushri .  it may be sought in the minds and actions of all living beings   replied vimalakirti .  and you asked why i am without attendants . but in fact the whole host of devils and the nonbuddhist believers are all my attendants . why  because the host of devils delight in the realm of birth and death  and while the bodhisattva is in the realm of birth and death he does not scorn their company . the nonbuddhist believers delight in various views of reality  and the bodhisattva knows how to remain unmoved by such views .  manjushri said   this illness of yours  laymanwhat form does it take    my illness has no form   replied vimalakirti .  it can not be seen .  manjushri said   is this illness seated in the body or in the mind    it is not seated in the body  for it is apart from bodily form   replied vimalakirti .  and it is not seated in the mind  for the mind is a phantomlike thing .   of the four major elements  earth  water  fire  and wind  to which of these elements does this illness pertain   asked manjushri . vimalakirti replied   this illness does not pertain to the element earth  but neither is it separated from the element earth . and the same may be said of the elements water  fire  and wind . yet the illnesses of living beings arise from the four elements . and because living beings have these illnesses  therefore i too am ill.  then manjushri asked vimalakirti   how should a bodhisattva go about comforting and instructing another bodhisattva who is ill   vimalakirti replied   tell him about the impermanence of the body  but do not tell him to despise or turn away from the body . tell him about the sufferings of the body  but do not tell him to strive for nirvana . tell him that the body is without ego  but urge him to teach and guide living beings . tell him of the emptiness of the body  but do not tell him of its final extinction . tell him to repent of former offenses  but do not tell him to consign them to the past . tell him to use his own illness as a means of sympathizing with the illness of others  for he should understand their sufferings throughout the countless kalpas of their past existence  and should think how he can bring benefit to all living beings . tell him to recall the good fortune he has won through religious practice  to concentrate on a life of purity  and not to give way to gloom or worry . he should cultivate constant diligence  striving to become a king of physicians who can heal the ailments of the assembly . this is how a bodhisattva should comfort and instruct a bodhisattva who is ill so as to make him feel happy  manjushri said   layman  how should a bodhisattva who is ill go about tempering and controlling his mind   vimalakirti replied   a bodhisattva who is ill should think to himself  now these illnesses of mine all spring from the deluded thoughts  the upsidedown thinking and various earthly desires of my past existence . they have no real existence  so who is it who suffers illness  why  the four major elements come together  and therefore we apply a makeshift name  calling the thing a body . but the four major elements have no master  and the body has no  i  or ego . and these illnesses too all arise from attachment to ego . therefore i should harbor no such attachment to ego .   once one has understood the origin of illness  one may do away with the thought of an i or ego  and the thought of other living beings . to do so  one should call up the thought of phenomena  thinking to oneself  it is simply that various phenomena have come together to form this body . it has appeared simply because phenomena appeared  and it will vanish simply because phenomena vanish . and these phenomena are none of them known to one another . when they appear  they do not say   i have appeared    and when they vanish  they do not say   i have vanished    then  in order to wipe out the thought of phenomena  the ailing bodhisattva should think to himself  this thought or concept of phenomena too is a form of upsidedown thinking  and upsidedown thinking can lead to great misfortune . i must rid myself of it . but how to rid myself of it  by ridding myself of thoughts of i and mine  which means ridding myself of dualism .   what is meant by ridding oneself of dualism  it means not thinking of phenomena as internal or external  but treating all as equal . what is meant by equal  it means that i and nirvana are treated as equal . why  because i and nirvana are both empty . why are they empty  because they are mere names  hence empty neither of these two phenomena has any fixed nature or characteristics . once one has acquired this kind of equal outlook  one will be freed of all other illness and will have only the illness of emptiness  and the illness of emptiness too is empty .  this ailing bodhisattva of ours has no sensations of pain or pleasure  and yet he allows himself to feel such sensations  and while the law of the buddha is incompletely practiced he does not seek to wipe out such sensations in himself and gain entry into final enlightenment . if he feels pain in his body  he thinks of the living beings in the evil realms of existence and summons up a mind of great compassion  saying to himself  i have regulated and controlled myself  and now i must regulate and control other living beings   but he should simply rid them of their illnesses and not deprive them of anything  merely teaching and guiding them so they can cut off the source of illness .  what is meant by the source of illness  it means having troublesome entanglements . where there are troublesome entanglements  these become the source of illness . what are these troublesome entanglements tied to  they are tied to the threefold world . and how does one cut them off  by realizing that there is nothing to grasp at . if one ceases to grasp at anything  there will be no more troublesome entanglements .  what is meant by realizing there is nothing to grasp at  it means having done with dualistic views . what is meant by dualistic views  it means viewing this as internal  or viewing that as external .  have done with such views  and there will be no more grasping at things .  manjushri  this is how the ailing bodhisattva should go about regulating and controlling his mind . by doing so  he cuts off the sufferings of old age  sickness  and death . if he fails to do so  then all his religious practice and accomplishment in the past will be void of wisdom or profit . a person who has overcome a sworn enemy deserves to be called a hero . in the same way  one who has cut off both old age  sickness  and death may be called a bodhisattva .  this ailing bodhisattva should also think to himself  this illness of mine has no reality  no existence  and the illnesses of other living beings likewise have no reality and no existence when he adopts this view  if he should conceive a great compassion that is marked by affection and concern for living beings  he should at once thrust it aside . why  because the bodhisattva must rid himself of all earthly passions caused by external defilement when he summons up his great compassion . if his compassion is marked by affection and concern  then he will have feelings of weariness and revulsion toward the realm of birth and death . but if he can put aside affection and concern  he will feel no weariness and revulsion  whatever realm he happens to be born into  he will not be blinded by affection or concern .  he is not bound by the conditions of his birth  and hence he is able to preach the law for living beings and liberate them from their bonds . as the buddha has said  if one is in bonds himself  to suppose he can free others from their bonds is hardly reasonable . but if one is himself free of bonds  it is perfectly reasonable to assume he can free the bonds of others . therefore the bodhisattva must not conjure up bonds for himself .  what is meant by bonds and what is meant by liberation  to become infatuated with the taste of meditation is the bondage of the bodhisattva . to be born in this world as a form of expedient means is the liberation of the bodhisattva . wisdom without expedient means is bondage  wisdom with expedient means is liberation . expedient means without wisdom is bondage  expedient means with wisdom is liberation.2 2 in this passage  wisdom stands for the correct mental attitude of the bodhisattva in his efforts to lead others to enlightenment  and expedient means stands for the actual methods he employs . the process of liberation or enlightenment is successfully completed only when both attitude and method are correct .  what is meant by saying that wisdom without expedient means is bondage  it means that  with a mind full of affection and concern  a bodhisattva sets about to adorn the buddha lands  lead numerous living beings to them  and regulate himself with the doctrines of emptiness  formlessness  and nonaction . this is called the bondage of wisdom without expedient means .  what is meant by saying that wisdom with expedient means is liberation  it means that  with a mind free of affection and concern  a bodhisattva sets about to adorn the buddha lands  lead numerous living beings to them  and regulate himself with the doctrines of emptiness  formlessness  and nonaction  never experiencing weariness or revulsion . this is called the liberation of wisdom with expedient means .  what is meant by saying that expedient means without wisdom is bondage  it means that  while dwelling among the various earthly passions such as greed  anger  and erroneous views  a bodhisattva sets about planting many roots of virtue . this is called the bondage of expedient means without wisdom .  what is meant by saying that expedient means with wisdom is liberation  it means that  while removing himself from the various earthly passions such as greed  anger  and erroneous views  a bodhisattva sets about planting many roots of virtue  bending all his efforts in the direction of anuttarasamyaksambodhi . this is called the liberation of expedient means with wisdom .  manjushri  the ailing bodhisattva should view all phenomena in this way . and he should view the body and realize that it is marked by impermanence  suffering  emptiness  and absence of ego . this is called wisdom . but though his body may be ailing  he should constantly abide in the realm of birth and death  bringing benefit to all living beings and never giving in to weariness or revulsion . this is called expedient means .  he should further view the body and realize that the body is never rid of illness  that illness is never rid of the body  and that this body and this illness are neither prior nor posterior to one another . this is called wisdom . but though his body is ailing  the bodhisattva never seeks escape into eternal extinction . this is called expedient means .  manjushri  the ailing bodhisattva should regulate his mind by not dwelling in such regulation  but he should not dwell in nonregulation of the mind either . why  because if he dwells in nonregulation of the mind  this is the way of a stupid person . but if he dwells in regulation of the mind  this is the way of a voicehearer . therefore the bodhisattva should dwell neither in regulation nor in nonregulation of the mind . to remove himself from such dualisms is the practice of the bodhisattva .  to be in the realm of birth and death without following its tainted ways  to dwell in nirvana while not seeking eternal extinctionsuch is the practice of the bodhisattva . the practice that is neither that of common mortals nor that of worthies and sagessuch is the practice of the bodhisattva . the practice

buddha landssuch is the practice of the bodhisattva . though he attains buddhahood  turns the wheel of the law  and enters nirvana  in fact he never forsakes the bodhisattva waysuch is the practice of the bodhisattva .  when vimalakirti spoke these words  eight thousand heavenly sons in the great assembly led by manjushri all set their minds on attaining anuttarasamyaksambodhi . chapter 6 beyond comprehension at that time shariputra  observing that there were no seats in vimalakirti s room  thought to himself   all these bodhisattvas and major discipleswhere are they going to sit   the rich man vimalakirti  knowing what was in his mind  said to shariputra   did you come here for the sake of the law  or are you just looking for a place to sit    i came for the law  not for a seat   said shariputra .  ah  shariputra   said vimalaldrti   a seeker of the law does nt concern himself even about life or limb  much less about a seat  a seeker of the law seeks nothing in the way of form  perception  conception  volition  or consciousness  he seeks nothing in the way of senserealms or sensemedia  he seeks nothing in the threefold world of desire  form  and formlessness .  ah  shariputra  a seeker of the law does not seek it through attachment to the buddha  does not seek it through attachment to the law  does not seek it through attachment to the order . a seeker of the law does not seek it through recognition of suffering  does not seek it through renunciation of attachments  does not seek it through realization of how to end attachments  or through practice of the way.l why  because the law has nothing to do with idle theorizing . to declare that one must recognize suffering  renounce attachments  realize how to reach extinction  and practice the way is mere idle theorizing  not seeking the law . 1 these are the four noble truths  that existence is suffering  that suffering is caused by craving or attachment  that there is a way to end craving  that it can be done through practice of the eightfold path .  ah  shariputra  the law is called tranquil extinction .  but if one strives for birth followed by extinction  this is seeking birth and extinction  this is not seeking the law . the law is called unstained .  but if one is stained with the idea of the law or of nirvana  then one is stained with attachment  and this is not seeking the law . the law has no goal of activity  but if one actively pursues the law  one is pursuing a goal  and this is not seeking the law . the law knows no picking and choosing  but if one picks and chooses the law  this is picking and choosing  not seeking the law . the law is independent of place  but if one fixes on the idea of place  this is fixation with place  not a seeking of the law the law is called formless .  if one tries to know it through form  this is seeking form  not seeking the law .  the law is not something that can be resided in . if one tries to reside in it  this is trying to reside in the law  not seeking the law . the law is not something that can be seen  heard  perceived  or understood . if one tries to see  hear  perceive  and understand it  this is trying to see  hear  perceive  and understand the law  not seeking the law . the law is called unconditioned .  if one tries to approach it through the conditioned  this is seeking the conditioned  not seeking the law  therefore  shariputra  if one would be a seeker of the law  one must not seek it in anything at all .  when vimalakirti spoke these words  five hundred heavenly sons gained the purity of the dharma eye in their perception of phenomena . at that time the rich man vimalakirti said to manjushri   you have visited countless thousands  ten thousands  billions of asamkhyas of countries . what buddha lands have the finest and most beautiful lion seats  those endowed with the best quajities   manjushri replied   layman  to the east  beyond countries numerous as the sands of thirtysix ganges  lies a world called sumeru shape . its buddha is named sumeru lamp king  and he is there now this buddha s body is eightyfour thousand yojanas in height and the lion seat  he sits on  is eightyfour thousand yojanas high and adorned in the finest fashion .  the rich man vimalakirti then exercised his transcendental powers and at once that buddha dispatched thirtytwo thousand lion seats  tall  broad  adorned  and pure  and had them brought into vimalakirti s room  where the bodhisattvas  major disciples  indras  brahmas  four heavenly kings and the others saw something they had never seen before . for the room was broad and spacious enough to hold all these thirtytwo thousand lion seats without the slightest crowding or hindrance . the city of vaishali and jambudvipa and the other of the four continents too seemed in no way cramped or inconvenienced  but all appeared just as usual . at that time vimalakirti said to manjushri   sit down in one of the lion seats  the bodhisattvas and other distinguished persons should also sit down  but when they do so they should assume bodies suitabje to the size of the seat .  the bodhisattvas who had acquired transcendental powers thereupon immediately transformed their shapes  making themselves fortytwo yojanas tall  and sat down in the lion seats . but among the bodhisattvas who had newly embarked on their course or the major disciples  there were none who could climb up into the seats . at that time vimalakirti said to shariputra   sit down in a lion seat   but shariputra said   layman  these seats are too tall and widewe ca nt climb up in them   vimalakirti said   ah  shariputra  if you will make obeisance to the thus come one sumeru lamp king  then you will be able to take a seat .  the bodhisattvas who had newly embarked on their course and the major disciples accordingly made obeisance to the thus come one sumeru lamp king  and after that they were able to seat themselves in the lion seats . shariputra said   layman  i have never seen such a thing  a little room like this and still it can hold seats as tall and broad as these  and the city of vaishali is in no way crowded or obstructed  nor are any of the towns or villages of jambudvipa or of the other of the four continents cramped or inconvenienced  or the palaces of the heavenly beings  dragon kings and spirits i  vimalakirti said   ah  shariputra  the buddhas and bodhisattvas have an emancipation that is called beyond comprehension . when a bodhisattva dwells in this emancipation  he can take something as tall and broad as mount sumeru and put it inside a mustard seed without enlarging one or shrinking the other  and mount sumeru  king of mountains  will still have its original shape . moreover  the four heavenly kings and the gods of the trayastrimsha heaven  who live on mount sumeru  will not even know or realize where they have gone to . only those destined for enlightenment will be able to see that sumeru has been put inside a mustard seed . this is called dwelling in the doctrine of the emancipation beyond comprehension .  or again  this bodhisattva can take the waters of the four great oceans and pour them into the opening that holds a single hair  without the fish  turtles  sea turtles  lizards  or other sea creatures being in any way troubled  and those great seas will still have their original form . and the dragons  spirits  asuras  and others  who live in the sea  will not know or realize where they have gone to  and these beings will not be at all troubled .  or again  shariputra  this bodhisattva who dwells in the emancipation beyond comprehension can slice off the thousandmillionfold world  grasp it in the palm of his right hand like a potter s wheel  and toss it beyond lands numerous as the sands of the ganges  and the beings in that world will not know or realize where they have gotten to . the bodhisattva can then bring it back and put it in its original place  and none of the people will have any idea they have gone somewhere and come back  and the world will have the same shape as before .  again  shariputra  suppose there are beings who want to live in this world for a long time but are qualified to enter enlightenment . this bodhisattva can stretch seven days into a kalpa  so that to those beings they really seem like a whole kalpa . or if there are beings who do not want to live in this world for long and they are qualified to enter enlightenment  this bodhisattva can squeeze a kalpa into seven days  so that to those beings it seems like only seven days .  again  shariputra  the bodhisattva who dwells in the emancipation beyond comprehension can take the magnificent adornments from all the buddha lands  gather them together  and show them to the beings living in a single country or this bodhisattva can place all the beings of a single buddha land in the palm of his right hand and fly with them all around the ten directions  showing them everything  and yet never move from his original spot .  or  shariputra  this bodhisattva can take all the objects offered to the buddhas by the beings in the worlds in the ten directions and make them all visible within a pore that holds a single hair  or take all the suns  moon  stars  and constellations that belong to the worlds in the ten directions and make them visible within the pore of a single hair or  shariputra  he can suck into his mouth all the winds from the worlds in the ten directions without doing any harm to himself or breaking down the trees that grow there . or  when the worlds in the ten directions come to the end of the kalpa and everything is destroyed by fire  he can take all those fires and hold them in his belly  and though the fires go on burning as before  the bodhisattva suffers no harm . or he can go down into the lower region  past buddha lands numerous as the sands of the ganges  pick up one buddha land  and lift it to the upper region  above buddha lands numerous as the sands of the ganges  as one would lift the leaf of a jujube tree on the point of a needle  and that land will be in no way troubled .  or  shariputra  the bodhisattva who dwells in the emancipation beyond comprehension can use his transcendental powers to make himself appear in the body of a buddha  or the body of a pratyekabuddha  or that of a voicehearer  an indra  a brahma king  one of the four heavenly kings  or a wheelturning king . or again he can take all the voices uttered by the beings in the worlds of the ten directions  high  middle  and lowgrade sounds  and transform them all into the voice of the buddha . he can make these voices discourse with the sounds of impermanence   suffering   emptiness   or nonego   or expound all the various other doctrines preached by the buddhas of the ten directions  and cause those doctrines to be heard everywhere .  shariputra  i have just now briefly described the powers possessed by this bodhisattva of the emancipation beyond comprehension . if i were to describe them in full  i could go on for a whole kalpa and never have done .  at that time mahakashyapa  hearing this discourse on the doctrine of the emancipation beyond comprehension  sighed at encountering what he had never heard before  and said to shariputra   it is like someone displaying various painted images before a blind man when he can not see them . in the same way  when we voicehearers hear this doctrine of the emancipation beyond comprehension  we are all incapable of understanding it . if wise persons hear it  there will be none who do not set their minds on attaining anuttarasamyaksambodhi . but what of us  who are forever cut off at the root  who with regard to these great vehicle teachings have already become like rotten seed  2 2 the voicehearers  who represent hinayana buddhism  because they have taken as their goal the attainment of the state of arhat  have in effect cut themselves off at the root from the search for the higher goal of buddhahood  the goal of great uehicle or mahayana buddhist doctrine and practice . in mahayana terms  the potential for buddhahood inherent in the voicehearers has become like rotten seed that will never sprout . when voicehearers hear this doctrine of the emancipation beyond comprehension  they will surely all cry out in anguish in voices loud enough to shake the whole thousandmillionfold world . but bodhisattvas should all accept this teaching with great joy and thanksgiving . for if there are bodhisattvas who put faith in this doctrine of the emancipation beyond comprehension  then none of the host of devils can do anything to them   when mahakashyapa spoke these words  thirtytwo thousand offspring of the gods set their minds on the attainment of anuttarasamyaksambodhi . at that time vimalakirti said to mahakashyapa   sir  among those who play the part of devil kings in the immeasurable asamkhyas of worlds in the ten directions  there are many who in fact are bodhisattvas dwelling in the emancipation beyond comprehension . they employ their skill in expedient means to teach and convert living beings by appearing in the guise of devil kings .  or again  kashyapa  with regard to the immeasurable numbers of bodhisattvas in the ten directions  sometimes people come to them begging for a hand or a foot  an ear  a nose  a head  an eye  marrow or brains  blood  flesh  skin  bones  or for their villages  towns  wives and children  men and women servants  elephants  horses  carriages  or for gold  lapis lazuli  seashell  agate  coral  amber  pearls  agate shell  clothing  food or drink . many of those who beg in this fashion are bodhisattvas who dwell in the emancipation beyond comprehension . they employ their skill in expedient means and go to the other bodhisattvas to test them and make sure they are firm in their resolve  to give alms  . how can they do this  because the bodhisattvas who dwell in the emancipation beyond comprehension possess powers of authority and virtue that enable them to importune others and make them perform difficult feats in this manner.3 ordinary persons of inferior type have no such powers and hence can not importune others as these bodhisattvas do . they are like donkeys who can not stand up before the kicking and trampling of dragons or elephants .  this is what is called the wisdom and expedient means possessed by the bodhisattvas who dwell in the emancipation beyond comprehension .  3 in speaking of people being importuned for an eye or some other part of the body  vimalakirti probably has in mind the various tales in buddhist lore of deities who take on devilish form and beg practitioners of the way for a piece of their body as a means of testing their dedication to the paramita of almsgiving . vimalakirti is thus suggesting that the difficulties that mahakashyapa and the other voicehearers face may in fact just be a means of testing their resolve . chapter 7 regarding living beings at that time manjushri asked vimalakirti   how does the bodhisattva regard living beings   vimalakirti replied   as a conjurer looks on the beings he conjures upthus does the bodhisattva regard living beings . as the wise view the moon in the water  or a face or form seen in a mirror  as shimmers of heat in a torrid season  as the echo that follows a cry  as clouds in the sky  as foam on the water  bubbles on the water  as a thing no firmer that the trunk of the plantain  no longer lasting than a flash of lightning  as a fifth great element  a sixth component  a seventh sensemedia  a thirteenth sensemedia  a nineteenth senserealmlthus does the bodhisattva regard living beings .  as forms in the world of formlessness  as sprouts from charred grain  as mistaken views of the body in one who has entered the stream that leads to the state of arhat  as a reentering of the womb by one no longer subject to rebirth  as the three poisons of greed  anger  and ignorance in ari arhat  as greed  anger  or violation of the precepts on the part of a bodhisattva who has accepted the birthless nature of all existence  as vestiges of earthly desire in a buddha  as forms seen by a blind person  as the breathing in and out of one immersed in the samadhi of utter tranquility  as the tracks of a bird in the sky  as a child born to a barren woman  as  earthly desires in a phantom being  as sights in a dream after one has wakened  as the taking on of bodily form by one who has entered extinction  as fire that has no smokethus does the bodhisattva regard living beings .  1 that is  as one more of each category than actually exists . manjushri said   if the bodhisattva looks on beings in this way  how can he treat them with compassion   vimalakirti replied   when the bodhisattva has finished regarding them in this way  he thinks to himself . for the sake of living beings i must preach this law to them   this is true compassion .  he treats them with a compassion of tranquil extinction  for it results in no birth  treats them with a compassion unburning  for it is void of earthly desires  treats them with a compassion that is impartial  as the three existences of past  present  and future are impartial  treats them with a compassion free of contention  for nothing arises to oppose it  treats them with a compassion undualistic  for internal and external have no place in it  treats them with a compassion unfaltering  for it carries through to the end  treats them with a compassion firm and durable  for the mind of the bodhisattva never flags  treats them with a compassion clean and pure  as the nature of all phenomena is pure  treats them with a compassion boundless  boundless as the empty sky .  he treats them with the compassion of the arhat  who has conquered the thieves of desire  treats them with the compassion of the bodhisattva  who brings contentment to all beings  treats them with the compassion of the thus come one  who has grasped the marks of suchness  treats them with the compassion of the buddha  who awakens living beings  treats them with a compassion wholly natural  understanding that it is causeless  treats them with a compassion of bodhi  which is of one flavor only  treats them with a compassion that has no gradation  for it cuts off all favoritism  treats them with great pity and compassion  guiding them with the great vehicle .  he treats them with a compassion that never despairs  seeing that all is empty and without ego  treats them with the compassion of bestowal of the law  never stinting in its gifts  treats them with the compassion of observance of the precepts  training those who break them to do better  treats them with the compassion of forbearance  guarding both others and self  treats them with the compassion of assiduousness  shouldering all beings as its burden  treats them with the compassion of meditation  unaffected by taste  treats them with the compassion of wisdom  which always knows the right time  treats them with the compassion of expedient means  with manifestations suited to every occasion .  he treats them with a compassion that hides nothing  proceeding with the purity of an upright mind  treats them with the compassion of a deeply searching mind  one free of irrelevant motion  treats them with a compassion that is unerring  innocent of falsity and sham  treats them with a compassion full of peace and delight  for through it they gain the delight of the buddha . such is the compassion of the bodhisattva .  continuing his questioning  manjushri asked   what do you mean when you speak of pity    i mean that whatever benefits the bodhisattva gains  he shares them all with all other living beings   replied vimalakirti . manjushri   what do you mean by joy   vimalakirti   any way the bodhisattva can aid or enrich others he views as an occasion for joy and never for regret .  manjushri   what do you mean by indifference   vimalakirti   whatever blessings or good fortune the bodhisattva bestows  he expects nothing in return .  2 manjushri then asked   if the bodhisattva fears the cycle of birth and death  what should he rely on   vimalakirti replied   the bodhisattva  fearing the cycle of birth and death  should rely on the power of the tathagata s blessings .  manjushri   if he hopes to rely on the power of the tathagata s blessings  what course should he pursue   2 compassion  pity  joy  and indif ference constitute the four immeasurable qualities . see glossary . vimalakirti   if he hopes to rely on the power of the tathagata s blessings  he should devote himself to saving and liberating all living beings .  manjushri   if he hopes to save living beings  what must he free them from   vimalakirti   if he hopes to save living beings  he must free them from earthly desires .  manjushri   if he hopes to free them from earthly desires  how should he proceed   vimalakirti   he should proceed by the method of correct mindfulness .  manjushri   how does one proceed by the method of correct mindfulness   vimalakirti   one proceeds on the premise of no birth and no extinction .  manjushri   what has no birth  and what has no extinction   vimalakirti   the not good has no birth  the good has no extinction .  manjushri   what is the root of good and not good   vimalakirti   the body is the root .  manjushri   what is the root of the body   vimalakirti   desire and greed are the root .  manjushri   what is the root of desire and greed   vimalakirti   false and empty distinctions are the root .  manjushri   what is the root of false and empty distinctions   vimalakirti   topsyturvy thinking is the root .  manjushri   what is the root of topsyturvy thinking   vimalakirti   groundless assumptions are the root of topsyturvy thinking .  manjushri   what is the root of groundless assumptions   vimalakirti   what is groundless can have no root . manjushri  it is on the root of this groundlessness that all the other concepts are built up .  at that time there was a heavenly being  a goddess  in vimalakirti s room who  seeing these great men and hearing them expound the law  proceeded to make herself visible and  taking heavenly flowers  scattered them over the bodhisattvas and major disciples . when the flowers touched the bodhisattvas  they all fell to the floor at once  but when they touched the major disciples  they stuck to them and did not fall off . the disciples all tried to shake off the flowers through their supernatural powers  but they could not do so . at that time the goddess said to shariputra   why try to brush off the flowers    such flowers are not in accordance with the law   he replied .  that s why i try to brush them off .  3 the goddess said   do nt say these flowers are not in accordance with the law . why  because the flowers make no such distinctions . you in your thinking have made up these distinctions  that s all . if one who has left the household life to follow the buddha s law makes such distinctions  that is not in accordance with the law . one must be without distinctions to be in accordance with the law look at the bodhisattvasthe flowers do not stick to them because they have already cut off all thought of distinctions . just as evil spirits are able to take advantage of a person who is beset by fear  so because you disciples are fearful of the cycle of birth and death  the senses of form  sound  smell  taste  and touch are able to take advantage of you . but once a person has done away with fear  then the five desires that arise from these senses will not be able to get at him . so long as one has not done away with all such entanglements  the flowers will stick to him . but they will not stick to someone who has eliminated them all .  shariputra said   goddess  have you been staying in this room long   she replied   venerable sir  my stay in this room is about as long as your attainment of emancipation .  3 the wearing of flowers or other personal ornaments was forbidden to members of the buddhist order . shariputra said   so you ve been here a long time    venerable sir   said the goddess   how long has your attainment of emancipation been   shariputra was silent and did not answer . the goddess said   with your great wisdom  venerable sir  why do you remain silent   shariputra replied   emancipation can not be spoken of in words . therefore i do not know what i can say to you .  the goddess said   words  writing  all are marks of emancipation . why  because emancipation is not internal  not external  and not in between . and words likewise are not internal  not external  and not in between . therefore  shariputra  you can speak of emancipation without putting words aside . why  because all things that exist are marks of emancipation .  shariputra said   does nt emancipation mean putting aside lewdness  anger  and stupidity   the goddess said   the buddha  addressing persons of overbearing arrogance  asserted that one must put aside lewdness  anger  and stupidity in order to gain emancipation  that is all . if he was addressing those who were free of overbearing arrogance  the buddha asserted that the nature of lewdness  anger  and stupidity is emancipation itself .  shariputra said   excellent  excellent  goddess  what have you seized on  what have you seen into  that you speak with such eloquence   the goddess replied   i have seized on nothing  seen into nothing  and hence speak with eloquence . why  if one claims to have seized on something or seen into something  then in the light of the buddha s law one is being overbearingly arrogant .  shariputra asked the goddess   of the three vehicles  which do you pursue   the goddess replied   i use the law of the voicehearer to convert living beings  and therefore i practice the way of the voicehearer . i use the law of causes and conditions to convert living beings  and therefore i practice the way of the pratyekabuddha . i use the law of great pity to convert living beings  and therefore i practice the great vehicle .  shariputra  when one enters a grove of champak trees  one smells only the odor of the champak and does not smell any other odor . and in the same way  when one enters this room  one smells only the fragrance of the buddha blessings but takes no delight in smelling the fragrance of the voicehearer s or the pratyekabuddha s blessings  shariputra  these brahmas  indras  four heavenly kings  heavenly beings  dragons  spirits  and others who have entered this room and listen to this great man expound the correct law all delight in the fragrance of the buddha blessings and leave with their minds set on attaining them .  shariputra  i have been staying in this room for twelve years and never from the first have i heard any expounding of the law of the voicehearer or the pratyekabuddha . i have heard only of the great compassion and great pity of the bodhisattva  the law of the buddha that is beyond comprehension .  shariputra  this room constantly manifests eight rare and unprecedented phenomena . what are these eight  this room is constantly flooded with rays of golden light that never change  day or night . it is not lit by the shining of the sun or moon . this is the first rare and unprecedented phenomenon .  those who enter this room are never troubled by defilements . this is the second rare and unprecedented phenomenon .  in this room brahmas  indras  four heavenly kings  and bodhisattvas from other regions constantly come together in a gathering that never ends . this is the third rare and unprecedented phenomenon .  in this room there is constant exposition of the six paramitas and the unregressing wheel of the law . this is the fourth rare and unprecedented phenomenon .  in this room heavenly beings constantly make superlative music  and from their strings come forth the sounds of immeasurable dharma persuasions . this is the fifth rare and unprecedented phenomenon .  in this room are four great storehouses stacked high with varied treasures to relieve the destitute and rescue those in want  a supply to be drawn on yet never exhausted . this is the sixth rare and unprecedented phenomenon .  when this great man turns his thoughts to them  shakyamuni buddha  amita buddha  akshobhya buddha  jeweled virtue  jeweled flame  jeweled moon  jeweled majesty  hard to surpass  lion echo  profiting all  and countless other such buddhas from the ten directions come at once to this room and broadly expound the secret and essential teachings  the storehouse of the dharma . and when they have finished expounding  they return to where they came from . this is the seventh rare and unprecedented phenomenon .  within this room the magnificently adorned palaces of all the heavenly beings and the pure lands of the various buddhas are all to be seen . this is the eighth rare and unprecedented phenomenon .  these are the eight rare and unprecedented phenomena . shariputra  who  seeing these sights beyond belief  would still delight in the law of the voicehearer   shariputra said   why do nt you change out of this female body   4 the goddess replied   for the past twelve years i have been trying to take on female form  but in the end with no success . what is there to change  if a sorcerer were to conjure up a phantom woman and then someone asked her why she did nt change out of her female body  would that be any kind of reasonable question    no   said shariputra .  phantoms have no fixed form  so what would there be to change   4 shariputra assumes that any woman would naturally want to change into a man if she had the power to do so . the goddess said   all things are just the samethey have no fixed form . so why ask why i do nt change out of my female form   at that time the goddess employed her supernatural powers to change shariputra into a goddess like herself  while she took on shariputra s form . then she asked   why do nt you change out of this female body   shariputra  now in the form of a goddess  replied   i do nt know why i have suddenly changed and taken on a female body   the goddess said   shariputra  if you can change out of this female body  then all women can change likewise . shariputra  who is not a woman  appears in a woman s body . and the same is true of all womenthough they appear in women s bodies  they are not women . therefore the buddha teaches that all phenomena are neither male nor female .  then the goddess withdrew her supernatural powers  and shariputra returned to his original form . the goddess said to shariputra   where now is the form and shape of your female body   shariputra said   the form and shape of my female body does not exist  yet does not not exist .  the goddess said   all things are just like thatthey do not exist  yet do not not exist . and that they do not exist  yet do not not exist  is exactly what the buddha teaches .  shariputra said to the goddess   when your present existence comes to an end  where will you be reborn   the goddess replied   the way the buddha is born in his transformation bodythat s how i ll be born .  5 shariputra said   when the buddha is born in his transformation body  it is not a matter of birth or death . 5 the buddha takes on a  transformation body  when he appears in one of the lower realms of existence in order to guide and instruct the beings there . see glossary  under  three bodies .  the goddess said   it s that way with living beings toothey are without birth or death .  shariputra said to the goddess   how long will it be before you attain anuttarasamyaksambodhi   the goddess replied   shariputra  when you revert to the state of a common unenlightened mortal  then i will succeed in gaining anuttarasamyaksambodhi .  shariputra said   it is unthinkable that i should become a common mortal again   the goddess said   it is likewise unthinkable that i should attain anuttarasamyaksambodhi . why  because bodhi is nothing to be thought about  hence nothing to be attained .  shariputra said   the buddhas who are now attaining anuttarasamyaksambodhi  and those who have attained it in the past and will attain it in the future  numerous as the sands of the gangeswhat would you say of all those   the goddess said   we use the numbers of everyday language  and so we speak of all those as belonging to the three existences of past  present  and future . but this is not to say that bodhi knows anything of past  present  and future .  . then the goddess said   shariputra  have you attained the way of the arhat   shariputra said   i ve realized there is nothing to be attained  so i ve attained it .  the goddess said   the buddhas and bodhisattvas are that waã½ too . they ve realized there is nothing to attain  and so they ve attained it .  at this time vimalakirti said to shariputra   this goddess has in the past made offerings to ninetytwo million buddhas and can disport herself with the supernatural powers of a bodhisattva . she has fulfilled all that she vowed  has accepted the truth of birthlessness  and dwells in a state from which she will never regress . because of her original vow  she can show herself anytime she  vishes and teach and convert living beings .  chapter 8 the buddha way at that time manjushri asked vimalakirti   how does the bodhisattva go about mastering the buddha way   vimalakirti said   the bodhisattva should follow a path that is not the waythen he can master the buddha way .  manjushri asked   how does the bodhisattva follow a path that is not the way   vimalakirti replied   if the bodhisattva goes to the region of the five sins that lead to the hell of incessant suffering  he shows no anguish or anger . he arrives in hell  but is free of offense or defilement . he arrives in the realm of beasts  but without the faults of stupidity or arrogance . he arrives in the realm of the hungry spirits  yet is fully endowed with merits . he goes to the world of form and the world of formlessness  but makes no boast of this .  he shows greed and desire in his actions  yet is removed from the stains of attachment . he shows anger in his actions  yet has no anger or aversion toward living beings . he appears to be stupid  but utilizes wisdom to regulate his mind . he appears stingy and grasping  yet relinquishes both inner and outer possessions  begrudging neither body nor life . he appears to break the commandments  but in fact resides secure in the pure precepts  and even then remains fearful of committing the smallest fault .  he seems angry and irascible  yet is at all times compassionate and forbearinga he seems indolent and lazy  yet works diligently to acquire merit . he seems disordered in thought  yet constantly practices meditation . he seems stupid  yet has mastered both worldly and otherworldly wisdom .  he appears fawning and deceitful  but is skilled in expedient means and faithful to the sutra doctrines . he appears haughty and arrogant  yet serves as a bridge and a crossing for living beings . he appears to be immersed in earthly desires  but his mind is at all times clear and pure .  we see him going among devils  yet he abides by the buddha wisdom and heeds no other teachings . we see him going among voicehearers  but to living beings he preaches a law never heard before . we see him going among pratyekabuddhas  but he manifests great pity in teaching and converting living beings .  he seems to be among the poor and destitute  yet he has jeweled hands capable of bestowing inexhaustible benefits . he seems to be crippled and deformed  yet possesses auspicious features  adorning himself wonderfully with them . he seems to be humble and lowly  yet is born into the seed and lineage of the buddha  fully endowed with blessings . he seems to be among the puny and emaciated  the ugly and vile  yet acquires the body of a narayana  a delight for all beings to see.l he seems to be old and ailing  yet has forever cut off the roots of illness and transcended the fear of death .  he appears to possess wealth  but habitually regards it as transient and in fact covets none of it . he seems to have wives  concubines  and waiting women  yet never sullies himself in the bog of the five desires . he seems thicktongued and clumsy in speech  yet commands great eloquence and retains all he has learned  forgetting nothing . though appearing to employ unorthodox methods of salvation  he follows the correct teaching in saving living beings . he appears to enter all the different paths of existence  yet cuts himself off from their influence . he appears to have entered nirvana  yet never cuts himself off from the realm of birth and death . 1 narayana  an incarnation of vishnu  ã­s incorporated into buddhism as a guardian deity noted for his heroic strength and stature .  manjushri  by going to places that are the opposite of the way in this fashion  the bodhisattva is able to master the buddha way .  vimalakirti than asked manjushri   what may act as the seeds of the thus come one   2 2 that is  the seeds leading to enlightenment or buddhahood . manjushri said   the body is the seed  ignorance and partiality are the seeds  greed  anger  and stupidity are the seeds . the four topsyturvy views are the seeds  the five obscurations are the seeds  the six sensemedia are the seeds  the seven abodes of consciousness are the seeds  the eight errors are the seeds  the nine sources of anxiety are the seeds  the ten evil actions are the seeds . to sum it up  the sixtytwo erroneous views and all the different kinds of earthly desires are all the seeds of the buddha .   what do you mean by that   manjushri replied   a person who has perceived the uncreated nature of reality and entered into correct understanding can not again set his mind on attaining anuttarasamyaksambodhi . the lotus does not grow on the upland plain  the lotus grows in the mud and mire of a damp lowlying place . in the same way  the buddha law can never grow in a person who has perceived the uncreated nature of reality and entered into correct understanding . it is only when living beings are in the midst of the mire of earthly desires that they turn to the buddha law .  if you plant seeds in the sky  they will never grow . only when you plant them in wellmanured soil can they sprout and flourish . in the same way  the buddha law will never grow in a person who has perceived the uncreated nature of reality and entered into correct understanding . but one who entertains egoistic views as huge as mount sumeru can still set his mind on the attainment of anuttarasamyaksambodhi . from this you should understand thataall the various earthly desires are the seeds of the thus come one . if you do not descend into the vast ocean  you can never acquire a priceless pearl in the same way  if you do not enter the great sea of earthly desires  you can never acquire the treasure of comprehensive wisdom .  y  .  at that time mahakashyapa sighed and said   excellent  excellent  manjushri  these words are aptly spoken . it is indeed just as you say . those who are troubled by the passions are the seeds of the thus come one . but persons such as us   the voice hearers   are now no longer capable of setting our minds on the attainment of anuttarasamyaksambodhi . even those who have committed the five sins that lead to the hell of incessant suffering can still rouse aspirations that will afford growth to the buddha law . but now we can never rouse such aspirations . we are like persons whose faculties are impaired and can no longer satisfy the five desires . the voicehearers  who have cut off all entanglements  are like this  for they can no longer bene fit from the buddha law  nor will they ever have the desire to .  in this sense  manjushri  the common mortal responds with gratitude to the buddha law but the voicehearer does not . why do i say this  because when the common mortal hears the buddha law  he can set his mind on attaining the unsurpassed way  determined that the three treasures shall never perish . but the voicehearer may hear of the buddha s law and powers and fearlessness to the end of his life and yet never be capable of rousing in himself an aspiration for the unsurpassed way .  at that time there was in the assembly a bodhisattva named universally manifested physical body who asked vimalakirti   layman  your father and mother  wife and children  relatives  retainers  clerks  people  and friendswho are they  your maids and men servants  your elephants  horses  and carriageswhere are they   vimalakirti replied with the following verses  wisdom is the bodhisattva s mother  expedient means his father  of those who guide and teach all beings  there are none not born of these . dharma joy is his wife  pity and compassion of mind are his daughters  the good mind and sincerity his sons  final emptiness and tranquility his dwelling . for disciples he has the many dusts and passions  they follow the dictates of his will . the thirtyseven elements of the way are his good friends  through them he gains correct enlightenment . the paramitas are his dharma companions  the four methods of winning others  his singing girls . for songs they carol the words of the dharma  such is the music made for him . in the garden of full retention of the teachings grow the trees of the law free of outflows . their wonderful blossoms are the seven factors of enlightenment  their fruit  emancipation and wisdom . on the bathingpool of the eight emancipations  brimming with clear waters of meditation  spread the lotuses of the seven purities  those who bathe there are spotless . his elephants and horses race the five roads of transcendental power  for chariot he has the great vehicle . controlling  directing with the single mind  he travels the eightfold path . his form displays all the auspicious marks  every good feature adorns him . he is clothed in the garments of shame and remorse  a deeply searching mind his garland . for wealth he has the treasure of the seven assets which he teaches to others  enriching them . he practices as the teachings direct  his great profits he shares with others . his couch is the four meditations  where the pure way of life is born . he hears much  augmenting his wisdom  sounding the call of selfawakening . the sweet dew of the law is his food  sauced with the flavor of emancipation . he bathes in purification of the mind  anointing himself with the perfume of the precepts . he wipes out the thieves of earthly desire  his valor can not be outshone . he conquers and subdues the four kinds of devils  his victory banners fly over the place of practice . though he knows there is no arising or extinction  he undergoes birth so he may instruct others . in every land he manifests himself  like the sun  nowhere is he not seen . to the countless millions of thus come ones of the ten directions he gives alms  yet he never thinks of these buddhas as in any way separate from himself . though he knows that the buddha lands  along with living beings  are empty  yet constantly he works to purify the lands  teaching and converting the many beings . the form and voice and behavior of every manner of living being  the bodhisattva with his fearless powers can take on any of these in an instant . he understands all devilish affairs and can imitate the actions of devils . wise in the skillful use of expedient means  he can manifest all such forms at will . at times he shows himself old  sick  dying  in order to wake living beings  so they will realize they are like conjured phantoms and gain understanding free of all obstacles . sometimes he shows the kalpa ending in flames  heaven and earth consumed with all else  so that people who think of things as permanent will clearly perceive their impermanence . countless billions of living beings come in company to visit the bodhisattva  all arriving at his house at the same moment  he converts them  directs them to the buddha way . secular writings  secret spells and incantations  crafts  skills  the many arts  all these he shows himself adept in  so he may aid and benefit living beings . he becomes a monk in all the different creeds of the world so that thereby he may free others from delusion and save them from falling into erroneous beliefs . at times he becomes the sun  the moon  a heavenly being  an indra  a brahma  lord of the world  at others he may become earth or water  or again become wind or fire . if during the kalpa there is pestilence  he manifests himself as medicinal herbs  those who drink potions made from them will be healed of sickness  cleansed of all poison . if during the kalpa there is famine  he manifests his body as food and drink  first relieving hunger and thirst  then telling people of the law . if during the kalpa there is a clash of arms  he accordingly rouses a mind of compassion  converting those living beings  causing them to dwell in a land without contention . when great armies confront each other in the field  he causes them to be of equal might  manifesting his bodhisattva power and authority  subduing them and restoring peace . in whatever country hells exist  at once he sets out  journeys there  striving to relieve their sufferings . in whatever country beasts are devouring one another  in all his births he manifests himself there so he can bring aid to those lands . he shows himself subject to the five desires yet is also seen to practice meditation  causing the devils  minds to be dazed and confounded so they can not take advantage of others . to live as a lotus among flamesthis may be deemed a rare thing . to exist amid desire yet practice meditationthis too is rare  sometimes he shows himself as a woman of pleasure  enticing those prone to lechery . first he catches them with the hook of desire  then leads them into the buddha way sometimes he appears as a village headman  other times as leader of the merchants  as a teacher of the nation  a highplaced official  abetting and profiting all beings . where there are those in poverty and want he shows himself with limitless stores  using them to encourage and lead others  causing them to set their minds on attaining bodhi . among those arrogant and full of ego he becomes a man of great strength  overpowering and curbing their haughtiness  causing them to dwell in the unsurpassed way . where there are those timid and quailing he stands at their head to lend assurance . first he fills them with fearlessness  then causes them to set their minds on the way . sometimes he is seen renouncing lust and desire to become a holy man of the five transcendental powers  opening the way  guiding living beings  causing them to dwell in the precepts  forbearance and compassion . if there are those looking for servants  he shows himself as a groom or menial  and after delighting his employers  he rouses in them a mind for the way . whatever others are looking for  he supplies it to win them to the buddha way with his skill in the power of expedient means he can satisfy all their waits . thus his ways are beyond measure  his practices know no bounds  infinite in wisdom  he saves and emancipates countless beings . though all the buddhas for numberless billions of kalpas should praise the merits he achieves  they could never finish doing so . who can hear of this law and not set his mind on the attainment of bodhi  who but the utterly worthless  the blindly ignorant  the witless  chapter 9 entering tiie gate of nondualism at that time vimalakirti said to the various bodhisattvas   sirs  how does the bodhisattva go about entering the gate of nondualism  let each one explain as he understands it .  one of the bodhisattvas in the assembly  whose name was dharma freedom  spoke these words   sirs  birth and extinction form a dualism . but since all dharmas are not born to begin with  they must now be without extinction . by grasping and learning to accept this truth of birthlessness  one may enter the gate of nondualism .  the bodhisattva virtue guardian said   i  and mine  form a dualism . because there is an i   there is also a mine .  but if there is no i   there will be no mine .  in this way one enters the gate of nondualism .  the bodhisattva unblinking said   perception and nonperception form a dualism . but if dharmas are not perceived  then there is nothing to take hold of . and because there is nothing to take hold of  there will be no grasping  no rejecting  no action  no volition . in this way one enters the gate of nondualism .  the bodhisattva virtue peak said   defilement and purity form a dualism . but if one sees into the true nature of defilement  it is without the marks of purity but leads into the extinction of all marks . in this way one enters the gate of nondualism .  the bodhisattva good constellation said   the stirring of the mind and thoughtthese two form a dualism . but if the mind is not stirred  then there will be . no thought . and if there is no thought  there will be no discrimination . the one who has thoroughly mastered this may in this way enter the gate of nondualism .  the bodhisattva good eye said   the unique in form and the formless constitute a dualism . but if one understands that the unique in form is in fact the formless  and then does not seize on the formless but sees all as equal  one may in this way enter the gate of nondualism .  the bodhisattva wonderful arm said   the bodhisattva mind and the voicehearer mind constitute a dualism . but if one regards the mind as empty in form  like a conjured phantom  then there is no bodhisattva mind and no voicehearer mind . in this way one may enter the gate of nondualism .  the bodhisattva pushyal said   good and not good form a dualism . but if one does not call up either good or not good but enters into the realm of the formless and truly masters it  in this way one may enter the gate of nondualism .  the bodhisattva lion said   blame and blessing form a dualism . but if one penetrates the true nature of blame  it is no different from blessing . when one can dispose of forms with this diamondlike wisdom  neither bound nor liberated  one may in this way enter the gate of nondualism .  the bodhisattva lion will said   presence of outflows of passion and absence of such outflows constitute a dualism . but if one can grasp the fact that all dharmas are equal  then one will not give rise to the concept of outflows or no outflows . one will not be attached to form nor dwell in formlessness either . in this way one may enter the gate of nondualism .  the bodhisattva pure understanding said   the created and the uncreated form a dualism . but if one does away with all enumerations  then the mind is like empty sky  freed of all obstacles through pure clean wisdom . in this way one enters the gate of nondualism .  1 pushya  pusya  is the twentythird of the twentyeight constellations or stellar mansions of indian astrology  the constellation under whose influence this bodhisattva was born . the bodhisattva narayana said   the worldly and the unworldly form a dualism . but since the nature of the worldly is empty  the worldly is in fact the unworldly neither entering into it nor going out of it  neither exceeding nor falling shortin this way one enters the gate of nondualism .  the bodhisattva good will said   the realm of birth and death and that of nirvana form a dualism . but if one sees the true nature of birth and death  one sees that there is no birth or death  no binding  no unbinding  no birth2 no extinction . one who understands in this way may thereby enter the gate of nondualism .  the bodhisattva direct seeing said   the exhaustible and the inexhaustible form a dualism . but whether dharmas are in the end exhaustible or inexhaustible  they are all without the marks of exhaustibility . and if they are without the marks of exhaustibility  they are empty and if they are empty  they are without the marks either of exhaustibility or inexhaustibility . if one enters this realm of understanding  one my thereby enter the gate of nondualism .  the bodhisattva universal guardian said   i  and noti  form a dualism . but when one can not grasp even i   how can one grasp noti   one who has seen into the true nature of i  will no longer give rise to these two concepts  and in this way enter the gate of nondualism .  the bodhisattva lightning god said   enlightenment and ignorance form a dualism . but the true nature of ignorance is none other than enlightenment . and enlightenment can not be seized  but is apart from all enumerations . one dwells in the center  in the equality without dualism  and in this way enters the gate of nondualism .  the bodhisattva joyful seeing said   form and the emptiness of form constitute a dualism . but form is none other than emptiness  emptiness does not represent the extinction of form . form is itself empty by nature . in the same way perception  conception  volition  and consciousness  and the emptiness of consciousness  constitute dualisms . but consciousness is none other than emptiness  emptiness does not represent the extinction of consciousness . consciousness is itself empty by nature.3 dwelling in the midst of these concepts and understanding them thoroughly  one may in this way enter the gate of nondualism .  2 in place of sheng   birth   some texts read jan   burning   that is  no burning of the fire of passion  no putting out of the fire . the bodhisattva enlightened as to form said   to regard the four elements  earth  water  fire  and wind  as different from the element emptiness or space is dualistic . the nature of the four elements is none other than the nature of emptiness . just as the past and future of these elements is empty  so too must their present be empty . if one can understand the nature of the elements in this way  one may thereby enter the gate of nondualism .  the bodhisattva wonderful will said   the eye and the objects it observes constitute a dualism . but if one understands the nature of the eye  then with regard to objects one will be without greed  without anger  and without stupidity . this is called tranquil extinction . similarly  the ear and sounds  the nose and smells  the tongue and tastes  the body and touch  and the mind and phenomena constitute dualisms . but if one understands the nature of the mind  then with regard to phenomena one will be without greed  without anger  and without stupidity . this is called tranquil extinction . dwelling at rest in its midst  one may thereby enter the gate of nondualism .  3 the text spells out the argument in full only in the case of the first and last terms in the series  form and consciousness  but the same argument applies to the other terms  perception  conception  and volition . this same type of abbreviated construction is used in the next answer and in several of those that follow . the bodhisattva inexhaustible will said   almsgiving  and applying the merits gained thereby to acquire comprehensive wisdom  constitute a dualism . but the nature of almsgiving is none other than the applying of merits to acquire comprehensive wisdom . similarly  keeping of the precepts  forbearance  assiduousness  meditation  and wisdom form dualisms in contrast to the applying of merit to acquire comprehensive wisdom  etc . but the nature of wisdom is none other than the applying of merits to acquire comprehensive wisdom . by entering into an understanding of the singleness of form that all these share  one may thus enter the gate of nondualism .  the bodhisattva deep wisdom said   this is emptiness  this is formlessness  this is nonactionto speak in this manner is dualistic . emptiness is none other than formlessness  formlessness is none other than nonaction . if something is empty  formless  nonacting  then it is without mind  will  or consciousness . this single doctrine of emancipation is the same as the threefold doctrine of emancipation  regarding emptiness  formlessness  and nonaction  . in this way one enters the gate of nondualism .  the bodhisattva tranquil roots said   to speak of the buddha  the law  and the assembly is dualistic . the buddha is none other than the law  the law is none other than the assembly . these three treasures are all uncreated in form  like the empty sky  and all dharmas are the same . one who can act in accordance with this understanding may thereby enter the gate of nondualism .  the bodhisattva mind unobstructed said   the body and the body extinguished constitute a dualism . but the body is none other than the body extinguished . why  because one who sees into the true form of the body does not give rise to thoughts of seeing the body or seeing the extinction of the body the body and the extinction of the body are not two things  not a distinction to be made . one who rests in this understanding  neither alarmed nor fearful  may in this way enter the gate of nondualism .  the bodhisattva superior goodness said   to speak of the activities of body  mouth  and mind is dualistic . these three activities are all marked by the aspect of nonaction . if the body is marked by nonaction  then the mouth must be marked by nonaction  and if the mouth is marked by nonaction  then the mind must be marked by nonaction . and since these three activities are marked by nonaction  then all dharmas must be marked by nonaction . one who can go along with this wisdom of nonaction may in this way enter the gate of nondualism .  the bodhisattva merit field said   to speak of meritorious deeds  blameful deeds  and deeds that call forth no retribution is dualistic . the true nature of all three kinds of deeds is empty . and if it is empty  then there are no meritorious deeds  no blameful deeds  and no deeds that call forth no retribution . one who does not rouse any thought of distinctions with regard to these three types of deeds may thereby enter the gate of nondualism .  the bodhisattva flower garland said   from the concept of self  rises the concept of two things   self and other   which creates a dualism . but one who sees into the true form of the self will not give rise to the thought of two things . and if one does not dwell in the thought of two things  then one will be without consciousness and without anything one is conscious of  and in this way may enter the gate of nondualism .  the bodhisattva virtue storehouse said   to suppose that there is some form or object that one can acquire is dualistie . but if one realizes that there is nothing to be acquired  then there will be no grasping and no rejecting . and when there is no grasping and no rejecting  one may in this way enter the gate of nondualism .  the bodhisattva moon in midair said   darkness and light form a dualism  if there is no darkness and no light  there will be no dualism . why  it is like entering the meditation that wipes out perception and conception  where there is neither darkness nor light . and the forms of all dharmas are the same as this . if one enters this state and views all with equality  one may thereby enter the gate of nondualism .  the bodhisattva treasure sign said   to yearn for nirvana and not delight in the world constitutes a dualism . but if one does not yearn for nirvana and does not loathe the world  there will be no dualism . why  if there is binding  there will be unbinding . but if there is no binding to begin with  who will seek to be unbound  and where there is no binding and unbinding  there will be no yearning and no loathing  and in this way one may enter the gate of nondualism .  the bodhisattva jewel crowned king said   the correct way and the erroneous way constitute a dualism . but one who dwells in the correct way does not make distinctions  saying this is erroneous   or this is correct   by removing oneself from both  one may thereby enter the gate of nondualism .  the bodhisattva delight in truth said   the true and the not true form a dualism . but one who sees truly can not even see the true  so how can he see the untrue  why  because they can not be seen by the physical eye  only the eye of wisdom can see them . but for this eye of wisdom there is no seeing and no not seeing . in this way one may enter the gate of nondualism .  when the various bodhisattvas had finished one by one giving their explanations  they asked manjushri   how then does the bodhisattva enter the gate of nondualism   manjushri replied   to my way of thinking  all dharmas are without words  without explanations  without purport  without cognition  removed from all questions and answers . in this way one may enter the gate of nondualism .  then manjushri said to vimalakirti   each of us has given an explanation . now  sir  it is your turn to speak . how does the bodhisattva enter the gate of nondualism   at that time vimalakirti remained silent and did not speak a word . manjushri sighed and said   excellent  excellent  not a word  not a syllablethis truly is to enter the gate of nondualism   when this chapter on entering the gate of nondualism was preached  five thousand bodhisattvas in the assembly were all able to enter the gate of nondualism and to learn to accept the truth of birthlessness . chapter 10 fragrance accumulated at that time shariputra thought to himself   it is almost noon . what are all these bodhisattvas going to eat   then vimalakirti  knowing what was in his mind  said   the buddha preached the eight emancipations . you  sir  should undertake to practice them . why be distracted by thoughts of eating when you are listening to the law  if you want something to eat  wait a moment . i will see that you get the sort of food you have never had before   vimalakirti then entered samadhi and  employing his transcendental powers  showed the great assembly a country called many fragrances  situated in a region high above  beyond buddha lands as numerous as the sands of fortytwo ganges . the buddha named fragrance accumulated was at that time present there . the fragrance of his country was finer than the fragrance of all the human and heavenly realms of the buddha lands of the ten directions . in his land there was not even the term voicehearer or pratyekabuddha  but only great bodhisattvas  pure and clean  for whom the buddha preached the law . all the inhabitants of his world built their halls and towers out of fragrances  strolled the fragrant ground  and had gardens all made of fragrances . the fragrant aroma of their food wafted to immeasurable worlds in the ten directions . at this time the buddha and the various bodhisattvas were just sitting down together to eat . heavenly offspring  all named fragrant garland  all with their minds set on attaining anuttarasamyaksambodhi  were serving the meal to the buddha and the bodhisattvas . among the great assembly  gathered at vimalakirti s house   there were none who could not see these things with their own eyes . then vimalakirti addressed the bodhisattvas  saying   sirs  who among you can bring us some of that buddhã¡ s food   out of deference to manjushri s authority and supernatural powers  however  all of them remained silent .  addressing manjushri   vimalakirti said   sir  a great assembly such as thisthis is shameful  is it not   manjushri replied   as the buddha has told us  never despise those who have yet to learn .  thereupon vimalakirti  without rising from his seat but in the presence of the whole gathering  conjured up a phantom bodhisattva whose auspicious features  shining brightness  authority and virtue were so superior that they outshone the entire group . then he announced to this bodhisattva   you must go to the region high above  beyond buddha lands numerous as the sands of fortytwo ganges  where there is a country called many fragrances . the buddha  named fragrance accumulated  is just now sitting down with his bodhisattvas to a meal . when you arrive in his presence  speak as i instruct you  saying  vimalakirti bows his head before the feet of the worldhonored one with immeasurable reverence and begs to inquire if in your daily activities your illnesses are few  your worries are few does your strength suffice you  he desires to obtain the leftovers from this meal of the worldhonored one so he may carry out the buddha s work by dispensing them in the saha world  enabling those who delight in a lesser doctrine to be broadened by the great way  and also to cause the thus come one s fame to be heard on all sides .   at that time this conjured bodhisattva in the presence of the gathering ascended to the region high above . everyone in the entire assembly could see him as he departed  and as he arrived in the world called many fragrances and made his obeisance at the feet of the buddha there . and they could hear him say  vimalakirti bows his head before the feet of the worldhonored one with immeasurable reverence and begs to inquire if in your daily activities your illnesses are few  your worries are few . does your strength suffice you  he desires to obtain the leftovers from this meal of the worldhonored one so he may carry out the buddha s work by dispensing them in the saha world  ensuring that those who delight in a lesser doctrine will be broadened by the great way  and also that the thus come one s fame may be heard on all sides .  when the great men  of the country many fragrances  saw this conjured bodhisattva  they sighed at seeing what they had never seen before  and said   where has this superior being come from  the saha worldwhere is that  what is this thing he calls alesser doctrine    1 when they had put these questions to their buddha  the buddha announced to them   in the lower region  beyond buddha lands as numerous as the sands of fortytwo ganges  there is a world called saha . the buddha named shakyamuni is at present manifesting himself in that evil world of the five impurities in order to expound the teachings of the way to living beings who delight in a lesser doctrine . he has a bodhisattva named vimalakirti who dwells in the emancipation beyond comprehension and preaches the law for the other bodhisattvas . he has purposely dispatched this phantom being to come and extol my name and praise this land  so that thereby he may bring increased benefits to those bodhisattvas .  the bodhisattvas said   how can this man conjure up a phantom such as this  does he possess such strength of virtue  such fearlessness  such transcendental powers   1 the inhabitants of the country many fragrances  as we have been told earlier  have never even heard of voicehearers or pratyekabuddhas . the buddha replied   his powers are great indeed  he dispatches phantoms in all the ten directions to carry out the buddha s work and bring enrichment to living beings .  then the thus come one fragrance accumulated took a bowl of many fragrances  filled it with fragrant rice  and gave it to the phantom bodhisattva . at that time the nine million bodhisattvas all spoke out in unison  saying   we wish to visit that saha world and offer alms to shakyamuni buddha . and we also wish to see vimalakirti and the many other bodhisattvas .   you may go   said the buddha .  but draw in your bodily fragrances so that you will not cause living beings to be deluded or beguiled by them . and you should put aside your real form so that the persons in that country who are striving to become bodhisattvas will not feel intimidated or ashamed . and you must not look on that land with disdain or contempt or rouse thoughts that obstruct progress . why  because all the lands in the ten directions are as empty as the sky . it is just that  since the buddhas wish to convert those who delight in a lesser doctrine  they do not reveal the full purity of the land .  at that time the phantom bodhisattva  having received the bowl of rice  joined the nine million bodhisattvas and all  relying upon the might and supernatural power of the buddha and upon vimalakirti s power  suddenly vanished from that world and then in the space of an instant arrived at vimalakirti s house . vimalakirti immediately conjured up nine million lion seats  beautifully adorned like the ones that were already there  and the bodhisattvas all sat down in them . the bodhisattva then presented the bowl filled with fragrant rice to vimalakirti . the fragrance of the rice perfumed the entire city of vaishali and the whole thousandmillionfold world . the brahmans  lay believers  and others of vaishali  smelling this fragrant aroma  were delighted in body and mind  sighing with admiration at something they had never known before . at that time moon canopy  a leader among the rich men  accompanied by eightyfour thousand persons  came to vimalakirti s house . seeing the vast number of bodhisattvas gathered in the room and the lion seats  tall  broad  and beautifully adorned  they were aii filled with delight . after paying obeisance to the bodhisattvas and the major disciples  they retired and stood to one side . various earth deities  sky deities  and heavenly beings of the world of desire and the world of form  smelling the fragrant aroma  all likewise came to vimalakirti s house . then vimalakirti said to shariputra and the other great voicehearers   sirs  come eat this rice from the thus come one  delicious as sweet dew it is redolent with the odor of great pity . but you must not eat it in a narrowminded manner  or you will never digest it   some of the other voicehearers thought to themselves   there is only a little ricehow can it feed all the people in this great assembly   but the phantom bodhisattva said   do not try to use your voicehearers  petty virtue and petty wisdom in appraising the immeasurable blessings and wisdom of the thus come one  though the four seas run dry  this rice will never come to an end . every person here could eat helpings the size of mount sumeru  and do so for a whole kalpa  but still it would never be exhausted . why  because this is the ieftovers from a meal eaten by persons who have acquired inexhaustible merits through the precepts  meditation  wisdom  emancipation  and the insight of emancipation . therefore it can never be exhausted .  the rice in the bowl was then used to feed to satisfaction all the members of the assembly  yet it remained as it was  without any sign of depletion . the bodhisattvas  voicehearers  and heavenly and human beings who ate the rice had a sense of bodily ease and delight of mind  iike the bodhisattvas in the country of all delights and adornments . and a wonderful fragrance emanated from the pores of all of them  like the fragrance of the trees in the iand called many fragrances . at that time vimalakirti asked the bodhisattvas from the country many fragrances   how does the thus come one fragrance accumulated preach the law   the bodhisattvas replied   the thus come one in our land does not employ words in his exposition . he just uses various fragrances to induce heavenly and human beings to undertake the observance of the precepts . each bodhisattva sits under a fragrant tree  and when he smells the marvelous fragrance  he immediately attains the samadhi known as the storehouse of all virtues . persons who are able to attain this samadhi all become endowed with the blessings of a bodhisattva .  the bodhisattvas then asked vimalakirti   now how does the worldhonored one shakyamuni preach the law   vimalakirti replied   the living beings of this land are stubborn and strongwilled and hard to convert . therefore the buddha uses strong language when preaching to them in order to tame and control them . he says  this is hell  this is the realm of beasts  this is the realm of hungry spirits  these are the difficult conditions  this is the place where stupid people are born . these are misdeeds of the body  these are the retribution for misdeeds of the body . these are misdeeds of the mouth  these are the retribution for misdeeds of the mouth . these are misdeeds of the mind  these are the retribution for misdeeds of the mind .  this is the killing of living beings  this is the retribution for killing living beings . this is taking what has not been given to you  this is the retribution for taking what has not been given to you . this is sexual misconduct  this is the retribution for sexual misconduct . this is lying  this is the retribution for lying . this is being doubletongued  this is the retribution for being doubletongued . this is harsh speech  this is the retribution for harsh speech . this is specious talk  this is the retribution for specious talk . this is greed  this is the retribution for greed . this is wrath  this is the retribution for wrath .  these are erroneous views  this is the retribution for erroneous views . this is stinginess  this is the retribution for stinginess . this is breaking the precepts  this is the retribution for breaking the precepts . this is anger  this is the retribution for anger . this is sloth  this is the retribution for sloth . this is distractedness  this is the retribution for distractedness . this is stupidity  this is the retribution for stupidity .  this is accepting the precepts  this is keeping the precepts  this is violating the precepts . this is what ought to be done  this is what ought not to be done . this is creating obstacles  this is not creating obstacles . this is incurring blame  this is avoiding blame . this is purity  this is defilement . this is to have outflows  this is to be free of outflows . this is the wrong way  this is the correct way . this is the conditioned  this is the unconditioned . this is the mundane world  this is nirvana .   these people who are difficult to convert have minds like monkeys . therefore one must resort to various methods in order to control and regulate their minds . only then can they be tamed and made obedient . it is like dealing with an elephant or horse that is wild and unruly one must apply sharp blows  till it feels them in its bones  and then it can be tamed . and it is the same with these stubborn and strongwilled beings who are difficult to convert . therefore one uses all sorts of bitter and piercing words  and then they can be made to observe the precepts .  when those bodhisattvas had finished listening to this explanation  they all exclaimed   we have never heard of such a thing before  a worldhonored one like shakyamuni who conceals his immeasurable powers of freedom and preaches the law in a manner that will please the mean in spirit in order to save and liberate all beings  and these bodhisattvashow zealous of them  in their immeasurably great pity  to condescend to be born in this buddha land   vimalakirti said   the bodhisattvas of this land are indeed steadfast in their great pity for all living beings . it is just as you have said . and the enrichment and benefit they bring to living beings in one lifetime here is greater than that bestowed in other worlds over the space of a hundred thousand kalpas . why  because in this saha world there are ten good practices that do not exist in any of those pure lands .  what are these ten  almsgiving  which does away with poverty and destitution . pure precepts  which do away with violation of the prohibitions . forbearance  which does away with anger . assiduousness  which does away with sloth . meditation  which does away with distractedness of mind . wisdom  which does away with stupidity . the explanation of how to remove oneself from difficulties  which saves those who face the eight difficulties . the doctrine of the great vehicle  which saves those who delight in the lesser vehicle . the cultivation of good roots  which rescues those who are lacking in virtue . and the four ways of winning people  which are constantly employed to guide living beings to success . these are the ten .  the bodhisattvas said   what methods must these bodhisattvas carry out in their practices in this saha world so that they may be born free of boils and sores in a pure land   2 vimalakirti replied   these bodhisattvas must carry out eight methods in their practices in this world in order to be born free of boils and sores in a pure land . what are these eight  they must enrich and benefit living beings but look for no recompense . they must take upon themselves the sufferings of all living beings  and what merit they acquire thereby shall all be a gift to those beings . in mind they must be like other living beings  humbling themselves  descending to their level  erecting no barriers . they shall regard other bodhisattvas as though they were looking at the buddha himself . when they hear a sutra they have not heard before  they shall not doubt it  and they shall not dispute with or oppose the voicehearers . they shall not envy the alms received by others  nor boast of their own gains . in carrying out these methods  they must regulate and control their minds  constantly reflecting on their own faults and not censuring the shortcomings of others . at all times they shall with a single mind strive to acquire merits . these are the eight methods .  2 that is  free of physical ills or defects . such ills would indicate that the bodhisattva s religious practice had been faulty . when vimalakirti and manjushri expounded these teachings to the great assembly  a hundred thousand heavenly and human beings all set their minds on attaining anuttarasamyaksambodhi  and ten thousand bodhisattvas were able to accept the truth of birthlessness . chapter 11 actions of the bodhisattvas at that time the buddha was in the amra gardens preaching the law when the ground suddenly became broad and beautifully adorned  and all the persons assembled there took on a golden color . ananda said to the buddha   worldhonored one  what is the reason for this auspicious sign  the area has become suddenly broadened and adorned  and the members of the assembly have all taken on a golden color   the buddha said to ananda   vimalakirti and manjushri  reverently surrounded by a great gathering of persons  have decided to come here . therefore this auspicious sign has first of all appeared .  at that moment vimalakirti said to manjushri   let us go together to see the buddha and join the bodhisattvas in paying obeisance and making offerings .  manjushri said   excellent  we will go indeed . this is just the time to do so .  vimalakirti  employing his supernatural powers  proceeded to pick up the whole great assembly  along with their lion seats  place them in the palm of his right hand  and journey with them to the place where the buddha was . after arriving there and depositing them on the ground  he bowed his head at the feet of the buddha  circled to the right  performing seven circumambulations of the buddha and  pressing his palms together with a single mind  stood to one side . the bodhisattvas all immediately left their seats  bowed their heads at the buddha s feet  performed seven circumambulations  and stood to one side . the major disciples  brahmas  indras  and four heavenly kings all likewise left their seats  bowed their heads at the buddha s feet  and stood to one side . then the buddha  after making the customary greetings and inquiries  sent them back to their seats . after all of them  following his instructions  had settled again in their seats  the buddha said to shariputra   did you see what these bodhisattvas  these great men  did through their freely exercised supernatural powers    yes  i saw it .   and what did you think of it    worldhonored one  what i saw them do was incredible . my mind can not comprehend it  it is beyond my fathoming   at that time ananda said to the buddha   worldhonored one  this fragrance i smell is like nothing i have ever known . what fragrance is this   the buddha replied to ananda   this is the fragrance that comes from the pores of these bodhisattvas .  then shariputra said to ananda   our pores too put forth this fragrance    where does it come from   asked ananda .  it comes from the rice left over from the buddha s meal that the rich man vimalakirti had brought from the country many fragrances   replied shariputra .  the pores of everyone who ate it at his house emit this kind of fragrance .  then ananda asked vimalakirti   how long will this fragrant aroma last   vimalakirti said   until the rice is digested .   and how long will it be before the rice is digested    the power of this rice is such that it will be seven days before it is digested . moreover  ananda  if voicehearers who have not yet reached the stage of ultimate determination eat this rice  they will be able to digest it only after they reach that stage . and if persons who have already reached that stage eat this rice  they will be able to digest it only after they have gained liberation of mind . if those who have not yet set their minds on attaining the great vehicle eat this rice  they will have to set their minds on that before they can digest it . if those who have already set their minds on doing so eat this rice  they will have to accept the truth of birthlessness before they can digest it . if those who have already accepted the truth of birthlessness eat this rice  they will have to advance to the place where buddhahood is assured them in their next birth before they can digest it . it is like the medicine called superior flavor that remains undigested until all the poisons in the body of the person who takes it have been eliminated . this rice is the sameonly after all the poisons of earthly desires have been wiped out will it be digested .  ananda said to the buddha   i have never heard of such a thing  worldhonored oneto think that this fragrant rice can be used to do the buddha s work   the buddha said   just so  just so  ananda . and there are some buddha lands where the radiant light of the buddha is used to do the buddha s work . some where bodhisattvas are used to do the buddha s work . some where phantom beings conjured up by the buddha are used for the buddha s work . some where the bodhi tree is used for the buddha s work . some where the buddha s garments or bedding are used for the buddha s work . some where the buddha s food is used for the buddha s work . some where gardens  groves  pavilions  and towers are used to do the buddha s work . some where the thirtytwo features and eighty characteristics  auspicious marks that accompany the body of the buddha  are used to do the buddha s work . some where the buddha s body is used for the buddha s work . and some where empty space is used for the buddha s work . living beings  responding to these various agents  are thereby led to undertake the practice of the precepts .  there are lands where similes such as dreams  phantoms  reflections  echoes  images in a mirror  the moon in the water  or shimmering heat waves are used to do the buddha s work . there are some where voices  spoken words  or written words are used to do the buddha s work . or pure buddha lands where tranquil silence  without words  without explanations  without purport  without cognition  without action  without conditioning  does the buddha s work . thus  ananda  among all daily activities of the buddhas  their comings and goings  every act that they carry out  there is not one that does not do the buddha s work .  ananda  there is a gate known as the four devils and the eightyfour thousand earthly desires . living beings are wearied and belabored by these devils and desires  but the buddhas use this as a method by which to do the buddha s work . this is called the dharma gate of entry to all buddhas . bodhisattvas who have entered this gate  when they see buddha lands replete with all manner of purity and beauty  will not for that reason feel delight or longing or elation  and when they see buddha lands with all sorts of impurities  they will not feel sad or vexed or downcast . they will merely regard the buddhas with renewed purity of mind  experiencing a joy and reverence they have never known before . the merits of the various buddhas  the thus come ones  are all equal  but in order to convert living beings  they manifest themselves in different kinds of buddha lands .  ananda  look at the various buddha lands . the land in them is varied  but there is no variation in the sky . and it is the same when you look at the various buddhas . their physical bodies are varied  but that is all . there is no variation in their unimpeded wisdom . ananda  a physical body  impressive features  lineage  precepts  meditation  wisdom  emancipations  the insight of emancipations  powers  fearlessnesses  properties not shared by others  great compassion  great pity  the observance of proper demeanor  as well as a fixed life span  the power to preach the law  to teach and convert others  to lead living beings to enlightenment  to purify the buddha lands  and to assimilate the law of other buddhasall these are possessed equally by all the various buddhas . therefore they are called samyaksambuddha  perfectly enlightened buddha   they are called tathagata  thus come one   they are called buddha  enlightened one  .  ananda  if i were to explain to you in detail the meaning of these three epithets  you could live for a whole kalpa and still not hear all i have to say . even if all the living beings in the thousandmillionfold world were like you  ananda  who are foremost in hearing the teachings and concentrating on and retaining all you have heard  and they were to live for a whole kalpa  they could not hear it all . so it is  anandathe anuttarasamyaksambodhi of the buddhas is beyond fathoming  and their wisdom and eloquence defy comprehension .  ananda said to the buddha   from now on  i will never dare think of myself as a person who has heard many of the teachings .   the buddha said to ananda   do nt be discouraged  why  because when i spoke of you as foremost among the voicehearers in the volume of teachings you have heard  i was not speaking with the bodhisattvas in mind . so do not take the matter to heart  ananda . no wise person should try to estimate the abilities of the bodhisattvas . all the deepest places in the sea can still be fathomed  but the meditation  wisdom  power to retain the teachings  eloquence  and all the various merits of the bodhisattvas are immeasurable . ananda  you and the others had best forget about the actions of the bodhisattvas . this manifestation of supernatural power that vimalakirti has just now shown us no voicehearer or pratyekabuddha could equal in a hundred thousand kalpas  no matter how he might exhaust his powers of transformation   then the bodhisattvas who had come from the world many fragrances pressed their palms together and addressed the buddha  saying   woridhonored one  when we first saw this land  we thought of it as base and inferior . but now we regret our error and have put such thoughts out of our minds . why  because the expedient means employed by the buddhas are beyond comprehension . in order to save living beings  they manifest different kinds of buddha lands  depending upon what is appropriate to the circumstances . very well then  worldhonored one . we would like you to bestow a little of your teachings on us so that when we return to our own land we will have something to remember the thus come one by .  the buddha announced to the bodhisattvas   there is the doctrine of the exhaustible and the inexhaustible emancipation . you would do well to learn this . what does exhaustible mean  it means those things that are conditioned . what does inexhaustible mean  it means those things that are unconditioned . but beings such as the bodhisattvas do not exhaust  or have done with  the conditioned  nor do they dwell in the unconditioned .  what is meant by not exhausting the conditioned  it means not setting aside great compassion  not renouncing great pity  giving profound expression to the mind of comprehensive wisdom and never forgetting it  teaching and converting living beings without ever wearying  being constantly mindful of the four methods of winning people and applying them in season  guarding and upholding the correct law without thought for life or limb . it means to work tirelessly to plant the roots of goodness  to keep the will at all times fixed on expedient means and the transfer of merit to others  to seek the law without ever slacking  to preach the law without ever stinting . it means diligently making offerings to the buddhas  purposely entering the realm of birth and death with no feelings of fear  facing all types of honor or disgrace without thought of sadness or joy  not looking with contempt on those who have yet to learn and respecting the learned as though they were the buddha himself . it means arousing correct thoughts in those sunk in earthly desires  but without unduly prizing the desire to remove oneself from passion . one should not cling to one s own desires  but applaud the desires of others .  it means looking on meditational states as though they were a form of hell  but on the realm of birth and death as though contemplating a garden  viewing those who come seeking instruction with thoughts of how one may be a good teacher  setting aside one s own possessions and thinking how to acquire comprehensive wisdom  seeing those who violate the precepts and rousing thoughts of how to save them .  it means thinking of the paramitas as one s father and mother  thinking of the elements of the way as one s retinue of followers  working ceaselessly to nourish the roots of goodness  using the adornments of other pure lands to complete a buddha land of one s own  practicing unbounded charity and thereby acquiring auspicious physical characteristics  putting aside all evil and purifying body  mouth  and mind  dwelling in the realm of birth and death for countless kalpas  ever valiant in mind  listening to the immeasurable virtues of the buddha  one s determination never flagging  using the sword of wisdom to cut down the thieves of earthly desires  going beyond the realm of components  elements  and sensemedia  shouldering the burden of living beings and bringing them to unending emancipation  employing great assiduousness in driving back and vanquishing the armies of the devil  constantly seeking to practice the wisdom that is without discriminative thought  the true aspect of reality  with regard to worldly things  lessening desires  knowing what is enough  with regard to unworldly things  tirelessly seeking them  and yet not rejecting the things of the world .  it means never breaking the rules of proper demeanor  yet being able to accommqdate to worldly ways  calling up transcendental powers and wisdom and using them to guide living beings  acquiring concentration and retention of memory so that one never forgets what one has heard  being able to distinguish the different capacities of people correctly and freeing them from doubt  expounding the law with a pleasing and appropriate eloquence that flows unimpeded  scrupulously carrying out the ten good actions and receiving the blessings of human and heavenly beings  cultivating the four immeasurable qualities of mind and opening up the brahma way  earnestly requesting to hear the preaching of the law and receiving it with joy and commendation  acquiring the voice of the buddha and the excellence of his body  mouth  and mind  acquiring his proper demeanor  practicing his good law with profound diligence  ever more accomplished in action  using the great vehicle teachings to create a community of bodhisattvas  never selfindulgent in mind  never missing an opportunity for acts of goodnessone who practices these methods may be called a bodhisattva who does not exhaust the conditioned .  what is meant by saying that the bodhisattva does not dwell in the unconditioned  it means that one studies and practices the teachings on emptiness  but does not take emptiness to be enlightenment . one studies and practices the teachings on nonform and nonaction  but does not take nonform and nonaction to be enlightenment . one studies and practices the teachings on nonarousal  of causes   but does not take nonarousal to be enlightenment . one views things as impermanent  but does not neglect to cultivate the roots of goodness . one views the world as marked by suffering  but does not hate to be born and die in it . one sees that there is no permanent ego  but is tireless in instructing others . one sees that there is such a thing as tranquil extinction  but does not dwell in extinction for long . one views the world as something to be cast off  withdrawn from  yet with body and mind one practices goodness . one sees there is no destination  yet one makes the good law one s destination . one sees there is no birth  yet one takes on the form of birth in order to share the burdens of others . one sees that outflows  of passion  should be cut off  yet one does not cut them off . one sees that there is nothing to be practiced  yet one practices the law in order to teach and convert living beings . one embraces the view of emptiness and nothingness  yet does not discard one s great pity . one embraces the view that the correct law  nirvana  can be attained  yet one does not follow lesser vehicle doctrines in this matter . one embraces the view that all phenomena are void and false  lacking firmness  lacking personality  lacking a master  lacking form  yet while one s original vow remains unfulfilled  one does not regard merits  virtues  meditation  or wisdom as meaningless . when one practices these methods  one may be called a bodhisattva who does not dwell in the unconditioned .  at that time those bodhisattvas  having heard the explanation of this teaching  were all filled with great delight . selecting from among the many wonderful flowers those of various colors and various fragrances  they scattered them throughout the whole thousandmillionfold world . and then  having made their offering to the buddha and to these sutra teachings  as well as to the other bodhisattvas  they bowed their heads in obeisance at the buddha s feet and sighed at having heard what they had never heard before  exclaiming   shakyamuni buddha knows how to employ expedient means in a truly skillful manner   having spoken these words  they suddenly vanished from sight and returned to their own country . chapter 12 seeing akshobhya buddha at that time the worldhonored one said to vimalakirti   you wanted to see the thus come one . now how do you regard the thus come one   vimalakirti said   as i would regard my own true form or realityin that same way do i regard the thus come one . i regard the thus come one as not existing from past times  not departing in the future  not abiding here at present .  i do not regard him as form  i do not regard him as resembling form  i do not regard him as having the nature of form . i do not regard him as perception  conception  volition  or consciousness . i do not regard him as resembling consciousness . i do not regard him as having the nature of consciousness.l  he does not rise out of the four great elements but is the same as the empty sky . he is without accumulation of the six sensemedia  he has transcended eye  ear  nose  tongue  body  and mind  and does not exist in the threefold world . he has separated himself from the three defilements  of greed  anger  and stupidity   passed through the three gates to emancipation  and acquired the three understandings  which are the equivalent of ignorance .  he is not identical in form with others  not different in form  not of his own form  not of some other form  not lacking form  not acquiring form . he is not on this shore  not on the other shore  not in midstream  and yet he converts living beings . 1 vimalakirti spells out the full process of negation only for the first and last of the five components  form and consciousness  but it is assumed that the same negations apply to the other three  perception  conception  and volition . he is seen to be in tranquil extinction  but does not remain in extinction for long . he is not this  he is not that  he does not show himself in this  he does not show himself in that . one cannot know him through wisdom  one can not be conscious of him through consciousness . he is without darkness  without brightness  without name  without form  without strength  without weakness . he is not pure  not defiled  not in any direction  not removed from direction  not conditioned  not unconditioned  without purport  without explanation . he is not charitable  not stingy  does not observe the precepts  does not violate them  is not forbearing  not irate  does not press forward  does not slack  is not calm in mind  is not distracted  is not wise  is not stupid  is not sincere  is not deceitful  does nct arrive  does not depart  does not go out  does not enter in . he is cut off from all that can be said in words .  he is not a field that produces merit  not a field that does not produce merit  he is not worthy of alms  he is not unworthy of alms . he is not to be acquired  not to be put aside  does not possess form  is not without form . he is identical with the ultimate reality  one with the dharmanature .  he can not be labeled  can not be measured  for he is beyond all labeling and measuring . he is not big  not little  not to be seen  not to be heard  not to be awakened to  not to be known . he is removed from all ties and bonds  equal to all wisdoms  identical with living beings  free of distinctions with regard to things . he is utterly without loss  without contamination  without anxiety  without action  without rousing  without birth  without extinction  without fear  without sorrow  without joy  without weariness  without attachment  without a past existence  without a future existence  without a present existence . no words or explanations whatsoever can distinguish and depict him .  worldhonored one  the body of the thus come one is like this and this is the way i regard him . to regard in this manner is called correct regarding . to regard in any other is called erroneous regarding .  at that time shariputra asked vimalakirti   where did you die before you were reborn here   vimalakirti said   in the law that you learned  is there any such thing as dying or being born   shariputra replied   no  there is no dying or being born .   if all things are without the nature of dying or being born  then why do you ask where i died before i was reborn here  what is your opinion  do phantom men and women conjured up by a magician know anything of dying or being born    no  there is no dying or being born for them .   and have you not heard the buddha say that all things are in the nature of conjured beings    yes   replied shariputra .  if all things are in the nature of conjured beings  then why do you ask where i died before i was reborn here  shariputra  dyã­ng is in its nature simply the destruction of something that is empty and fraudulent  and being born is in its nature the continuation of something that is empty and fraudulent . but the bodhisattva  though he dies  does not wipe out his good roots  and though he is born  he does not prolong those things that are evil .  at that time the buddha said to shariputra   there is a country called wonderful joy with a buddha named immovable  akshobhya  . vimalakirti here died in that country and was reborn in this one .  shariputra said   i have never heard of such a thing  worldhonored one  that this man could bring himself to abandon a land of purity and willingly come to this place with all its wrath and injury   vimalakirti said to shariputra   what is your opinion  when the light of the sun shines forth  does it mix with the darkness    no   replied shariputra .  when the light of the sun shines forth  all darkness at once ceases to exist .  vimalakirti said   and the sunwhy does it visit this continent of jambudvipa    because it wishes to use its brightness to drive the darkness away  replied shariputra . vimalakirti said   the bodhisattva is like this . though he is born in an impure buddha land  he does this so he can convert living beings . he does not mix with or share its stupidity and darkness . he merely wipes out the darkness of earthly desires that besets living beings .  at that time the members of the great assembly were filled with longing  desiring to see the wonderful joy world and the thus come one immovable and his host of bodhisattvas and voicehearers . the buddha knew what all the members of the assembly were thinking  and he said to vimalakirti   good man  you must make the land wonderful joy and the thus come one immovable and his host of bodhisattvas and voicehearers visible to the members of this assembly . they all long to see them   then vimalakirti thought to himself   now  without rising from my seat  i shall take this country wonderful joy  with its iron encircling mountains and rivers  its valleys  waterways  great seas  fountains  its sumeru and the other mountains  along with its sun  moon  stars  the palaces of the heavenly beings  dragons  spirits  brahmas and indras  as well as its host of bodhisattvas and voicehearers  its cities  villages  men and women  old and young  along with the thus come one immovable and the bodhi trees and wonderful lotus blossoms that are able to carry out the buddha s work in the ten directions  the jeweled straircases that extend from the continent of jambudvipa all the way up to the trayastrimsha heaven  the jeweled stairways by which the heavenly beings may descend and all pay reverence to the thus come one immovable and listen to and receive his sutra teachings  and the inhabitants of jambudvipa may also ascend these stairways to the trayastrimsha heaven and visit its heavenly beings  for the world wonderful joy is replete with immeasurable merits such as these  extending upward to the akanishtha heaven and downward to its watery baseand all this i shall lift from its place and take in my right hand  as though removing it from a potter s wheel  and bring it here to this world  like some flower garland i am holding  and show it to all these beings   having had this thought  he entered samadhi and  manifesting his transcendental powers  lifted the wonderful joy world out of its place with his right hand and set it down on the ground  in this world  . the host of bodhisattvas and voicehearers and the various heavenly and human beings in that world who had acquired transcendental knowledge all cried out together  saying   look  worldhonored one  someone is making off with us  save and protect us  we beg of you   but the buddha immovable said   this is not my doing . this is the work of vimalakirti s supernatural powers .  and the rest of the beings in that world who had not yet acquired transcendental knowledge did not even realize or know where they had gotten to . but although the wonderful joy world had been placed on the ground in this world  it had not increased or decreased in size  and this world likewise had in no way become cramped or narrow  but was no different from what it had always been . then shakyamuni buddha addressed his great assembly  saying   do you see the wonderful joy world  the thus come one immovable  and the splendid adornments of his land  the purity of the practices carried out by his bodhisattvas  the impeccable cleanness of his major disciples   all replied   yes  we have seen them .  the buddha said   if bodhisattvas wish to acquire a buddha land as pure and spotless as this  they should study the way practiced by the thus come one immovable .  when this wonderful joy country appeared in the saha world  fourteen nayutas of persons set their minds on attaining anuttarasamyaksambodhi  all desiring to be born in the buddha land wonderful joy . shakyamuni thereupon gave them a prophecy  saying   you will be born in that land .  then the wonderful joy world  having finished bestowing enrichment and benefit upon this country  returned to its original place . all the members of the assembly saw it do so . the buddha addressed shariputra  saying   did you see this wonderful joy world and the buddha immovable    yes  i saw them  worldhonored one . and i beg you to enable all living beings to acquire a clean and pure land like that of the buddha immovable  and to gain transcendental powers like those of vimalakirti .  worldhonored one  i and the others have happily acquired excellent benefits  being able to see this person and to approach and make offerings to him . and other living beings  either now while the buddha is here or after he has passed away  if they hear this sutra  will acquire excellent benefits as well . and how much more so if  having heard it  they believe and understand it  accept and uphold it  read and recite it  expound it to others  and practice it as the law directs . one who holds this sutra in hand has thereby acquired the storehouse of the jewels of the law . if one reads and recites it  understands and expounds it  and practices it as the law directs  the buddhas will guard and keep in mind that person . and if there are those who give alms to such a person  let it be known that this is giving alms to the buddha . if there are those who copy and preserve these sutra scrolls  let it be known that the thus come one will visit their rooms . and if there are those who  hearing this sutra  can respond with appropriate joy  those persons will forthwith acquire comprehensive wisdom . if there are those who believe and understand this sutra  even just one four line verse of it  and can expound it to others  let it be known that such persons will forthwith receive a prophecy of the attainment of anuttarasamyaksambodhi .  chapter 13 the offering of the law at that time shakra devanam  indra  spoke up from the great assembly  addressing the buddha in these words   worldhonored one  though i have heard hundreds and thousands of sutras from the buddha and manjushri  i have never heard one with such astounding freedom of action  transcendental powers  and unfailing grasp of the true reality . according to my understanding of what the buddha has just said  if there are living beings who hear this sutra on the law  believe and understand it  accept and uphold it  read and recite it  then they will surely and without doubt acquire that law and how much more so if they practice it as the law directs . such persons will shut off all evil paths of existence and open the gates to all good ones . they will be constantly guarded and kept in mind by the buddhas  will refute the nonbuddhist teachings  overcome the devil and his animosity  cultivate and practice bodhi  and rest secure in the place of practice  following in the way trod by the thus come one .  worldhonored one  if there are persons who accept and uphold  read and recite this sutra and practice it as the law directs  then i and my followers will offer alms to them and serve them . and if there is a place among the villages or towns  the mountain forests or the broad plain where this sutra exists  then i and my followers will go there together to listen to and accept the law  and those who do not yet believe in it i will lead to belief  and to those who already believe i will be a guardian .  the buddha said   excellent  excellent  heavenly lord  it is just as you have said . and i will assist you in your joyful task . this sutra expounds in comprehensive manner the anuttarasamyaksambodhi of the buddhas of the past  future  and present  which is beyond comprehension . therefore  heavenly lord  if good men and good women accept  uphold  read  recite  and make offerings to this sutra  they are making offering to the buddhas of past  future  and present .  heavenly lord  suppose this thousandmillionfold world were as full of thus come ones as it is of sugarcane  bamboo  reeds  rice and hemp plants  or forest trees . if there were good men or good women who for the space of a kalpa  or less than a kalpa  were to revere and honor  praise and make offerings to them and provide for their wellbeing  and if after those buddhas had passed away  these persons built towers adorned with the seven treasures to house the relics from each buddha body  towers so broad they covered the four continents and so high they reached to the brahma heaven  their central pole richly decorated  and if these persons made offerings of all kinds of flowers  incense  necklaces  flags  pennants  and music  all of the most refined and wonderful kind  and did this for the space of a kalpa  or less than a kalpaheavenly lord  what is your opinion  would these persons have thereby planted the seeds of many blessings   shakra devanam replied   of many blessings indeed  worldhonored one  if i were to spend a hundred thousand million kalpas  i could never finish describing all their blessings and merits .  the buddha said to the heavenly lord   you should understand that if there are good men and good women who  on hearing this sutra on the emancipation beyond comprehension  believe  understand  accept  uphold  read  recite  and practice it  their blessings will be even greater than those of such persons . why  because the bodhi of the buddhas is all born from this sutra . the marks of bodhi are beyond limit or measure  and for that reason their blessings are immeasurable .  the buddha then said to the heavenly lord   a countless asamkhya number of kalpas in the past  there appeared in the world a buddha named medicine king  thus come one  worthy of offerings  of right and universal knowledge  perfect clarity and conduct  well gone  understanding the world  unexcelled worthy  trainer of people  teacher of heavenly and human beings  buddha  worldhonored one.l his world was called great adornment and his kalpa was called adornment . this buddha had a life span of twenty small kalpas . his voicehearer monks numbered thirtysix million nayutas and his bodhisattva monks twelve million .  heavenly lord  at that time there was a wheelturning sage king named jeweled parasol who possessed all the seven treasures and ruled over the four continents of the world . this king had a thousand sons  upright  valiant  capable of overpowering their enemies . at that time jeweled parasol came with his followers to make offerings to the thus come one medicine king  providing him with all he needed for his wellbeing . he did this for five whole kalpas  and when the five kalpas were over  he said to his sons  you too should make offerings to the buddha with the same deeply searching mind as i have shown .  the thousand sons  obeying their father s command  proceeded to make offerings to the thus come one medicine king for another five full kalpas  providing him with everything needed for his wellbeing .  one of the king s sons named moon parasol sat all alone  thinking to himself  is nt there some offering that is better than these    then  through the buddha s supernatural power  a heavenly being appeared in the sky and said  good man  the offering of the law is the finest of all offerings    the son asked  what is the offering of the law    the heavenly being replied  you should go and ask the thus come one medicine king . he will explain to you in detail the offering of the law 1 the phrases following the name of the buddha constitute the conventional ten epithets or honorable titles for a buddha .  at once the prince moon parasol went to call on the thus come one medicine king . after bowing his head in obeisance at the buddha s feet  he retired to one side and addressed the buddha  saying  worldhonored one  among all offerings  the offering of the law is the finest . but what is the offering of the law    the buddha said  good man  the offering of the law means the profound sutras preached by the buddhas . the people of this world all find them hard to believe and hard to accept  for they are wonderfully subtle and hard to make out  clean and pure and without stain . they can not be grasped through the making of distinctions or through thought . they are contained in the storehouse of the bodhisattva and are sealed with the dharani seal2 and where this seal is affixed  one reaches the level of no regression . they bring about observance of the six paramitas  the skillful discrimination of meanings  and compliance with the teachings of bodhi  and through the finest of all sutras one enters the realm of great pity and compassion . the sutras put an end to all devilish affairs and all erroneous views  conform to the teaching on causality and those on no ego  no individual  no living beings  no life span  emptiness  no form  no action  and no arousing . they enable living beings to sit in the place of practice and to turn the wheel of the law  heavenly beings  dragons  spirits  gandharvas  and the others join in praising them . they can enable living beings to enter the storehouse of the buddha law  they embrace the comprehensive wisdom of the worthies and sages and expound the way practiced by the bodhisattvas . relying on the principle of the true nature of all phenomena  they clearly set forth the doctrines of impermanence  suffering  emptiness  no ego  and tranquil extinction . they can save all living beings who violate the prohibitions  and in all dã©vils  nonbuddhist believers  and those given to greed and attachment they can inspirã© fear . buddhas  worthies  and sages join in extolling them . they turn away from the sufferings of birth and death and show instead the joy of nirvana . they are preached by the buddhas of the ten directions and the three existences of past  present  and future . 2 the seal of memory that insures full retention of the teachings .  if one hears sutras such as these  believes  understands  accepts  upholds  reads  and recites them  and by employing the power of expedient means makes distinctions and expounds them for the sake of living beings  rendering their meaning perfectly clear  one is thereby guarding and protecting the law  and this is called the offering of the law .  again  the sutras enable one to practice the teachings as the law directs  to accord with the twelvelinked chain of causation  to set aside erroneous views and accept the truth of birthlessness  to realize once and for all that there is no ego  no existence of living beings  no deviating from or disputing with the law of cause and effect  thus removing all thought of personal possession .  they teach one to rely on meaning  not on words  to rely on wisdom  not on consciousness  to rely on sutras that are complete in meaning  not on those that are incomplete in meaning  to rely on the law  not on the person  to go along with the true form of things  realizing that there is no entering in and no destination . they teach that  since ignorance in the end does not exist  so too action in the end does not exist  and so on through the other links in the twelvelinked chain of causation down to the fact that  since birth in the end does not exist  so too old age and death in the end do not exist . and when one learns to see in this manner  the twelvelinked chain of causation will cease to have any form that comes to an end  and one will no longer entertain the view that it does . this is called the finest of all offerings of the law   the buddha  shakyamuni  then said to the heavenly lord   when prince moon parasol heard medicine king buddha expound the law in this manner  he acquired a compliant tolerance of the truth of birthlessness . at once he took off his jeweled robes and the ornaments that adorned his body and offered them to the buddha  saying  worldhonored one  after the thus come one has passed into extinction  i will carry out offerings of the law and guard the correct law . i beg you  through your might and supernatural powers  to take pity on me and strengthen me so that i can conquer the devil and his enmity and practice the bodhisattva way  the buddha knew the thoughts that were in his deeply searching mind and bestowed on him a prophecy  saying  in that latter age you will guard and protect the citadel of the law .   heavenly lord  at that time prince moon parasol  observing the purity of the law and hearing this prophecy bestowed by the buddha  was moved by faith to leave the household life and take up the practice of the good law . he had not devoted himself to diligent practice for long when he was able to acquire the five transcendental powers  carry out the bodhisattva way  and gain dharani power and unflagging eloquence . after the buddha had passed into extinction  he exercised the transcendental powers he had acquired  the power to retain all he had heard  and the eloquence for fully ten small kalpas  continuing to turn the wheel of the law turned by the thus come one medicine king and spreading the teachings abroad . this monk moon parasol  by guarding and protecting the law and putting forth diligent effort  was able in the space of his lifetime to convert hundreds  thousands  millions of persons  insuring that they would never regress in their pursuit of anuttarasamyaksambodhi  to cause fourteen nayutas of others to develop a profound aspiration for the way of the voicehearer or the pratyekabuddha  and to enable countless living beings to be born in the heavenly realm .  heavenly lord  the person who was king jeweled parasol at the time i have been speaking ofwhat do you think  he has now become a buddha named jewel flame thus come one . and the king s one thousand sons will become the thousand buddhas who will appear in our present age  the worthy kalpa.3 krakucchanda was the first to attain buddhahood  and the last will be the thus come one named ruchi . the monk moon parasol is none other than myself .  thus  heavenly lord  you should understand this important point . the offering of the law is the finest of all offerings . it is first in rank and without equal . therefore  heavenly lord  you should use this offering of the law as your offering to the buddha .  3 various sutras predict that a thousand buddhas will appear in our present kalpa or eon  which is accordingly termed the worthy kalpa . shakyamuni is the fourth to appear  and maitreya will be the fifth . chapter 14 entrustment then the buddha addressed the bodhisattva maitreya  saying   maitreya  i now take this law of anuttarasamyaksambodhi  gathered over countless millions of asamkhya kalpas  and entrust it to you . in the latter age after the buddha has passed into extinction  you must employ your supernatural powers to propagate sutras such as this  spreading them throughout the continent of jambudvipa and never allowing them to be wiped out . why  because in the ages to come there will be good men and good women  as well as heavenly beings  dragons  spirits  gandharvas  rakshasas  and others  who will set their minds on attaining anuttarasamyaksambodhi and will delight in the great law if they are unable to hear sutras such as this  they will lose the opportunity to gain excellent benefits . but if beings such as these hear these sutras  they will surely believe and delight greatly in them and set their minds on a rare achievement . therefore you must respectfully accept these and  considering how living beings can best gain benefits from them  expound them far and wide .  maitreya  you should understand that there are two types of bodhisattvas . what are these two types  the first type loves varied phrases and literary embellishment . the second is not afraid of deeper principles and is able to enter into the true meaning . if there are those who love varied phrases and literary embellishments  you mã¡y be sure that they are beginners in the bodhisattva way . but if there are those who  approaching these extremely profound sutras  with their teachings on nondefilement and nonattachment  are not timid or fearful but can enter into the meaning and  having heard the sutras  with pure minds will accept  uphold  read  and recite them and practice them as the law directs  you may be sure that they have been practicing the way for a long time .  again  maitreya  there are two attitudes among those called beginners that prevent them from getting a firm grasp on these extremely profound teachings . what are these two  first is that of persons who  when they hear some profound sutra they have not heard before  are alarmed and timorous and  giving way to doubt  can not bring themselves to comply with it . in their disbelief they speak slanderously of it  saying  i have never heard this before  where does it come from   second is that of persons who  though there are those who guard  uphold  understand  and expound profound sutras of this type  are unwilling to associate closely with them  to offer them alms or treat them with respect  but at times may even speak of their faults before others . where you find these two attitudes  you may be sure the persons are beginners in the bodhisattva way . they do injury to themselves and can not train their minds to accept the profound teachings .  again  maitreya  there are two attitudes among the bodhisattvas who  though they believe and understand the profound teachings  yet do injury to themselves and are unable to accept the truth of birthlessness . what are these two  first is that of persons who are contemptuous of beginner bodhisattvas and will not teach or enlighten them . second is that of persons who  though they understand the profound teachings  seize upon surface appearances and make distinctions . these are the two attitudes .  the bodhisattva maitreya  after listening to these words of exposition  addressed the buddha  saying   worldhonored one  this is something i have never heard before . it is as the buddha has said . i must remove myself far off from evils such as these and strive to uphold this law of anuttarasamyaksambodhi that the thus come one has gathered over numberless asamkhya kalpas . if in the ages to come there are good men and good women who seek the great vehicle  i will see to it that sutras such as this come into their hands  will lend them powers of memorization  and will cause them to accept  uphold  read  and recite the sutras and expound them far and wide for others . worldhonored one  if in that latter age there are those who can accept  uphold  read  and recite them and expound them for others  you should know that all of them do so because i have inspired and strengthened them with my supernatural powers .  the buddha said   excellent  excellent  maitreya  it is as you have said . and the buddha will assist you in your joyful task   with this all the bodhisattvas  pressing their palms together  said to the buddha   after the thus come one has passed into extinction  we too will spread the law of anuttarasamyaksambodhi far and wide throughout the lands in the ten directions and will guide and assist those who expound the law  seeing to it that they acquire this sutra .  then the four heavenly kings said to the buddha   worldhonored one  in the towns and villages  the mountain forests and the broad plain  wherever there are those who possess this sutra  read and recite it  understand and expound it  we will take our ranks of officials and underlings and go to where they are so that we may hear the law and will shelter and protect them  making certain that no one approaches within a hundred yojanas of them on any side to try to take unfair advantage of them  then the buddha said to ananda   you must accept and uphold this sutra and propagate it far and wide .  ananda replied   indeed i will  i have already accepted and upheld its essentials  worldhonored one . but by what name should this sutra be called   the buddha said   ananda  this sutra should be called the expositions of vimalakirti . and another name for it is the doctrine of the emancipation beyond comprehension . this is how you should accept and uphold it .  when the buddha had finished expounding this sutra  the rich man vimalakirti  manjushri  shariputra  ananda  and the others  along with the heavenly and human beings  asuras  and all the other members of the great assembly were filled with joy at hearing the preaching of the buddha   and they believed and accepted it and respectfully put it into practice .  1 the concluding passage in brackets is

gods with there own beliefs and they knew what is there world about and what is truth about them that they are genies who needs believe from anyone who lives in reality of universe like humans and animals and birds and fishes and everyone who understands or thinks and remembers memory so these gods can get believe by believing in these humans and animals and birds and fishes ... etc so they believe in them to be true and when these humans and animals and birds and fishes ... etc becomes true they get believe and continue to live in there worlds which they call it as worlds of god . these devils not all but most of them controlled humans and animals and birds and fishes from there understanding after having believe so humans and animals and birds and fishes ... etc are in control of them . these devils were not real as they could not show themselves to everyone in reality and even if they showed themselves to everyone in reality they could not proof that they are religions gods . because they only could show themselves when they become true by anyone from reality of humans like humans and animals and birds and fishes ... etc these devils name were allah and hindu god and christian god and etc which were known by purity to humans but from there world they did everything to control humans and animals and birds and fishes ... etc so they dont loose from them and not die and there was no such thing as sin for them because they believe was who is true they rules and who is true there power works . devils learned what is truth from last of torah and came to know from last of torah that they act on memories of humans and animals and birds and fishes ... etc and they can die from any memory of truth from humans and animals and birds and fishes ... the devils pain was very difficult to show here because it was felt by most of the believers of devils in there worlds from sky and humans and animals and birds and fishes ... etc have to just remember the memory so these devils comes in conrtol of humans and animals and birds and fishes ... etc or anyone who is of purity like last of torah . devils were worried what is happening to world as they use to control humans and animals and birds and fishes ... etc from there understanding and they could not control themselves when last of torah born on planet earth and since the beginning of last of torah they kept genies inside last of torah head to put him in prison so his understanding doesnt works properly and he have brain disorders and when brain have disorders his understanding does nt works properly on anything so devils dont die by loosing from last of torah . finally jewish hashem light of god visited and met last of torah and devils didnt left hashem light of god too to kill him and fool him through memory after learning knowledge from last of torah who didnt saw genies from there devils worlds and they tried to win from hashem light of god believers by doing everything by breaking every law and using every kind of knowledge and tricks and everything to save themselves but they could not survive and these devils truth was known to everyone in there worlds and it was the feeling of world war only in worlds where religions gods who are devils in originality happened . because last of torah was also one god of time and he knew those who are bad in the worlds of god will die when war happens and he didnt wanted to bring world war in reality of humans and animals and birds and fishes ... etc because it was not mistake of humans and animals and birds and fishes ... etc it was the war declared by last of torah so these devils dies and there genies gets finished from whom they control humans and animals and birds and fishes ... etc and do everything to win from humans and animals and birds and fishes ... etc and continue living . you only imagine those who needs believe from humans and animals and birds and fishes ... etc to continue living do they have right to terminate humans and animals and birds and fishes ... etc life  the answer from last of torah is no . the world war in worlds of god with most of them devils continued and angels just needed to pray for the devils to be finished which angels did nt do because they didnt hear command from last of torah . last of torah knew if worlds of god is destroyed after world war happens and some devils who are known as religions gods dies then automatically from believe of last of torah the worlds of god where devils lives will become good again and that happened many times and these religions gods devils came to know truth that when last of torah is happy automatically the worlds of gods are made as what they use to see what dream inside universe which was not seen to humans and animals and birds and fishes ... etc last of torah knew only original will live and those who are original devils like allah and hindu god and christian god has to die by forcely killing them in world war so they understand there originality and reality that how much fake they are and how easily they can be controlled by anyone who knows they can be controlled by humans and animals and birds and fishes ... etc memories . 2  25 â€¢ divine unity and you can never do  it  â€ ” then be on your guard against the fire whose fuel is people and stones   it is prepared for the disbelievers . 25 and give good news to those who believe and do good deeds  that for them are gardens in which rivers flow . whenever they are given a portion of the fruit of these  gardens   they will say  this is what was given to us before  and they are given the like of it . c and they will have therein pure companions and therein they will abide . 26 surely allah does not disdain to set forth any parable â€ ” a gnat or anything above that . 6 then as for those who believe  they know that it is the truth from their lord  and as for those who disbelieve  they say  what is it that allah means by this parable  a  24  the reference in  stones  may be to the leaders  called  helpers  in the previous verse  while  people  would stand for the common people . b  251  the description of paradise as given in the holy quran is expressly stated to be a parable  see 1335  4715 . the righteous are spoken of as having gardens in the next life to show that they have made the seed of faith to grow into extensive gardens  and this is in reference to the vast development of their inner self or of the faculties which god has given them . the rivers represent the good deeds which are necessary to the growth of the seed . the fruits of the life after death are the consequences of the deeds done in this life . c  252  whenever the faithful are made to taste of a portion of the fruits of their good deeds in the life to come  they will find those fruits much resembling the fruits which they tasted spiritually in this life . the like of it may signify that the fruits of their deeds will be similar to those deeds . d  253  the pure companions may be the believing wives of the faithful  as elsewhere we have   they and their wives are in shades  reclining on raised couches   3656  . but more probably these are among the blessings of the heavenly life to which men and women are equally entitled . all the blessings of heavenly life are  according to a saying of the holy prophet   things which no eye has seen and no ear has heard  nor has it entered into the heart of man to con ceive of them   bukhari  598  . the words in which these blessings are depicted in the holy quran  therefore  should not be taken literally . e  261  the parables to which reference is contained in these words are the parables speaking of the weakness of the false deities  see 2941  2273 . the gnat is mentioned here because among the arabs it is a proverbially weak creature  so that to express the utmost degree of weakness they say  weaker than the gnat . 2 . the cow â€¢ 2  27 many he leaves in error by it  and many he leads aright by it . and he leaves in error by it only the transgressors  27 who break the covenant of allah after its confirmation and cut apart what allah has ordered to be joined  and make mischief in the land . these it is that are the losers . 28 how can you deny allah and you were without life and he gave you life  again  he will cause you to die and again bring you to life  then you shall be brought back to him . c 29 he it is who created for you all that is in the earth . and he directed him self to the heaven so he made them complete seven heavens  6 and he is knower of all things . section 4  greatness of mankind and need for revelation 30 and when your lord said to the angels  i am going to place a ruler in the earth  g they said  will you place in it such as a  262  allah guides people by sending his messengers  and therefore he could not be spoken of as leading them astray . when ascribed to god  the word adalla used here means he pronounced him to be erring or he left him in error . b  27  the covenant of allah is the evidence of his unity to which human nature bears witness . the confirmation of this covenant is brought about by send ing prophets . cutting off what allah has ordered to be joined is the disregard of others  rights . c  28  the first part of the verse contains an argument of the existence of god who gave life to man  and the second states that death on this earth is not the end of life but the beginning of another  an eternal and a far higher life . d  291  the earth was made after the heavens  see 7930. e  292  the word sab a  which signifies the number seven  is also used as meaning seven or more  several or many . in 6512 it is affirmed that as there are seven heavens so there is a like number of earths  and the seven heavens are called the seven ways in 2317  and in this sense the orbit of a planet may be called its heaven . the seven heavens may also be taken to apply to the whole starry creation and the reference may in this case be to the magnitudes of the stars .   301  allah s saying to the angels is really the expression of an intention which is to be brought into execution . it is not a conversation  or a consultation with the angels  it is an expression of the divine will to those intermediary beings who are entrusted by the divine being with its execution . the existence of such intermediaries has been recognized by the righteous in all ages and all countries . g  302  this shows the high place that man was destined to hold in the whole 231  need for revelation 9 make mischief in it and shed blood  and we celebrate your praise and extol your holiness . he said  surely i know what you do not know .  31 and he taught adam all the names then presented them to the angels  he said  tell me the names of those if you are right . 32 they said  glory be to you  we have no knowledge but what you have taught us . surely you are the knowing  the wise . 33 he said  o adam  inform them of their names . so when he informed them of their names  he said  did i not say to you that i know what is unseen in the heavens and the earth  and i know what you manifest and what you hide 34 and when we said to the angels  be submissive to adam  they submitted  2 but not iblts . he refused and was proud  and he of creation . what is stated here is an allegorical description of the preference of man above the whole of the creation on this earth  and then of the election of those righteous servants of allah from among men themselves who lead others into the right path . one view is that the word  ruler   khalifa  here refers to the whole of mankind  which is corroborated by the quran itself in 6165. a  303  being entrusted with such great powers  man could use them rightly or wrongly . the whole history of mankind is briefly written in this one verse . man is the greatest killer on this earth but he also turns the gifts of god to the best use . to god was known the brighter side of this picture  hence the words   know what you do not know . b  311  nowhere in the holy quran is it affirmed that adam was the first man or that there was no creation before him . great muslim theologians have held that there were many adams â€ ” thousands of adams â€ ” before the great ancestor of mankind known by this name . adam  therefore  though it may also be the name of a particular man  stands for mankind generally . c  312  teaching adam the names signifies the vast capability of man and the superiority of his knowledge to that of the angels . or  the reference may be to the faculty of speech  which is the real source of the excellence of man above the whole of creation . d  33   what you hide  refers to those great qualities in man which pre ponderate the evil in him  and which remain hidden until they are made manifest through the divine gift of knowledge . the immense capability of man for pro gress remains hidden  while the evil of shedding blood is manifested in a very primary stage in his growth . e  341  adam throughout this section stands for man generally  so sub mission is to man generally . man has a superiority over the angels on account of his great gift of knowledge of things  the angels being the controlling powers of 10 2 . the cow â€¢ 2  35 was one of the disbelievers .  35 and we said  o adam  dwell you and your wife in the garden  and eat from it a plentiful  food  wherever you wish  and do not approach this tree or you would be from among the unjust . e 36 but the devil made them slip from it  and caused them to depart from the state in which they were . and we said  go forth  some of you are enemies of others . 8 and there is for you in the earth an abode and a provision for a time . the forces of nature . by his knowledge man could harness the forces of nature and exercise control over them  in other words  the angels submitted to him . a  342  iblls and satan  arabic  shaitan  refer to one and the same being . the word iblis is used when the evil one s evil is limited to himself  and satan  when his evil affects others besides himself . the angels  submission meant that man could control the forces of nature by his knowledge of things . but he himself was a part of nature  and he could not conquer his own evil desires . the conquest of self needed yet another act of divine mercy  the sending of divine revelation . note that iblls was not one of the angels . b  351  the garden spoken of in this verse was on this earth  as it was on the earth that man was placed . it was certainly not the paradise to which people go after death  and from which they will never be expelled  1548  . the placing in the garden signifies leading a life of ease and comfort  as is shown by the words that follow   eat from it a plentiful food wherever you wish  . these may also be translated as  eat from it wherever you wish  having abundance of all things . c  352  it was the tree of the spiritual death of man  the tree of evil . compare 142426  where a good word is likened to  a good tree  whose root is firm and whose branches are high  yielding its fruit in every season   and an evil word is likened to  an evil tree pulled up from the earth s surface  it has no stability  . the order to eat from the earth a plentiful food but not to approach evil is really a des cription of what pure human nature is . man is entitled to all the benefits of nature to maintain the body so long as he does not forget his soul . rf  36l  the words mean that the devil made them commit a fault uninten tionally . the result was that they were made to depart from the happy condition in which they were . the quran contradicts the bible  it was not the serpent that misled eve  nor did eve mislead adam . the devil cast an evil suggestion into the minds of both adam and eve  as he casts evil suggestions into the mind of every son and daughter of adam and eve . e  362  the new condition in which man finds himself by submitting to his low desires is the condition of the mutual enmity of one to the other  the tyranny of man to man being undoubtedly the greatest evil which man can commit . the use of the words  some of you are enemies of others  shows clearly that this address is to all mankind . 237  israelite prophecies fulfilled 1 1 37 then adam received  revealed  words from his lord  and he turned to him  mercifully  . surely he is oftreturning  to mercy   the merciful .  38 we said  go forth from this  state  all . surely a guidance from me will come to you  then whoever follows my guidance  no fear shall come upon them  nor shall they grieve . 6 39 and  as to  those who disbelieve in and reject our messages  they are the companions of the fire  in it they will abide .  section 5  israelite prophecies fulfilled in the quran 40 o children of israel  call to mind my favour which i bestowed on you and be faithful to  your  covenant with me  i shall fulfil  my  covenant with you  and me  me alone  should you fear . 41 and believe in what i have revealed  verifying what a  37  man is found too weak to overcome the evil suggestions of the devil or the evil inclinations in him  however strong he may be to conquer the forces of nature . so god comes to his help and reveals himself to him . he sends down revelation which  strengthening his faith in god  gives him the strength to over come the devil and reject his suggestions . b  38  this is a statement of a general law that divine revelation will be granted to the whole of humanity and prophets will appear everywhere from time to time  and by following the guidance sent by god through his prophets people will attain to a state of perfection in which  no fear shall come upon them  nor shall they grieve  . those who truly follow the divine revelation shall have no fear of the devil misleading them  nor shall they grieve at wasting the opportunity given them in this life . c  39  the people spoken of in this verse are those who not only disbelieve but also exert their utmost to oppose revealed truth and uproot it . they keep company with evil in this life  so the fire becomes their companion in the next to purge them of the evil consequences of their evil deeds . their hearts burn with evil passions in this life  and it is this very fire that assumes a palpable shape in the next . note that the word khalidun   abide   signifies simply abiding  which may be for a long time  and does not necessarily convey the idea of perpetuity . d  40  after speaking of the need of divine revelation  the quran now speaks of a nation to whom this favour was granted  among whom many prophets were raised and who were also made rulers in the earth  see 520  . the jewish people who are addressed here are generally mentioned as children of israel  israel being the other name of jacob  son of isaac  son of abraham . for the covenants spoken of here  see deuteronomy 261719 . the covenant included the acceptance of the revelation to the promised prophet of deut . 1818 . 12 2 . the cow â€¢ 2  42 is  already  with you  and do not be the first to deny it  nor take a small price for my messages   and keep your duty to me  me alone . 42 and do not mix up truth with falsehood  nor hide the truth while you know . 43 and keep up prayer and give the due charity and bow down with those who bow down . 44 do you tell people to be good and neglect your own souls while you read the book  have you then no sense  45 and seek assistance through patience and prayer  and this is hard except for the humble ones  46 who know that they will meet their lord and that to him they will return . section 6  divine favours on israel 47 o children of israel  call to mind my favour which i bestowed on you and that i made you excel the nations 48 and guard yourselves against a day when no soul will avail another in the least  neither will intercession be accepted on its behalf  nor will compensation be taken from it  nor will they be helped . 49 and when we delivered you from pharaoh s people  who subjected you to severe torment  killing your sons and sparing a  41  the verification referred to here is clearly the fulfilment of the pro mise contained in deuteronomy 181518   the lord your god will raise up for you a prophet like me from your midst  from your brethren . him you shall hear . . .  . no prophet ever claimed to have come in fulfilment of this prophecy except the holy prophet muhammad . the religious leaders rejected the truth which the holy prophet brought  fearing to lose their high position as leaders . they thus sacrificed truth to the inducements of this life  and took  a small price  for it . b  43  these are the two fundamental principles of religion  worship of god through prayer to him  and service of humanity or helping the poor . c  47  by  the nations  are meant the people contemporaneous with the israelites in their days of triumph  or large masses of people . numerous prophets were raised among them  and they were made to rule in the earth  and these are the favours of which moses also reminds them  520  . d  48  the islamic doctrine that the prophets and the righteous will intercede for sinners on the day of judgment really means that if they took as their model a righteous servant of god and did their best to follow him  this will shelter them from their own weaknesses . see further 2255 footnote 1 and 485 footnote . 2  50 â€¢ divine favours on israel 13 your women  and in this there was a great trial from your lord . 50 and when we parted the sea for you  so we saved you and drowned the people of pharaoh while you saw .  51 and when we appointed a time of forty nights with moses  then you took the calf  for a god  after him  and you were unjust . 4 52 then we pardoned you after that so that you might give thanks . 53 and when we gave moses the book and the criterion that you might walk aright . 54 and when moses said to his people  my people  you have surely wronged yourselves by taking the calf  for a god   so turn to your creator  penitently   and kill your passions .  that is best for you with your creator . so he turned to you  mercifully  . surely he is the oftreturning  to mercy   the merciful . 55 and when you said  moses  we will not believe in you till we see allah manifestly  so the punishment overtook you while you looked on . e 56 then we raised you up after your stupor that you might give thanks . 57 and we made the clouds to give shade a  50  the quran does not say how the israelites were made to pass through the sea or in what manner the parting of the sea was brought about . one expla nation is that the israelites passed when the sea receded on account of the ebb  and the egyptians were drowned because the tide was on at the time  and in their zeal to overtake the israelites they did not care for it . b  51  while the making of the calf is attributed to aaron in the bible  the holy quran declares that prophet to be innocent in the matter . c  53  furqdn  criterion   distinction   is anything that makes a distinction between truth and falsity  and hence it signifies a proof or demonstration and also aid or victory . in the sense of distinction  the furqdn given to moses was pharaoh s drowning in the sea and the deliverance of the israelites . in the case of the holy prophet the battle of badr afforded the furqdn or distinction  and hence the battle of badr is called yaum alfurqdn or the day of distinction in 841. d  54  the holy quran rejects the bible story of the israelites being killed as a punishment for calfworship . they were pardoned and were told simply to repent  and god accepted their repentance as clearly stated here . therefore anfusakum does not mean here your people  but your desires or your passions . no prophet ever taught that a man can be killed for the worship of an object other than god . e  55  see exodus 191617 . 14 2 . the cow â « 258 over you and we sent to you manna and quails . eat of the good things that we have given you . and they did us no harm  but they wronged their own souls . 58 and when we said  enter this city  then eat from it a plentiful  food  wherever you wish  and enter the gate submissively  and make petition for forgiveness . we will forgive you your wrongs and increase the reward of those who do good  to others  . 59 but those who were unjust changed the word which had been spoken to them  for another saying   so we sent upon the wrong doers a pestilence from heaven because they transgressed . section 7  divine favours on israel 60 and when moses prayed for water for his people  we said  march on to the rock with your staff . e so twelve springs flowed from it . each tribe knew their drinkingplace . eat and drink of the provisions of allah  and do not act corruptly  making mischief in the land . 61 and when you said  moses  we can not endure one food  so pray your lord on our behalf to bring forth for us out of what the earth grows  of its herbs and its cucumbers and its garlic and its lentils and its onions . he said  would you exchange what a  591  that is to say  they went against the divine commandment . b  592  when a punishment overtakes a people as a consequence of their wicked deeds it is spoken of as coming from heaven  the significance probably being that it can not be averted . the pestilence spoken of here is referred to in the bible in numbers 2589  according to which 24000 men died of the plague . c  60  the words may mean strike the rock with your staff or march on to the mountain with your staff ox your community . the story that moses carried a stone with him and that twelve springs flowed from it whenever  placing it in the wilderness  he struck it with his staff  has no foundation in the words of the holy quran or any saying of the holy prophet . what the words of the quran signify is either that moses was commanded by god to strike a particular rock with his staff from which water flowed forth miraculously  or to march on to a mountain from which springs flowed . d  611  the israelites were required to live a hard life which would make them fit for conquering the holy land  this was better for them . but they wanted to live a life of ease and to have all kinds of food which they could get only by settling in towns and tilling the land . 2  62 â€¢ israelites  degeneration 15 is better for what is worse  enter a city  so you will have what you ask for . and degradation and humiliation were stamped upon them  and they incurred allah s wrath .  that was so because they dis believed in the messages of allah and would kill the prophets unjustly . that was so because they disobeyed and exceeded the limits . section 8  israelites  degeneration 62 surely those who believe  and those who are jews  and the christians  and the sabians  6 whoever believes in allah and the last day and does good  they have their reward with their lord  and there is no fear for them  nor shall they grieve . c 63 and when we made a covenant with you and raised the mountain above you  hold on firmly what we have given you  and bear in mind what is in it  so that you may guard against evil . 64 then after that you turned back  and if it had not been for the grace of allah and his mercy on you  you would certainly have a  612  the verse speaks of the ultimate condition to which the israelites were reduced when they persisted in setting at naught the divine commandments and indulged in immoral and depraved practices . b  621  the commentators hold different opinions regarding sabians  most of them agreeing that they are representatives of a religion between judaism and christianity  based on the doctrine of unity  but also maintaining worship of angels . c  622  this verse strikes at the root of the idea of a favoured nation whose members alone may be entitled to salvation . the subject is introduced here to show that even the jews  despite their transgressions which had made them deser ving of divine wrath  were entitled to a goodly reward if they believed and did good deeds . the statement made here is that salvation can not be attained by mere lipprofession by any people  not even by the muslims  unless they adhere to a true belief and do good deeds . the existence of good people in other religions is not denied by the holy quran  but perfect peace  or the state of absolute content ment which is indicated by freedom from fear and grief  is obtainable only in islam  because it alone is the religion of absolute submission to the divine being . d  63  there is nothing in the words of the quran to support the baseless story that the mountain was suspended in the air over the heads of the israelites to frighten them into submission . the use of the word raf   raised   is in accord ance with the arabic idiom  for it signifies the making high or lofty of a building . 16 2 . the cow â « 265 been among the losers . 65 and indeed you know those among you who violated the sabbath   so we said to them  be  as  apes  despised and hated . 66 so we made them an example to those who wit nessed it and those who came after it and an admonition to those who guard against evil . 67 and when moses said to his people  allah commands you to sacrifice a cow . c they said  do you ridicule us  he said  i seek refuge with allah from being one of the ignorant . 68 they said  call on jour lord for our sake to make it plain to us what she is .  moses  said  he says  surely she is a cow neither advanced in age nor too young  of middle age between these  two   so do what you are commanded . 69 they said  call on your lord for our sake to make it clear to us what her colour is .  moses  said  he says  she is a yellow cow  her colour is intensely yellow delighting the onlookers . 70 they said  call on your lord for our sake to make it clear to us what she is  for surely to us cows are all alike  and if allah please we shall surely be guided aright . 71  moses  said  he says  she is a cow not made submissive to plough the land  nor does she water the crops  sound  without a blemish in her . they said  now you have brought the truth . so they slaughtered her  though they were not inclined to do  it  . a  651  there is no sabbath among the muslims because in islam no particular day is set apart for divine worship . on the other hand  the muslim is required to pray in the very midst of his everyday work  and even the jumu ah  friday  prayers are no exception  for the quran expressly allows the doing of work both before and after the jumu ah prayers . b  652  an early commentator  mujahid  gives the following explanation   they were not transformed or metamorphosed  it is only a parable which allah has set forth for them  the like of what he has set forth in likening them to asses  625   i.e.  their hearts were transformed  not that they were metamorphosed into apes .  c  67  as the israelites held the cow in great honour  and even worshipped it  as is clear from their worship of the golden calf  they were ordered to slaughter such cows as were usually let loose to wander and worshipped as sacred objects  the aim being to root out cowworship from among them . 2  72 â€¢ they grow in hardheartedness 17 section 9  they grow in hardheartedness 72 and when you  almost  killed a man   then you disagreed about it . and allah was to bring forth what you were going to hide . 73 so we said  strike him with it partially . thus allah brings the dead to life  c and he shows you his signs that you may under stand . 74 then your hearts hardened after that  so that they were like rocks  rather worse in hardness . and surely there are some rocks from which streams burst forth  and there are some of them which split apart so water flows from them  and there are some of them which fall down for the fear of allah . and allah is not heedless of what you do . 75 do you then hope that they would believe in you  and some of them indeed used to hear the word of allah  then altered it after they had understood it  and they know  this  . 6 76 and when they meet those who believe they say  we believe  and when they are apart with one another they say  do you talk to them of what allah has disclosed to you that they may contend with you by this before your lord  do you not understand  77 do they not know a  721  this incident refers to jesus  as it was with respect to his death that disagreement took place and many doubted his death . compare the incidents narrated here with the same incidents as narrated in 4153157 . the words you killed are used because the jews asserted that they had killed him  and because metaphorically a person may be said to have been killed when he is made to appear as if he were dead . b  722  the jews wanted to kill jesus  but god ordained that he should not die . this was the bringing forth of what they were going to hide . c  73  the act of murder was not completed in the case of jesus  as the gospels show  for after he was taken down from the cross his legs were not broken  as in the case of the thieves . this was really a case of giving life to the dead  for jesus christ was dead to all appearance . those actually dead do not return to life in this world  see 2195  23100 and 3942. rf  74  even hardened hearts would receive life â€ ” even more  they would give life to others  be a source of spiritual life for others as water and streams are sources of life in the physical world . e  75  that the israelites did not preserve their sacred books in their purity is a constant charge laid by the holy quran against the jews . in fact  the alteration and corruption of the various books of the bible is now proved beyond all doubt . 18 2 . the cow â « 278 that allah knows what they keep secret and what they make known  78 and some of them are illiterate  they do not know the book except  from  hearsay  and they only conjecture . 79 woe  then  to those who write the book with their hands then say  this is from allah  so that they may take for it a small price . so woe to them for what their hands write and woe to them for what they earn . 80 and they say  fire will not touch us but for a few days . say  have you received a promise from allah  then allah will not fail to perform his promise . or do you speak against allah what you do not know  81 indeed  whoever earns evil and his sins beset him on every side  those are the companions of the fire  in it they abide .  82 and those who believe and do good deeds  these are the owners of the garden  in it they abide . e a  78  the jewish masses had no access to their own sacred books which were known only to their learned men  and therefore their religious ideas were based only on stories which they knew from hearsay . the same is to a very large extent true of the muslims of our day . in the early days of islam  every individual muslim  man as well as woman  sought light direct from the quran . not so the muslims in this age who depend entirely on their learned men . they do read the quran but look upon mere recitation as a meritorious deed without trying to learn what it says  and then act upon it . b  81  the inmates of the fire are here stated to be those who earn evil  and find themselves beset on every side by their evil deeds . these are the people who give themselves up to evil  and who therefore ultimately find themselves in the power of evil  which even in this life  but more palpably in the life after death  assumes the form of a burning fire . it should be noted that the one who struggles against evil  however long that struggle may take  to overcome an evil inclination  is not the one who earns evil  because the earnest struggle in which the fighter against evil hates and detests evil  and seeks to overcome it  always ends in a vic tory for the good and noble qualities in human beings . c  82  the doers of good are called ashab aljannah or owners of the garden . the word ashab is plural of sahib which means a companion or an owner . i have translated ashab annar as companions of the fire but ashab al jannah as owners of the garden  because while the inmates of the fire will be taken out of it after being purged of the evil  of paradise it is said that it is  a gift never to be cut off   11108   and that those in it will never be ejected from it  1548  . 283  their covenant and its violation 1 9 section 10  their covenant and its violation 83 and when we made a covenant with the children of israel   you shall serve none but allah . and do good to  your  parents  and to the near of kin and to orphans and the needy  and speak good  words  to  all  people   and keep up prayer and give the due charity . c then you turned back except a few of you  and you are averse . 84 and when we made a covenant with you  you shall not shed your blood  nor turn your people out of your cities  then you promised and you bear witness . 85 yet you it is who would kill your people and turn some of you out of their homes  backing each other up against them unlawfully and exceeding the limits . and if they should come to you as captives you would ransom them  whereas their turning out itself was unlawful for you . do you then believe in a part of the book and disbelieve in the other  e what then is the reward of such among you as do this but a  831  allah s making a covenant with a people signifies his giving commandments to them . b  832  the word qaul  speaking  is used to express all kinds of deeds  and hence the speaking of good words to all stands for kind dealing with all . c  833  prayer and zakat   due charity   as enjoined on the israelites differed from the islamic prayer and zakat in details . the directions regarding tithe among the israelites are contained in deuteronomy 142829. d  84  the previous verse speaks of a covenant with the children of israel while this one speaks of a covenant with you . the reference here is to the impor tant treaty of mutual obligation in writing which the holy prophet entered into with the jews when he settled at madinah . by this treaty the muslims and the jews were bound not only not to turn their hands against each other but also to defend one another against a common enemy . e  85  the reference is to the terms of the original treaty under which the jews were bound to ransom the muslims if they were made captives by an enemy . they did not openly repudiate the treaty but intrigued with the enemy to turn the muslims out of madinah . the reference in believing in a part of the book and disbelieving in the other is to this conduct of the jews . most commentators  however  understand that the reference here is to the alliance which the two jewish tribes  quraizah and nadir  living side by side at madinah  had made with aus and khazraj  the two rival tribes of madinah respectively . when the latter fought against each other  their allies took part in the fighting  and thus one jewish tribe slaughtered and imprisoned the other and laid waste their habitations  20 2 . the cow â€¢ 2  86 disgrace in the life of this world  and on the day of resurrection they shall be sent back to the most grievous punishment . and allah is not heedless of what you do . 86 these are they who buy the life of this world for the hereafter  so their punishment shall not be lightened  nor shall they be helped . section 1 1  they reject the prophet 87 and we indeed gave moses the book and we sent messengers after him one after another  and we gave jesus  son of mary  clear arguments and strengthened him with the holy spirit .  is it then that whenever a messenger came to you with what your souls did not desire  you were arrogant  and some you rejected and others you would kill . 88 and they say  our hearts are securely covered . no  allah has cursed them on account of their unbelief  c so it is little that they believe . 89 and when a book from allah came to them verifying what they  already  have  and before this they used to pray for victory against those who disbelieved â€ ” but afterwards collected subscriptions for the release of the jewish prisoners  on the ground that the law commanded them to redeem the prisoners and they fought against their coreligionists for the honour of their allies . a  87  generally the epithet  son of mary  is added to jesus  name to show that he was a mortal like other prophets of god . the long chain of prophets that came after moses ended in jesus  moses being the first and jesus the last prophet of the israelite dispensation . the idea of the holy ghost as met with in christian religious literature is quite different from and opposed to the jewish conception of the holy spirit which islam accepts . the holy spirit is the angel which brought revelation   the holy spirit has revealed it  i.e . the quran  from your lord   16102  . jesus  being strengthened with the holy spirit only means that he was granted divine revelation like other prophets before him . b  881  the meaning is either that they said that their hearts were so full of knowledge already that they stood in no need of any further knowledge  or that their hearts were covered from hearing and accepting what the prophet said . c  882  the allegation of the israelites was that  being descendants of pro phets  their hearts were the repositories of knowledge  and being already  as it were  full of knowledge  they did not stand in need of more . they are told that it was really their disbelief which became the cause of their estrangement from the good which the holy prophet had brought . d  89  the jews expected that when the prophet spoken of in deuteronomy 2  90 â€¢ they reject the prophet 21 but when that which they recognized came to them  they dis believed in it  so allah s curse is on the disbelievers . 90 evil is what they sell their souls for â€ ” that they should deny what allah has revealed  out of envy that allah should send down of his grace on whomsoever of his servants he pleases  so they incur wrath upon wrath . and there is a humiliating punishment for the disbelievers . 91 and when it is said to them  believe in what allah has revealed  they say  we believe in what was revealed to us . and they deny what is besides that  while it is the truth verifying what they  already  have .  say  why then did you kill allah s prophets before  this  if you were believers  92 and moses indeed came to you with clear arguments  then you took the calf  for a god  in his absence and you were wrongdoers . 93 and when we made a cove nant with you and raised the mountain above you  take hold of what we have given you with firmness and obey . they said  we hear and disobey . e and they were made to imbibe  the love of  the calf into their hearts on account of their disbelief . say  evil is what your faith bids you if you are believers . 94 say  if the abode of the hereafter with allah is specially for you to the exclusion of the  other  people  then invoke death if you are truthful . 95 and they will never invoke it on account of what their hands have already done  and allah knows the wrong doers . 96 and you will certainly find them the greediest of people for life   greedier  even than those who set up partners  with allah  . one of them loves to be granted a life of a thousand years  and his being granted a long life will in no way remove him 1818 came  he would make them victorious over their disbelieving opponents . a  911  they asserted that they could accept only a revelation granted to an israelite . the reply to this is that the revelation of the holy prophet is the truth verifying what is contained in their own scriptures . b  912  they tried to kill even israelite prophets  which shows that it was their hardheartedness which prevented them from accepting the truth  whether that truth was revealed through an israelite or a nonisraelite prophet . c  93  they did not utter these words with their tongues  but it is an expression of their condition . 22 2 . the cow â€¢ 2  97 further off from the punishment . and allah is seer of what they do . section 12  their enmity to the prophet 97 say  whoever is an enemy to gabriel a â€ ” for surely he revealed it to jour heart by allah s command  verifying what is  already  before it and a guidance and glad tidings for the believers . 98 whoever is an enemy to allah and his angels and his messengers and gabriel and michael  then surely allah is an enemy to disbelievers . 99 and we indeed have revealed to you clear messages  and none disbelieve in them except the transgressors . 100 is it that when ever they make a covenant  some of them cast it aside  no  most of them have no faith . 101 and when a messenger from allah came to them verifying what they  already  have  some of those who were given the book threw the book of allah behind their backs as if they knew nothing .  102 and they follow what the devils fabricated against the kingdom of solomon . and solomon did not disbelieve  but the devils disbelieved  teaching people enchantment . 6 and it was not a  97  the jews looked upon gabriel as their enemy because he was con sidered to be an avenging angel who brought down divine punishment upon the guilty . but in the bible  as in the holy quran  gabriel is mentioned as delivering divine messages to men  as in daniel 816 and in luke 119 and 26. b  98  man s enmity to allah signifies opposition to his commandments  and allah s enmity to man signifies the recompense for his opposition . note that allah is here said to be an enemy to those disbelievers only who first make them selves enemies to his prophets  and hence also to the divine being himself . c  101  the covenant referred to in v. 100 as being cast aside  and the throw ing of the book behind their backs  both refer to the israelites paying no heed to the prophecy of deuteronomy 1818  which was verified by the advent of the holy prophet . d  1021  according to an interpretation accepted by all commentators  by the devils here are meant human devils  or devils in the form of people . e  1022  the arabic word sihr   enchantment   signifies the producing of what is false in the form of truth   and embellishment by falsification and deceit  . 2  103 â€¢ previous scriptures are abrogated 23 revealed to the two angels in babel â€ ” harut and mariit . nor did they teach  it to  anyone  so that they should have said  we are only a trial  so do not disbelieve . but they learn from these two  sources  that by which they make a distinction between a man and his wife . and they can not hurt with it anyone except with allah s permission . and they learn that which harms them and does not benefit them . and certainly they know that he who buys it has no share of good in the hereafter . and surely evil is the price for which they have sold their souls  if only they knew  iâ° 3 and if they had believed and kept their duty  reward from allah would certainly have been better  if only they knew  section 13  previous scriptures are abrogated 104 o you who believe  do not say rd ina and say unzurna  and listen . and for the disbelievers there is a painful punishment .  105 neither those who disbelieve from among the people of the book  nor the idolaters  like that any good should be sent down to you from your lord . and allah chooses whom he pleases for his mercy  and allah is the lord of mighty grace . 106 whatever message we abrogate or cause to be forgotten  we bring one better than it or one like it . c do you not know that allah is powerful over a  1023  what the quran says here is that the jews  instead of following the word of god  followed certain evil crafts which they falsely attributed to solomon and to two angels at babel  harut and marat  . solomon is declared free of any such sinfulness attributed to him  and the story of the two angels is declared to be a fabrication . but the jews are blamed for learning from these two sources  i.e.  by their fabrications against solomon and the story of the two angels  things by which they made a distinction between a man and his wife . these words refer to secret gatherings of the nature of masonic societies  for it is in freemasonry and in no other religious society of the world that women are totally excluded . the words  they can not hurt with it anyone except with allah s permission  show that by this craft they intended to inflict some injury on the holy prophet . b  104  raina is equivalent to listen to us  but with a slight change of accent it becomes raina  which means he is foolish . the word unzurna  which means wait for us or grant us a little delay  is suggested instead  because it can not be distorted . morally the injunction is worthy of the highest regard  as it disappro ves of the use of words bearing a sinister meaning . c  106  the objection of the jews was  why was another revelation sent 24 2 . the cow â€¢ 2  107 all things  107 do you not know that allah s is the kingdom of the heavens and the earth  and that besides allah you have not any friend or helper  108 rather you wish to put questions to your messenger  as moses was questioned before . and whoever adopts disbelief instead of faith he indeed has lost the right direction of the way . 109 many of the people of the book wish that they could turn you back into disbelievers after you have believed  out of envy from themselves  after truth has become clear to them . but pardon and forgive  till allah bring about his command .  surely allah is powerful over all things . 110 and keep up prayer and give the due charity . and what ever good you send on ahead for yourselves  you will find it with allah . surely allah is seer of what you do . m and they say  none shall enter the garden except he who is a jew  or the christians .  these are their vain desires . say  bring your proof if you are truthful . 112 no  whoever submits himself entirely to allah and he is the doer of good  to others   he has his reward from his lord  and there is no fear for such nor shall they grieve . c down to muhammad  and why was a law containing new commandments promul gated  the answer is that if one law  i.e . the jewish law  was abrogated  one better than it was given through the holy prophet . the doctrine that some of the quranic verses were abrogated by others  though a generally accepted view  is due to a misconception of the words of this verse and is based simply on conjecture . there are no discrepancies in the quran  and it is want of reflection on it that is responsible for the theory of abrogation . a  109  note that muslims are told to pardon and forgive even such enemies . b  111  what is said here may be expanded thus  the jews say that none shall enter the garden except a jew and the christians say that none shall enter the garden except the christians . both degraded religion to a belief in a set of doctrines  and leading a life of righteousness was not considered as of the essence of religion . c  112  their assertions that only the jews and the christians will be saved are groundless . it is entire submission to god and the doing of good to his crea tures that is the true source of salvation  and that is what islam  means according to the holy quran . the name islam is derived from aslama  meaning submission  or entering into peace  . see also 319 footnote . 2113  perfect guidance is only in islam 25 section 14  perfect guidance is only in islam 113 and the jews say  the christians follow nothing  good   and the christians say  the jews follow nothing  good   while they recite the  same  book . even thus say those who have no knowledge  like what they say .  so allah will judge between them on the day of resurrection in that in which they differ . 114 and who is more unjust than he who prevents  people  from the mosques of allah  from his name being remembered in them  and strives to ruin them   as for  these  it was not proper for them to enter them except in fear . for them is disgrace in this world  and theirs is a grievous punishment in the hereafter . 115 and allah s is the east and the west  so whichever way you turn  there is allah s purposed surely allah is amplegiving  knowing . 116 and they say  allah has taken to himself a son â€ ” glory be to him  rather  whatever is in the heavens and the earth is his . all are obedient to him . 117 wonderful originator of the heavens a  113  the jews and the christians are here blamed for denying all good in each other like ignorant people  despite both being followers of one book  by which is here meant the old testament  which both accepted . as against this  the quran accepts that there is partial truth in all religions . b  114  the idolatrous quraish had turned the muslims out of the sacred mosque at makkah and the jews and the christians were now helping them to annihilate the small muslim community in madinah  which practically meant the laying waste of the sacred mosque itself . the word mosques is used here because the sacred mosque was to be the centre of all the mosques of the world . this generalization further shows that the fate of all those who prevented muslims from worshipping allah in mosques is predicted here  and the fate of the oppo nents of the holy prophet bears ample testimony to the truth of this prediction . c  115  these words point clearly to the divine promise that all obstacles in the path of the muslims will be removed and victory will follow their footsteps . rf  116  the phrase  glory be to him   subhanahu  is always used to dec lare the freedom of the divine being from all imperfections  and is always mentioned in connection with the christian doctrine that god has a son to show that to attribute a son to the divine being is to attribute an imperfection to him  which is met with in human beings . the doctrine of sonship is mentioned here as being opposed to the religion which requires entire submission to divine 26 2 . the cow 2118 and the earth  and when he decrees an affair  he only says to it  be  and it is .  118 and those who have no knowledge say  why does not allah speak to us or a sign come to us  even thus said those before them  like what they say . their hearts are all alike . indeed we have made the messages clear for a people who are sure . 119 surely we have sent you with the truth as a bearer of good news and as a warner  and you will not be called upon to answer for the companions of the flaming fire . 120 and the jews will not be pleased with you  nor the christians  unless you follow their religion . say  surely allah s guidance â€ ” that is the  perfect  guidance . and if you follow their desires after the knowledge that has come to you  you shall have from allah no friend  nor helper . 121 those to whom we have given the book follow it as it ought to be followed . e these believe in it . and whoever disbelieves in it  these it is that are the losers . section 15  covenant with abraham 122 o children of israel  call to mind my favour which i bestowed on you and that i made you excel the nations . 123 and be commandments from every person and thus dispenses with the necessity of a conciliator . a  117  this is the oftrecurring phrase in which allah s act of the creation and annihilation of things is spoken of in the holy quran . it is not meant by this that there is no gradual process in the creation of things . it is  in fact  an answer to those who think that the creation of things by god is dependent on the previous existence of matter and soul and the adaptability of their attributes . the argument given here in the word  originator   bad    is that man  who stands in need of matter to make things  also stands in need of a pattern after which to make them  but god stands in need of neither . b  118  the answer to both these demands is contained in v. 119  for as a bearer of good news the holy prophet told them that if they purified themselves by walking in his footsteps  allah would speak to them  and as a warner he informed them of the coming wrath  the sign which they often demanded  if they persisted in their evil ways . c  121  the muslims are meant  while the book is the quran . d  122  the israelites are three times told in the holy quran  see earlier 240 and 247  that god had made them a great nation but that it was by their own evil 2124  covenant with abraham 27 on your guard against a day when no soul will avail another in the least  neither will any compensation be accepted from it  nor will intercession benefit it  nor will they be helped . 124 and when his lord tried abraham with certain commands he fulfilled them . he said  surely i will make you a leader of people .  abraham  said  and of my offspring  my covenant does not include the wrongdoers  said he .  125 and when we made the house a resort for people and a  place of  security  and  saying   take the place of abraham for a place of prayer . c and we deeds and forsaking the ways of righteousness that they were proving themselves unworthy of that greatness . here they are being addressed the third time and reminded of the covenant which was made with abraham  the great patriarch in whom the israelites and the ishmaelites met . a  124  abraham was made spiritual leader of people because he was found perfect in fulfilling the divine commandments . as a spiritual leader of three great nations of the world  that patriarch occupies a unique position . having discussed at length that a prophet from the ishmaelites had come in accordance with the prophecies of the israelite prophets  the holy quran now proceeds to show that even the covenant with their great ancestor abraham necessitated the appearance of a prophet in arabia . the second part of the verse states that the spiritual leadership of the world was still with abraham s descendants . the covenant was made  not with israel but with abraham  and that therefore the seed of ishmael and isaac were equally to be blessed . in fact  as stated further on in 2125  the covenant was made with both abraham and ishmael . the jewish and christian contention that the covenant made with ishmael was simply of a temporal nature is groundless . b  1251  albait or the house is the famous house known by this name to this day  the kabah . it is also known as bait allah or the house of allah  and is the same as the bethel of the bible . history bears out these three distinguishing characteristics of the kabah . it exists from the remotest antiquity  it was visited annually by people from the most distant corners of arabia  and its sacredness was respected by the whole of arabia . c  1252  the kabah  the spiritual centre of islam  was connected with the name of abraham  and pointed reference to this is made in the mention of maqam ibrahim or the place of abraham . it is true that a particular place  a small building supported by six pillars about eight feet high  situated in the kabah  is known by this name  and is incontrovertible evidence of abraham s connection with arabia and its spiritual centre . but here really maqam ibrahim stands for the house itself . the injunction to take the place of abraham for a place of prayer means that the kabah shall be the central mosque of the muslims . it is called the place 28 2 . the cow â€¢ 2  126 commanded abraham and ishmael   saying  purify my house for those who visit  it  and those who abide  in it  for devotion and those who bow down  and  those who prostrate themselves . 126 and when abraham said  my lord  make this a secure town and provide its people with fruits  such of them as believe in allah and the last day . he said  and whoever disbelieves  i shall grant him enjoyment for a short while  then i shall drive him to the punishment of the fire . and it is an evil destination . 127 and when abraham and ishmael raised the foundations of the house  e our lord  accept from us  surely you are the hearing  the knowing . 128 0ur lord  and make us both submissive to you  and  raise  from our offspring  a nation submissive to you  and show us our ways of devotion and turn to us  merci fully   surely you are the oftreturning  to mercy   the merciful . 129 0ur lord  and raise up in them a messenger from among them who shall recite to them your messages and teach them the book of abraham because it was abraham who purified it of the idols and it was abraham who rebuilt the house as stated further on . a  1253  ishmael s connection with arabia is established by the bible itself  for kedar  son of ishmael  genesis 2513  stands throughout the writings of the old testament for arabia  psalms 1205  isaiah 4211 and 607  . the arab tradi tion representing abraham as coming with hagar and ishmael to the place where now makkah is  is quite independent of the bible statement  and the facts recor ded in the quran are borne out fully by arab tradition and the bible . b  126  abraham  when settling hagar and ishmael near the sacred house  which was already there  laid the foundations of the city of makkah there . while abraham prayed for provisions of life for the righteous only  god s acceptance of the prayer included the wicked of that city as well  see 2857  . c  127  abraham and ishmael rebuilt the kabah  which was already there  see 1437. d  128  the word translated as submissive is muslim in the original . a muslim is so called because he surrenders himself to the will of god or because he is secure from the slavery of the devil or because he enters into peace . though all prophets were muslims but only the followers of the prophet muhammad are known as a muslim nation . at the time when these verses were revealed  there existed only a few muslims in madinah  and reference to a muslim nation was still prophetical . 2130  the religion of abraham 29 and the wisdom  and purify them . surely you are the mighty  the wise .  section 16  the religion of abraham 130 and who forsakes the religion of abraham but he who makes a fool of himself . and certainly we made him pure in this world  and in the hereafter he is surely among the righteous . 131 when his lord said to him  submit  he said  i submit myself to the lord of the worlds . 132 and the same did abraham command his sons  and  so did  jacob  my sons  surely allah has chosen for you  this  religion  so do not die except as submitting ones . 133 0r were you witnesses when death visited jacob  when he said to his sons  what will you serve after me  they said  we shall serve your god and the god of your fathers  abraham and ishmael and isaac  one god only  and to him do we submit . 134 those are a people that have passed away  for them is what they earned and for you what you earn  and you will not be asked of what they did . 135 and they say  be jews or christians  you will be on the right course . say  rather   we follow  the religion of abraham  the upright one  6 and he was not of those who set up partners  with allah  . 136 say  we believe in allah and  in  what has been revealed to us  and  in  what was revealed to abraham  and ishmael and isaac and jacob and the tribes  and  in  what was given to moses and jesus  and  in  what was given to the prophets from their lord  we make no distinction between any of them and a  129  the messenger had appeared but the great task of teaching the book and the wisdom to the progeny of ishmael  the arabs  and the still greater task of purifying them of evil  had yet to be performed  and its mention at this time was therefore prophetical . the more one ponders on the unique transformation brought about by the holy prophet in arabia  and through arabia in the world  the more one s head bows before the grandeur of this prophecy . b  135  the word hanlf or  upright  is often mentioned in connection with the name of abraham and the holy prophet  and his followers are also enjoined to be hanlf muslims are enjoined to remain firm in the right state  and thus to be the true representatives of the abrahamic faith in the world . it is for this reason that the word hanlf is used here in opposition to the attitude of both the jews and the christians . 30 2 . the cow â€¢ 2  137 to him we submit .  137 so if they believe as you believe  they are indeed on the right course  and if they turn back  then they are only in opposition . but allah will be sufficient for you against them  and he is the hearing  the knowing . 138  we take  allah s colour  and who is better than allah at colouring  and we are his worshippers . 139 say  do you dispute with us about allah  and he is our lord and your lord  and for us are our deeds and for you your deeds  and we are sincere to him  140 or do you say that abraham and ishmael and isaac and jacob and the tribes were jews or christians  say  do you know better or allah  and who is more unjust than he who conceals a testimony that he has from allah  and allah is not heedless of what you do . 141 those are a people that have passed away  and for them is what they earned a  136  this shows the cosmopolitan nature of a muslim s belief . not only is belief in the great prophets of israel an article of faith with a muslim  but the words what was given to the prophets from their lord make the muslim concep tion of belief in prophets as wide as the world . and it should be noted that this broad conception was promulgated at a time when the jews and the christians were exerting themselves to the utmost against the new faith . b  138  the religion of islam is called allah s colour because god is upper most in a muslim s ideas  and because his views are as broad as humanity . this particular word has also been adopted here as a hint to christians that baptism of water does not effect any change in a person . it is the baptism of the broad prin ciple of faith  accepting the prophets of all nations  that brings about change in the mentality of man . it is through this baptism that the new birth is received  because it opens the mind for the reception of all truth  and inspires it with love and rev erence for all good people . c  139  a muslim s conception of allah is very broad . it includes all that is best in all other religions  but is free from the limitations they put . therefore no one who is true to his religion can dispute the muslim conception of the divine being . moreover  every religion of the world limits the spiritual sustenance of god to one nation or one country . not so islam  which says that the truth was revealed to every nation . every nation thus accepts partial truth  only that part of the truth which was revealed to it  but islam accepts the whole truth . d  140  the jewish claim was that only acceptance of the jewish law could save man  and the christians claimed that none could be saved unless he accepted the atonement of jesus . they are told that their ancestors who were prophets were the followers of neither the one nor the other . islam was  in fact  a reversion to the simple faith of sincerity  the faith of abraham and his immediate followers and descendants . 0 2  142 â€¢ the kabah as the spiritual centre 3 1 and for you what you earn  and you will not be asked concerning what they did . section 17  the kabah as the spiritual centre 142 the fools among the people will say  what has turned them from their qiblah which they had  say  the east and the west belong only to allah  he guides whom he pleases to the right path .  143 and thus we have made you an exalted nation that you may be the bearers of witness to the people and  that  the messenger may be a bearer of witness to you . e and we did not make that which you would have to be the qiblah but that we a  142  qiblah means the direction or point towards which one turns his face . in its religious usage it means the direction towards which a person turns his face when saying his prayers  and the qiblah is thus the spiritual centre of a people . the change here referred to is the change which took place at madinah about sixteen months after the prophet s flight to that city . while the holy prophet was at makkah among the idolaters  he used to pray with his face to the holy temple at jerusalem  but when he came to madinah  where the jewish ele ment was strong and powerful  he was directed by divine revelation to turn his face to the kabah as his qiblah . if abraham s seed was to be blessed in ishmael s progeny  it was necessary that the new spiritual centre should be the house puri fied by abraham and ishmael  the first house appointed for mankind  the temple at jerusalem being only the spiritual centre of the israelites . b  1431  the word wasat   exalted   signifies the middle part of anything  and therefore  as being removed from either extreme  it signifies the best part of a thing . the commentators explain wasat as meaning equitable and exalted . by making the kabah their qiblah  allah had made it known that they were the people  the muslim nation  for whom abraham had prayed  v. 128   and therefore they were the inheritors of all those divine blessings which had been promised to the seed of abraham . c  1432  the bearers of witness are the persons who carry knowledge to others  bearing testimony to its truth in their own persons . some commentators explain the word shahid   bearer of witness   as meaning a purifier . but it also means an imam or a leader  and the significance is that just as the prophet deli vered the message of truth to the muslims and was their purifier and leader  the role of the muslim community was to deliver the message of truth to the whole of humanity and to be its purifiers and leaders . d  1433  the words  that which you would have to be the qiblah  mean on which you had firmly set your heart that it should be your qiblah . it thus appears that the prophet longed that the kabah should be his qiblah  yet he did not take 32 2 . the cow â€¢ 2  144 might distinguish him who follows the messenger from him who turns back upon his heels . and it was indeed a hard test except for those whom allah has guided . nor was allah going to make your faith to be fruitless . surely allah is compassionate  merciful  to the people . 144 indeed we see the turning of jour face to heaven  so we shall surely make you master of the qiblah which you like  a turn then jour face towards the sacred mosque . and wherever you are  turn your faces towards it . and those who have been given the book certainly know that it is the truth from their lord . and allah is not heedless of what they do . 145 and even if you should bring to those who have been given the book every sign they would not follow jour qiblah  nor can jou be a follower of their qiblah  neither are they the follow ers of each other s qiblah . c and ifjou should follow their desires after the knowledge that has come to jou  then jou would indeed be from among the wrongdoers . 146 those whom we have given the book recognize him as they recognize their sons  but some of any step until he had received the divine revelation . if his revelations had been the outcome of his own desires he would not have waited for sixteen months for a revelation from on high to change the qiblah . a  1441  the holy prophet is here told that the kabah will not remain an idol temple  as he will soon be master of it  and idolatry will forever be swept off from the new spiritual centre of the world . b  1442  the truth of the prophet was manifest so far as the jews and the christians were concerned . there was a clear prophecy for the appearance of a prophet who was to be the like of moses  see deut . 181518 . they also knew that god had promised to bless ishmael  but that no prophet had up to this time appeared from among the ishmaelites . they also knew that ishmael was left in arabia  and they identified his son  kedar  with the arabs . isaiah 2113 speaks in clear words of a prophecy about  arabia  and of the prophet s flight . the bait allah  kabah  was the only beitel that the world knew . c  145  every sign of the prophet s truth had been given to them already but their hearts were so hardened that they did not pay any attention to the clearest signs . but they were not agreed even among themselves . although the jews and christians both looked to the temple at jerusalem as their central temple  they were not agreed upon it as their qiblah or spiritual centre . d  146  all the prophets of abraham s seed had hitherto appeared among the children of israel  and hence as they know their sons is equivalent to as they 2  147 â€¢ the kabah as the spiritual centre 33 them surely conceal the truth while they know . 147 the truth is from your lord  so do not be from among the doubters .  section 18  the kabah as the spiritual centre 148 and everyone has a goal to which he turns  himself   so vie with one another in good works .  wherever you are  allah will bring you all together . surely allah is powerful over all things . 149 and from whatsoever place you come forth  turn your face towards the sacred mosque . e and surely it is the truth from your know the israelite prophets  the significance being that the israelites or the jews recognized the prophet who appeared among the children of ishmael  as they recognized the prophets who appeared among the children of israel . a  147  it is the reader who is addressed here . b  148  in making the kabah the spiritual centre the muslims are told that their goal  as a nation  is to lead the world on to the greatest good . their race is not a race for material benefits  riches or power  but a race for the attainment of good and for the spread of good . hence they must vie with one another in doing good . in the words that follow â€ ” wherever you are  allah will bring you all together â€ ” they are told that they will be spread far and wide in the world  yet their goal must be one . the outward unity of the qiblah stands for their unity of purpose  and it forms the basis on which rests the brotherhood of islam  hence the saying of the prophet   do not call those who follow your qiblah unbelievers  . c  149  the kabah has never been supposed by any muslim to possess any divine attribute . the muslims honour the kabah because it is their spiritual centre  they do not worship it . it should also be borne in mind that the famous black stone was not one of the arab idols  nor can the kissing of it in performing the pilgrimage be looked upon as a remnant of idolatry . that stone stands only as a monument   the stone which the builders rejected has become the chief corner stone   psalms  11822  . ishmael was looked upon as rejected  and the covenant was considered to have been made with the children of isaac  yet it was that rejec ted stone  for which the black stone at the kabah stands as a monument  that was to become  the chief cornerstone  . jesus christ made this clear in the parable of the husbandmen  when he plainly told the israelites that the vineyard  i.e.  the kingdom of god  would be taken away from them and given to  other husband men   i.e . to a nonisraelite people  giving indication of that people in the words   have you never read in the scriptures  the stone which the builders rejected has become the chief cornerstone    matthew  2142  . and he added   the kingdom of god will be taken from you and given to a nation bearing the fruits of it   matthew  2143   thus showing that he was referring to a rejected nation which was to become the cornerstone of the divine kingdom . 34 2 . the cow â€¢ 2  150 lord . and allah is not heedless of what you do . 150 and from whatsoever place you come forth  turn your face towards the sacred mosque . and wherever you are  turn your faces towards it  so that people may have no plea against you except such of them as are unjust â€ ” so do not fear them and fear me â€ ” and that i may complete my favour to you and that you may go aright .  151 even as we have sent among you a messenger from among you  who recites to you our messages and purifies you and teaches you the book and the wisdom and teaches you what you did not know . 152 therefore glorify me  i will make you eminent  and give thanks to me and do not be ungrateful to me . section 19  hard trials necessary to establish truth 153 o you who believe  seek assistance through patience and prayer  surely allah is with the patient . 154 and do not speak of those who are slain in allah s way as dead . rather   they are  alive  but you do not perceive . 155 and we shall certainly try you a  150  by completing of favour is meant the bestowing of spiritual favours on the muslims . in the next verse they are told that they have been raised to carry the divine message to other people and to purify them and teach them the book and the wisdom . if that message was not conveyed to other people they had a plea against the muslims that they had not conveyed the truth to them . the turn ing of the face to the sacred mosque is thus equivalent to proclaiming the truth which had its origin in the kabah to the whole world . the kabah was the house rebuilt by abraham and ishmael  and with prophethood now being transferred to the descendants of ishmael  the spiritual centre had necessarily to be changed . the kabah was moreover the first spiritual centre of the world  396   and it was in the fitness of things that it should be the last spiritual centre of the whole world . b  151  the reference is to abraham s prayer in v. 129 . the functions of the promised prophet there are exactly the same as here . c  152  these words may be translated either as remember me i will remem ber you or as glorify me i will make you eminent  for the word dhikr carries either significance  remembrance or honouring . adopting either significance  what is stated here is that if the muslims keep god in the forefront of their programme  they will be made great as a nation . d  154  the sacrifice of life which must be undertaken in the cause of truth is hinted at in this passage . the words rendered literally as in allah s way or in 2  156 â€¢ hard trials necessary to establish truth 35 with something of fear and hunger and loss of property and lives and fruits . and give good news to the patient   156 who  when a misfortune befalls them  say  surely we are allah s  and to him we shall return . 157 those are they on whom are blessings and mercy from their lord  and those are the followers of the right course . 158 the safa and the marwah are truly among the signs of allah  c so whoever makes a pilgrimage to the house or pays a visit  to it   there is no blame on him if he goes round them . and whoever does good spontaneously â€ ” surely allah is bountiful in rewarding  knowing . 159 those who conceal the clear proofs and the guidance that we revealed after we have made it clear in the book for people  these it is whom allah curses  and those who the cause of allah  frequently occurring in the holy quran  signify the cause of truth . a christian translator s comment that the words in the way of allah mean  war undertaken against unbelievers for the propagation of islam  is baseless . carrying the message of islam to nonmuslims is indeed the duty of a muslim  and anyone engaged in this work is undoubtedly working in the way of allah  but that a muslim was required to carry the message of god at the point of the sword is no more than a myth . a  155  the muslims had already made great sacrifices in the cause of allah . they had left their homes  their near and dear ones and everything they had  behind them at makkah  and had come to madinah emptyhanded  but they were now told that they would have to make more sacrifices yet . they would have to face fear and hunger and all kinds of losses  even death itself . if they bore all these sufferings with steadfastness  they would have a great future  of which the good news is given to them beforehand . those who have sacrificed their lives in the cause of truth gain the life eternal  while the dead are really those who are dead in ignorance . b  156  this is the true expression of a muslim s resignation under trials  we are allah s and to him we shall return . he resigns himself to the will of god so thoroughly that no trial or misfortune can disturb the course of his life  which has a much higher goal before it than mere comfort . c  158  the safa and the marwah are two mountains near makkah . they were the scene of hagar s running to and fro in quest of water when left alone with ishmael in the wilderness . these two mountains now serve as two monu ments of the reward which patience brought  and it is as a memorial to hagar s patience that they are now gone round by the pilgrims . 36 2 . the cow â€¢ 2  160 curse  curse them  too  .  160 except those who repent and amend and make manifest  the truth   these it is to whom i turn  merci fully   and i am the oftreturning  to mercy   the merciful . 161 those who disbelieve and die while they are disbelievers  these it is on whom is the curse of allah and the angels and people  of all  of them    162 abiding in it  their punishment shall not be light ened nor shall they be given respite . 163 and your god is one god  there is no god but he  he is the beneficent  the merciful . c section 20  unity must prevail 164 in the creation of the heavens and the earth  and the alter nation of night and day  and the ships that run in the sea with that which benefits mankind  and the water that allah sends down from the sky  then gives life with it to the earth after its death and spreads in it all  kinds of  animals  and the changing of the winds and the clouds made subservient between heaven and earth  there are surely signs for a people who understand . 165 yet there are some people who take for themselves objects of worship besides a  159  as against those who willingly endure all kinds of sufferings in the cause of truth  the quran now speaks of people who hide the truth  i.e.  they neither act according to it  nor do they carry the message to others . these words convey a warning to the muslims . 6  161  this verse continues the subjectmatter of v. 159  the disbelievers spoken of here being those who hide the truth . the curse of god stands for their estrangement from god  the curse of the angels signifies their loss of all incentive to good and noble deeds  and the curse of people signifies their subjugation to other people . c  163  the mention of divine unity is to show that it was for this object that the trials and privations spoken of in this section were to be undergone . the ultimate triumph of divine unity is spoken of in the next section . d  164  the unity of god is declared by the whole of nature  and being such a clear doctrine  must no doubt at last prevail over idolatry and polytheism of every kind . not only did arabia witness the truth of this at the time of the holy prophet  but even today we see that  as man is freed from the trammels of pre judice  he realizes the truth of divine unity more and more . the uniformity that is clearly observed in the diversity of nature is constantly appealed to in the quran as a sign of the unity of the maker . 2  166 â€¢ unity must prevail 37 allah   whom they love as they should love allah . and those who believe are stronger in  their  love for allah . and if only the wrongdoers had seen  when they see the punishment  that power is wholly allah s  and that allah is severe in punishing  166 when those who were followed renounce those who followed  them   and they see the punishment and their ties are cut apart . i fi7 and those who followed will say  if only we could return  we would renounce them as they have renounced us . thus will allah show them their deeds to be intense regret to them  and they will not escape from the fire . c section 21  prohibited foods 168 o people  eat the lawful and good things from what is in the earth  and do not follow the footsteps of the devil . surely he is an open enemy to you . 169 he commands you only  to commit  evil and indecency  and that you speak against allah what you do not know . a  1651  the objects of worship here referred to may include idols  but the reference is apparently to the leaders who lead their followers into evil . this is made plain by the verses that follow  where  those who were followed   i.e . the leaders  renounce those who followed them . b  1652  while allah s love for his creatures is the everrecurring theme expressed in the quran  the believer s love for allah  or absolute submission to the divine being  is here declared to be stronger than all other ties of love and friendship  including that which unites a man to his idols or other false deities . c  167  the mutual renouncement of the leaders and their followers takes place sometimes in this very life . it should also be noted that it is the intense regret for the evil deeds done  here described as being the fire  from which there is no escape . rf  168  the fundamental principle of faith  divine unity  having been discussed  certain secondary rules and regulations are now considered  and among these the subject of prohibited foods is introduced first with a twofold object . firstly  only lawful and good things should be eaten . lawful things are not only those which the law has not declared to be forbidden  but even unforbidden things become unlawful if they are acquired unlawfully  by theft  cheating  etc . secondly  by adding the injunction do not follow the footsteps of the devil  the quran recognizes some sort of relation between the physical and the spiritual conditions of man . 38 2 . the cow â€¢ 2  170 170 and when it is said to them  follow what allah has revealed  they say  but we follow that  path  upon which we found our fathers . what  even though their fathers had no sense at all  nor did they follow the right way . 171 and the parable of those who disbelieve is as the parable of one who calls out to that which hears no more than a call and a cry . deaf  dumb  blind  so they have no sense .  172 you who believe  eat of the good things that we have provided you with  and give thanks to allah if he it is whom you serve . 173 he has forbidden you only what dies of itself  and blood  and the flesh of swine  e and that on which any other name than that of allah has been invoked . then whoever is driven by necessity  not desiring  nor exceeding the limit  no sin is upon him . surely allah is forgiving  merciful . 174 those who conceal anything of the book that allah has revealed and take for it a small price  they eat nothing but fire into their bellies and allah will not speak to them on the day of a  171  the prophet is likened to the crier who calls out  but the disbelievers are deaf to reason  and are like cattle which only hear the cry of the driver  but do not understand the meaning of what he says . this is in accordance with what is said in the previous verse . b  172  the injunction to eat of the good things is directed against the use of things which are injurious to health  though they may not be forbidden by law . c  1731  the jews held the swine in great detestation  and the mention of the animal in the gospels shows that jesus christ held it in equal abhorrence  which proves that he too regarded the animal as impure . neither does he appear to have broken the jewish law in this respect . d  1732  the words that over which any other name than that of allah has been invoked are said by commentators to refer to animals slaughtered by the worshippers of idols  which they used to slaughter as offerings to their idols or to those over which the name of an idol is invoked at the time of its slaughter . but the statement made in the quran is general  and the invocation of any name other than that of allah makes the animal slaughtered unlawful . e  174  the prohibition to eat certain impure or injurious foods is followed by a warning against the eating of fire . caution is always given lest too much stress should be laid upon the outward ceremonial of the law . even more dangerous than the prohibited foods is the eating of fire  which means the concealing of what is revealed in the book . the concealment in this case means not acting upon the teaching of the book . the muslims are warned of the danger of being strict in external acts of purity while neglecting internal purity . 2175  retaliation and bequests 39 resurrection  nor will he purify them  and for them is a painful punishment . 175 those are they who buy error for guidance and punishment for forgiveness  how bold they are to challenge the fire  176 that is because allah has revealed the book with truth . and surely those who disagree about the book go far in opposi tion .  section 22  retaliation and bequests 177 it is not righteousness that you turn your faces towards the east and the west  but righteous is the one who believes in allah  and the last day  and the angels e and the book and the a  176  by those who disagree about the book are meant people who accept one part of the divine revelation and reject the other  as the jews and the chris tians did  the book in this case standing for the whole of the divine revelation which is accepted by the muslims only . or  the book stands for the quran  and their disagreement means their rejection of it . b  1771  a warning is given to the muslims that they should not fall into the error into which the previous people fell  who sacrificed the spirit of religion for the outward ceremonial . the essence of religion is faith in god and benevo lence towards people . the turning of the face to the east and the west refers to the outward act of facing a certain direction when saying prayers . this  though necessary  should not be taken as the real object of prayer  which is in fact meant to enable one to hold communion with the divine being and to imbue oneself with divine morals as explained further on . c  1772  a belief in angels is one of the basic principles of islam . this belief is accepted generally in all monotheistic religions . as in the case of all other principles of faith  islam has pointed out a certain significance underlying the belief in angels . there are two attractions placed in humans â€ ” the attraction to good or to rise up to higher spheres of virtue  and the attraction to evil or to stoop down to a kind of low  bestial life . if we respond to the attraction for good we are following the angel or the holy spirit  and if we respond to the attraction for evil we are following the devil . our belief in angels carries  therefore  the sig nificance that whenever we feel a tendency to do good we should at once obey that call . it does not simply mean that we should admit that there are angels . this is clear from the fact that not only are we not required to believe in devils  whose existence is as certain as that of the angels  but we are plainly told that we should disbelieve in the devils  2256  . as a disbelief in the devil means that we should repel the attraction for evil  so a belief in angels means that we should follow the inviter to good . 40 2 . the cow â€¢ 2  178 prophets  and gives away wealth out of love for him to the near of kin and the orphans and the needy and the traveller and to those who ask and to set slaves free c and keeps up prayer and gives the due charity  and the performers of their promise when they make a promise  and the patient in distress and affliction and in the time of conflict . these are they who are truthful  and these are they who keep their duty . 178 o you who believe  retaliation is prescribed for you in the matter of the slain  the free for the free  and the slave for the slave  and the female for the female . 2 but if remission is made to one by his  aggrieved  brother  prosecution  for bloodmoney  should be according to usage  and payment to him in a good manner this is an alleviation from your lord and a mercy . whoever exceeds the limit after this  will have a painful punishment . 179 and there is life for you in retaliation  you people of understanding  that you may guard yourselves . a  1773  the book stands for divine revelation in general or the scriptures of all the prophets . b  1774  the love of allah is here  as in many other places in the quran  stated to be the true incentive to all deeds of righteousness . c  1775  the basis was thus laid down for the abolition of slavery . d  1776  the performance of promise on the part of individuals as well as of nations is one of the first essentials of the welfare of humanity  and hence the stress laid upon it by the quran . faithlessness to treaties and pledges on the part of nations has wrought the greatest havoc on humanity . just as no society can prosper until its individual members are true to their mutual agreements and promises to each other  so humanity at large can never have peace unless the nations are true to their agreements . e  1781  the jewish law of retaliation is greatly modified in islam  being limited only to cases of murder  while among the jews it extended to all cases of grievous hurt . the words retaliation is prescribed for you in the matter of the slain mean that the murderer should be put to death . the preislamic arabs used in certain cases to insist  when the person killed was of noble descent  upon the execution of others besides the murderer . the quran abolished this custom .   1782  there may be circumstances which alleviate the guilt . in such cases the murderer may be made to pay a fine to the relatives of the murdered person . such money is called diyat or bloodmoney . a comparison with 492 makes it clear that when homicide is not intentional  bloodmoney may be paid . 2180  fasting 41 180 it is prescribed for you  when death approaches one of you  if he leaves behind wealth for parents and near relatives  to make a bequest in a kindly manner  it is incumbent upon the dutiful .  181 then whoever changes it after he has heard it  the sin of it is only upon those who change it . surely allah is hearing  knowing . 182 but if one fears a wrong or a sinful course on the part of the testator  and effects an agreement between the parties  there is no blame on him . surely allah is forgiving  merciful . section 23  fasting 183 o you who believe  fasting is prescribed for you  as it was prescribed for those before you  so that you may guard against evil . 184 for a certain number of days . but whoever among you is sick or on a journey   he shall fast  a  like  number of other days . and those who find it extremely hard may effect redemption by feeding a poor one . c so whoever does good spontaneously  it is better for him  and that you fast is better for you if you know . a  180  some commentators hold the opinion that the direction here  to make a bequest  is abrogated by 41 1 which fixes the shares of the heirs of the deceased person . however  that verse clearly recognizes the validity of any bequest that may have been made . in practice  however  traced to the prophet himself  the right to make a will has been subject to the condition that not more than a third of the property shall be bequeathed  and that those who take as heirs shall not be entitled to take under the bequest . hence  this verse really speaks of bequests made for charitable purposes and not of bequests to heirs . b  183  fasting is a religious institution almost as universal as prayer  and in islam it is one of the five fundamental practical ordinances .  fasting has in all ages and among all nations been an exercise much in use in times of mourning  sorrow and affliction   cruden s bible concordance  . but islam has introduced quite a new meaning into the institution of fasting . it becomes an institution for the improvement of the moral and spiritual condition of man . this is plainly stated in the concluding words  so that you may guard against evil . the object is that man may learn how he can shun evil  and hence fasting in islam does not mean simply abstaining from food  but from every kind of evil . abstention from food is only a step to make a person realize that if he can  in obedience to divine injunctions  abstain from that which is otherwise lawful  how much more necessary is it to abstain from the evil ways which are forbidden by god . c  184  the first two classes exempted are   a  those who are sick and  b  those journeying . both are required to fast afterwards when sickness or 42 2 . the cow â€¢ 2  185 185 the month of ramadan  is that in which the quran was revealed   a guidance to people and clear proofs of the guidance and the criterion. so whoever of you is present in the month  he shall fast in it  and whoever is sick or on a journey   he shall fast  a  like  number of other days . allah desires ease for you  and he does not desire hardship for you  and  he desires  that you should complete the number and that you should exalt the greatness of allah for having guided you and that you may give thanks . 186 and when my servants ask you concerning me  surely i am near . i answer the prayer of the supplicant when he calls on me  so they should hear my call and believe in me that they may walk in the right way . journey ends . what is sickness or journey every person can determine for himself . someone who needs a medicine or is unable to bear the hardship of hunger or thirst should not fast . in journeying again  whether one can easily fast or not is the determining factor . the third exception is in the case of those who find it extremely difficult to bear the hardship of fasting . such people may effect a redemption by giving food daily to a poor person . this exception covers the case of pregnant women  women who are breast feeding infants  old people who can not bear fasting  also such sick people whose sickness is prolonged and such people whose journey extends over the whole year . a  1851  the revelation of the quran commenced in the month of ramadan  the ninth month of the arabian year  hence  the month of ramadan is particularly spoken of as being the month in which the quran was revealed . b  1852  elsewhere we are told that it was revealed on the lailat alqadr or the night of majesty  971   a wellknown night in the month of ramadan  being the 25th or 27th or 29th night of that month . by the revelation of the quran in the month of ramadan is therefore meant the commencement of its revelation . the month of ramadan is thus a memorial of the revelation of the quran . c  1853  firstly  the quran is a  guidance  for all people  and therefore it contains teachings suitable and sufficient for all people in all countries and ages . secondly  it contains  clear proofs  to demonstrate the truth of what it asserts . thirdly  it contains arguments which afford a  criterion   arabic furqan   separa ting truth from falsehood . d  186  this verse speaks of the nearness of god to man and of the accept ance of his prayers to show that fasting is a spiritual exercise and it brings about spiritual awakening in man . fasting undoubtedly awakens a living consciousness of the existence of god in the mind . this is the idea underlying the words   when my servants ask you concerning me  . a real and earnest search for god is raised 2187 fasting 43 187 it is made lawful for you to have intercourse with your wives on the night of the fast . they are an apparel for you and you are an apparel for them . a allah knows that you acted unjustly to yourselves  so he turned to you in mercy and removed  the burden  from you . so now be in contact with them and seek what allah has ordained for you  and eat and drink until the whiteness of the day becomes distinct from the blackness of the night at dawn  then complete the fast till nightfall and do not touch them while you keep to the mosques . these are the limits of allah  so do not go near them . thus does allah make clear his messages for people that they may keep their duty . 188 and do not swallow up your pro perty among yourselves by false means  nor seek to gain access thereby to the judges  so that you may swallow up a part of the property of  other  people wrongfully while you know . 6 in the mind through fasting .  i am near  is the reply to that inner search . and then follow the words   i answer the prayer of the supplicant when he calls on me  . god is near  but that consciousness only raises the further desire to get nearer and nearer to him . for that man calls on god  he prays to him to draw him closer and closer to himself . and he is told that god accepts this prayer . a  1871  first  the sex instinct is classed with hunger and thirst . it is a natural desire and one could not live without satisfying it . and then in these words â€ ” your wives are an apparel for you and you are an apparel for them â€ ” we are told that while satisfying a natural desire  the relation of husband and wife has higher ends in view . they serve as a garment for each other  i.e.  they are a means of protection  comfort and even embellishment for each other  and the weakness of one is made up by the strength of the other . b  1872  muslims at first thought that it was illegal to have intercourse with their wives even at night  on the days during which they kept fasts . these words made it clear that this was permitted during the nights of fasting as the satisfaction of hunger and thirst was permitted . c  1873  in countries where the days are sometimes very long  the time of fasting may be measured in accordance with the length of an ordinary day  or where practicable postpone the fasts to shorter days of about normal length . d  1874  those people are meant who cut themselves off from all worldly connections during the last ten days of ramadan  passing day and night in the mosques . this practice  known as itikaf is voluntary and not obligatory . e  188  the command to abstain from illegally taking other people s pro perty is a fitting sequel to the injunction relating to fasting  for by fasting a person abstains from using what he has a legal right to  simply in obedience to divine 44 2 . the cow â€¢ 2  189 section 24  fighting in defence 189 they ask you about the new moons . say  they are times appointed for people  and  for  the pilgrimage . a and it is not righteousness that you enter houses by their backs  but he is righteous who keeps his duty . and go into houses by their doors  6 and keep your duty to allah  that you may be successful . 190 and fight in the way of allah against those who fight against you but do not be aggressive . surely allah does not love the aggressors . c 191 and kill them wherever you find them  and drive them out from where they drove you out  and persecution is worse than slaughter and do not fight with them at the sacred commandments . fasting  in fact  enables one to control his passions  and the more the passions are mastered  the less the greed for illegal acquisition . a  1891  the reference in  new moons  is in particular to the four months of the year which the arabs observed as sacred  the 11th  12th  1st and 7th  . all hostilities ceased and peace was established throughout the land  thus trade was carried on without molestation . the pilgrimage to makkah was also performed during these months . b  1892  entering by the back indicates turning aside from the right course  while entering by the doors signifies sticking to the right course . this also refers to a superstitious custom of preislamic arabs  whereby when one of them failed to attain his objective he would not enter his house by the door but by the back . c  190  this is one of the earliest revelations permitting muslims to fight . it is remarkable that fighting in the way of allah is here expressly limited to fighting in defence . muslims were required to fight in the way of allah  but they could fight only against those who waged war on them . exactly the same limitation is placed on what was in all probability the first revelation permitting fighting   permission  to fight  is given to those on whom war is made because they are oppressed   2239  . muslims were allowed to take up the sword only as a measure of selfdefence . the enemies of islam  being unable to suppress islam by perse cution  and seeing that islam was now safe at madinah and gaining strength  took up the sword to annihilate it . no course was left for the muslims but either to be swept off the face of the earth or take up the sword in defence against an enemy which was immensely stronger . d  1911  the words kill them refer to those with whom fighting is enjoined in the previous verse  who waged war upon the muslims . e  1912  the word translated as  persecution  is fitna . ibn umar explained the w or d fitna when he said   and there were very few muslims  in the begin ning   so a man used to be persecuted on account of his religion  they either 2  192 â€¢ fighting in defence 45 mosque until they fight with you in it  so if they fight you  in it   kill them . such is the recompense of the disbelievers . 192 but if they cease  then surely allah is forgiving  merciful .  193 and fight them until there is no persecution  and religion is only for allah . but if they cease  then there should be no hostility except against the oppressors . 194 the sacred month for the sacred month  and retaliation  is allowed  in sacred things . c whoever then acts aggressively against you  inflict injury on him according to the injury he has inflicted on you and keep your duty to allah  and know that allah is with those who keep their duty . 195 and spend in the way of allah and do not cast yourselves to destruction with your own hands and do good  to others  . surely allah loves the doers of good . 196 and accomplish the pilgrimage and the visit for allah . but if you are prevented   send  whatever offering is easy to obtain  and do not shave your heads until the offering reaches its destination . then whoever among you is sick or has an ailment of the head   he may effect  a compensation by fasting or  giving in  charity or sacrificing . and when you are secure  whoever profits by combining the visit with the pilgrimage  should take  whatever offering is easy to obtain . but he who can not find  an offering  should fast for three days during the pilgrimage and for seven days murdered him or subjected him to tortures until islam became predominant  then there was aofitna   bukhari  65.230  . a  192  note the clemency of the islamic fighting injunctions . muslims were to sheathe their swords if the enemy desisted from fighting . b  193  when persecution ceases  and people are not forced to accept or renounce a religion  then there should be no more fighting . if they cease persecu tion  muslims are at once to stop fighting against them  and hostilities are not to be continued against any except the aggressors . c  194  this is similar to what is said in v. 191 regarding the sacred mosque . the preislamic arabs observed four months in the year as sacred  in which hostilities ceased and peace was established throughout the land . if the opponents violated the sacred months by attacking the muslims first in those months  the muslims were permitted to fight against them in the sacred months . and generally retaliation within the limits of the original act of aggression is permitted in the case of all sacred objects . 46 2 . the cow â€¢ 2  197 when you return . these are ten  days  complete . this is for him whose family is not present in the sacred mosque . and keep your duty to allah  and know that allah is severe in retribution .  section 25  the pilgrimage 197 the months of the pilgrimage are well known  so who ever determines to perform pilgrimage in them  there shall be no immodest speech  nor abusing  nor altercation in the pilgri mage . and whatever good you do  allah knows it . and make provision for yourselves  the best provision being to keep one s duty . and keep your duty to me  you people of understanding . 198 it is no sin for you that you seek the bounty of your lord . e so when you press on from arafat  remember allah near the holy a  196  the two subjects of war and pilgrimage are linked because muslims were free at madinah to perform all the religious ordinances required by islam  but they were not free to perform the pilgrimage  their spiritual centre  makkah  being in the possession of their enemies who were at war with them . the  visit  or umrah may be performed at any time  whilst the  pilgrimage  or hajj can only be performed at a particular time of the year . the pilgrimage represents the last stage in the progress of the spiritual pilgrim . the first requirement of the pilgri mage  ihram  represents the severance of all worldly connections for the love of god . all costly dresses in which the inner self is so often mistaken for the out ward appearance  are cast off  and the pilgrim has only two seamless wrappers to cover himself . the other important requirement is making circuits round the kabah  called tawaf  and running between the safa and the marwah  called sa y  and both these are external manifestations of that fire of divine love which has been kindled within the heart  so that like the true lover  the pilgrim makes circuits round the house of his beloved one . b  197  the pilgrimage represents the final stage of spiritual progress  and hence the pilgrim is told not to speak words which should be a source of annoy ance to anybody . perfect love of god requires perfect peace with fellow beings  hence no offence should be caused to anyone . the doing of good to others is re commended instead in the words whatever good you do  allah knows it . c  1981  seeking the bounty of the lord here stands for trading . what is meant is that there is no harm in seeking an increase of wealth by trading in makkah in the pilgrimage season . d  1982  arafat is the place where the pilgrims assemble on the 9th of the month of dhiilhiijah  towards the close of the pilgrimage . here the vast gather ing from all countries and nations clad in one dress  with one utterance  labbaika 2  199 â€¢ the pilgrimage 47 monument   and remember him as he has guided you  though before that you were certainly in error . 199 then hasten on from where the people hasten on  and ask the forgiveness of allah . surely allah is forgiving  merciful . 200 and when you have performed your devotions  extol allah as you extolled your fathers  rather a stronger extolling but there are some people who say  our lord  give us  good  in the world . and for such there is no portion in the hereafter . 201 and there are some among them who say  our lord  grant us good in this world and good in the hereafter  and save us from the punishment of the fire . d 202 for those there is a portion on account of what they have earned . and allah is swift in reckoning . 203 and remember allah during the appointed days . then whoever hastens off in two days  it is no sin for him  and whoever stays behind  it is no sin for him  for one who keeps his duty . 6 and keep your duty to allah  and know that you will be gathered together to him . allahumma labbaika  here i am  o allah  in your presence   declares the glory of god . the word arafat is derived from arafa  meaning he knew  or acquainted himself with  a thing  and there is undoubtedly a reference in this name to the fact that here people feel truly the august divine presence . a  1983  this is the place known as muzdalafah  or the ground bordering on it  where the pilgrims stop for the night after their return from arafat on the eve ning of the 9th dhulhijiah . b  199  the quraish and the kananah used to stay at muzdalafah  thinking it beneath their dignity to join other pilgrims in going to the plain of arafat . as all distinctions were levelled by islam  they were told to consider themselves on a par with others c  200  in preislamic times people used to boast among themselves of the greatness of their fathers after they had performed the pilgrimage . the quran for bade people to boast of the greatness of their fathers  and told them to celebrate the praise of allah instead . d  201  this is the true muslim s prayer . as he is taught to pray for both the good of this life and that of the next  so he should exert himself to attain good in this life as well as in the hereafter . e  203  the appointed days are the three days following the day of sacrifice  and are called the days of tashrlq . ordinarily pilgrims leave on the afternoon of the last day of tashrlq days  but they are allowed to leave on the evening of the second day . 48 2 . the cow â€¢ 2  204 204 and among people is he whose speech about the life of this world pleases you  and he calls allah to witness as to what is in his heart  yet he is the most violent of adversaries . 205 and when he holds authority  he makes effort in the land to cause mischief in it and destroy crops and offspring  and allah does not love mischief . 206 and when it is said to him  be careful of your duty to allah  pride carries him off to sin â€ ” so hell is sufficient for him . and certainly evil is the restingplace . a 207 and among people is he who sells himself to seek the pleasure of allah . and allah is compassionate to the servants . 208 o you who believe  enter into complete peace and do not follow the footsteps of the devil . surely he is your open enemy . 209 but if you slip after clear arguments have come to you  then know that allah is mighty  wise . 210 they only wait that allah should come to them in the shadows of the clouds with angels  and the matter has  already  been decided . and to allah are  all  matters returned . section 26  trials and tribulations 211 ask the children of israel how many a clear sign we gave them  and whoever changes the favour of allah after it has come to him  then surely allah is severe in retribution . 212 the life of this world is made to seem attractive to those who disbelieve  and they mock those who believe . and those who keep their duty will be above them on the day of resurrection . and allah gives to whom he pleases without measure . a  206  mihad   restingplace   means a cradle  and also what a man has prepared for himself . hell is a thing which a man prepares for himself  and for a new spiritual growth in the hereafter in the case of those who retarded that growth in this world  it serves the same purpose as the cradle for a child . else where hell is called an umm or mother  1019  . b  210  the coming of allah stands for the coming of the threatened punish ment for those who wanted to annihilate islam . the matter has already been decided  because it was repeatedly made clear in the earliest revelations that all opposition to islam would perish . c  211  the favour of allah is the quran and its change implies its rejection . 2213  trials and tribulations 49 213 mankind is a single nation.  so allah raised prophets as bearers of good news and as warners  and he revealed with them the book with truth  that it might judge between people in that in which they differed . and none but the very people who were given it differed about it after clear arguments had come to them  envying one another so allah has guided by his will those who believe to the truth about which they differed . and allah guides whom he pleases to the right path . 214 0r do you think that you will enter the garden  while there has not yet come upon you the like of what befell those who have passed away before you . distress and affliction befell them and they were shaken violently  so that the messenger and those who believed with him said  when will the help of allah come  now surely the help of allah is near  e a  2131  the oneness of humanity is a truth on which the quran lays the greatest stress . they are sometimes told that they have all been  created of a single being   41   again that they are all descended from the same parents  4913   still again that they are as it were dwellers in one home  having the same earth as a restingplace and the same heaven as a canopy  222  . hence also the conclusion that prophets were raised among all nations which is conveyed in the words that follow . b  2132  as all people are a single nation  umma   god  too  has been revealing himself to all . this law of divine revelation has  we are told  found expression through prophets  to every one of whom a revealed book was given to show them the right way . c  2133  the universal law expressed here is that corruption followed gui dance . as time passed on  the very people to whom the book was given so that they might follow it  went against it . thus  though a prophet had been raised in every nation  yet every nation had forsaken the right way . differences again arose which necessitated the advent of another prophet . hence it was necessary to raise a prophet who should show the right way to all nations  and this is what is stated in the words that follow . d  2134  allah s guiding those who believe refers to the raising of the prophet muhammad  through whom muslims were guided to the right path  to the truth  regarding which differences had arisen among all people . if a prophet was needed by every nation to settle its own differences  one was surely now needed to settle the differences of the various nations . thus among the different national religions of the world  islam occupies the position of an international religion . e  214  this verse inculcates faith and perseverance under the hardest trials 50 2 . the cow â€¢ 2  215 215 they ask you as to what they should spend . say  what ever wealth you spend  it is for the parents and the near of kin and the orphans and the needy and the traveller . and whatever good you do  allah surely is knower of it . 216 fighting is ordained for you  though it is disliked by you  and it may be that you dislike a thing while it is good for you  and it may be that you love a thing while it is harmful for you  and allah knows while you do not know .  section 27  miscellaneous questions 217 they ask you about fighting in the sacred month . say  fighting in it is a grave  offence  . and hindering  people  from allah s way and denying him and the sacred mosque and turning its people out of it  are still graver with allah  and persecution is graver than slaughter . and they will not cease fighting you until they turn you back from your religion  if they can . 6 and whoever of you turns back from his religion  then he dies while an un believer â€ ” these it is whose deeds are fruitless in this world and the hereafter . e and they are the companions of the fire  in it they and is an indication of the prophet s own unequalled endurance and faith . it refers not only to the great trials and hardships which muslims had already suffered at makkah and the privations which they had to undergo in their exile  but more particularly to the hardships which were yet in store for them  and which they could clearly see in the massing of all forces that could be used to annihilate them . a  216  muslims were too weak to carry on the struggle against the mighty forces that were bent upon their destruction  and they disliked the war . a picture of distresses and afflictions to which the few converts to islam were subjected is drawn in v. 214 . they were few in numbers  poor  exiled  and distressed  yet it became inevitable that they should fight in selfdefence or they would be des troyed . it was their utter weakness and the enormous disparity of numbers that made them dislike the fighting . b  2171  the unbelievers took up the sword to force the muslims back into unbelief and they were determined to carry on the war until they gained this end . note the words they will not cease fighting you until they turn you back from your religion  if they can  which disprove the false allegation that the muslims started war to convert the unbelievers by force . c  2172  the persons spoken of here are the apostates . a wrong impression exists that those who apostatize from islam are to be put to death . this is entirely 2218  miscellaneous questions 51 will abide . 218 those who believed and those who fled  their homes  and strove hard in allah s way â€ ” these surely hope for the mercy of allah . and allah is forgiving  merciful . 219 they askjou about intoxicants  and games of chance . say  in both of them is a great sin and  some  advantage for people  and their sin is greater than their advantage . and they ask you as to what they should spend . say  what you can spare . thus does allah make clear to you the messages that you may ponder 220 on this world and the hereafter . and they ask you concerning the orphans . c say  to set right their affairs is good  and if you mix with them  they are your brethren . and allah knows him who untrue . what is stated here is that the opponents of islam exerted themselves to their utmost to turn back the muslims from their faith by their cruel persecutions  and therefore if a muslim actually went back to unbelief he would be a loser in this life as well as in the next  because the desertion of islam would not only deprive him of spiritual advantages  but also of the physical advantages which must accrue to the muslims through the ultimate triumph of islam . neither here nor anywhere else in the quran is there even a hint at the infliction of capital or any other punishment on the apostate . in the matter of religion  the quran gives perfect freedom to all to adopt whatever religion they like   and say  the truth is from your lord  so whoever wishes  let him believe  and whoever wishes  let him disbelieve   1829  . a  2191  the word khamr used here includes all intoxicating substances . the prohibition spoken of here as regards both intoxicating liquors and games of chance is made plainer in 590 . the prohibition of intoxicants in connection with the mention of war shows that islam wanted to inspire true courage into its followers and disliked the reckless daring which a man shows under the influence of intoxicating liquors and which has so often led to atrocities in wars . the constant fighting of arab tribes  one against the other  had made the habit of drink second nature to the arab . intoxicating liquors were the chief feature of their feasts  and the habit of drink was not considered an evil  nor had there ever been a temperance movement among them . yet one word of the holy quran was suffi cient to blot out all traces of it from among a whole nation . b  2192  intoxicants and gambling are both declared in 591 as causing  enmity and hatred among you   and a society the members of which are imbued with feelings of hatred and enmity towards each other could never prosper . c  2201  from the earliest  the revelations of the quran always speak of the orphans  the needy  and the slaves in the kindest words  and lay special stress on helping and feeding them . see 90  1116 and other places . d  2202  orphans are not to be treated as a separate class  and they should 52 2 . the cow â€¢ 2  221 makes mischief from him who sets  affairs  right . and if allah pleased  he would have made matters difficult for you . surely allah is mighty  wise . 221 and do not marry female idolaters until they believe  and certainly a believing maid is better than a female idolater even though she please you . nor give  believing women  in marriage to idolaters until they believe  and certainly a believing slave is better than an idolater  even though he please you . these invite to the fire and allah invites to the garden and to forgiveness by his will and he makes clear his messages to people that they may be mindful . section 28  divorce 222 and they ask jou about menstruation .  say  it is harmful  so keep aloof from women during menstrual discharge and do not approach them  for intercourse  until they are clean . but when they have cleansed themselves  go to them as allah has commanded you . surely allah loves those who turn much  to him   and he loves those who purify themselves . 223 your wives are a tilth for you  so go to your tilth when you like  and send  good deeds  beforehand for yourselves  and have regard for your duty to allah and know that you will meet him . e and give good news to the believers . not be treated as living on the charity of others  they must be treated as brethren . a  2221  just as war made many children orphans  it made many women widows  but questions relating to widowhood and divorce being somewhat analo gous  the two questions are treated together here and further on . b  2222  the word used  adhan  signifies anything that causes a slight harm . it is not  however  the menstrual discharge that is called harmful here but having sexual relations while the woman is in that condition . the jewish law con tains a similar prohibition in leviticus 1819 and 2018  though jewish practice rendered it necessary that the separation between husband and wife should be complete . in islam  it is limited to the cessation of sexual intercourse as the answer here shows . c  223  this verse shows that the real object of marital relations is not simply the satisfaction of sexual desires .  editor s note  the comparison of women to the land that is tilled is to show that it is through them that the crop of 2  224 â€¢ divorce 53 224 and do not make allah by your oaths a hindrance to your doing good and keeping your duty and making peace between people . and allah is hearing  knowing . 225 allah will not call you to account for what is vain in your oaths  but he will call you to account for what your hearts have earned . and allah is forgiv ing  forbearing . 226 those who swear that they will not have sexual relations with their wives should wait four months  e then if they go back  allah is forgiving  merciful . 227 and if they resolve on a divorce allah is surely hearing  knowing . 228 divorced women the next generation of human beings grows and develops  both physically and in character . men are also told here to do some act of moral goodness before approaching their wives sexually  and to have regard for duty to god which stands for having regard for one s duties towards others as required by god . thus the husband is required to be mindful also of moral duty and responsibility in the matter of sexual relations with his wife  so that it should not be merely an occasion for him to gratify his lust selfishly with no regard for moral goodness or the rights of his wife .  a  224  this verse refers to the preislamic arab custom of tla   a way of temporarily putting off the wife which was effected by an oath in allah s name not to have sexual relations with her . the result of this was that the husband considered himself free from all marital obligations . the first step to bring about a reform in the relations of husband and wife was that this practice was abolished . it is in reference to this that the taking of oaths against the doing of good to others is prohibited . the fulfilment of marital obligations is thus referred to as the doing of good and observance of duty and making peace between people . but the subject is generalized and the taking of all oaths to forbid oneself the doing of good or fulfilment of obligations is prohibited . see also 662 footnote . b  225  by vain oaths are meant unintentional or thoughtless oaths in ordinary conversation  and by what the hearts have earned is meant an oath intentionally taken . c  226  ila  signifies an oath by a man that he shall not approach his wife . in preislamic times the arabs used to take such oaths frequently  and as the period of suspension was not limited  the wife was compelled sometimes to pass her whole life having neither the position of a wife nor that of a divorced woman free to marry elsewhere . the quran declares that if the husband does not reassert conjugal relations within four months  the wife shall be divorced . cases in which husbands desert wives  having neither conjugal relations with them nor divorcing them  must be dealt with practically as amounting to tla   so that after four months the wife should be free if she wants a divorce . d  227  the islamic law of divorce is elastic and does not strictly limit the causes of divorce . divorce is allowed if sufficient reason exists  but the right is to 54 2 . the cow â€¢ 2  229 should keep themselves in waiting for three courses .  and it is not lawful for them to conceal what allah has created in their wombs  if they believe in allah and the last day . and their husbands have a better right to take them back in the meanwhile if they wish for reconciliation . and women have rights similar to those against them in a just manner  c and men are a degree above them . and allah is mighty  wise . section 29  divorce 229 divorce may be  pronounced  twice  e then keep  them  in good fellowship or let  them  go with kindness and it is not lawful be exercised under exceptional circumstances . a wife can claim a divorce accord ing to the islamic law  which was not a right conferred on her by jewish and christian laws on divorce as formulated in deuteronomy and matthew . a  2281  the period of waiting  or iddat  forms the first condition in the islamic law of divorce . but for cases in which marriage is not consummated  no period of waiting is necessary  see 3349. b  2282  these words give a clear right to the parties to effect a reconcilia tion and reestablish conjugal relations within the period of waiting . no special procedure is necessary for this but both the divorce and the reconciliation must take place in the presence of witnesses . if  however  the iddat is over and no reconciliation has been effected  the relation of husband and wife can be re established by remarriage  which right is given to the parties by v. 232. c  2283  the rights of women against their husbands are here stated to be similar to those which the husbands have against their wives . the change in this respect was really a revolutionizing one  for the arabs hitherto regarded women as mere property . women were now declared to have rights similar to those which were exercised against them . the equality of the rights of women with those of men was never previously recognized by any nation or any reformer . d  2284  the statement that  men are a degree above them  does not nullify the rights asserted in the previous passage . the words are added simply to show that the husband is the head of the household . e  2291  the divorce spoken of here is the revocable divorce of v. 228  after which a reconciliation may be effected in the waiting period . islam allows a revocable divorce on two occasions only  so that the period of waiting in each of these two cases might serve as a period of temporary separation during which conjugal relations could be reestablished . remarriage of the same parties is allowed after the lapse of the waiting period .   2292  the husband must make his choice after the second divorce either to retain the wife permanently or to bring about a final separation . the object of a 2  230 â€¢ divorce 55 for you to take any part of what you have given them   unless both fear that they can not keep within the limits of allah . then if you fear that they can not keep within the limits of allah  there is no blame on them for what she gives up to become free thereby . these are the limits of allah  so do not exceed them  and whoever exceeds the limits of allah  these are the wrongdoers . 230 so if he divorces her  the third time   c she shall not be lawful to him afterwards until she marries another husband . if he divorces her  there is no blame on them both if they return to each other  by marriage   if they think that they can keep within the limits of allah . and these are the limits of allah which he makes clear for a people who know . true marriage union is indicated in the simple words keep them in good fellowship . if good fellowship is entirely absent the only remedy is to let the woman go with kindness . a  2293  the full payment of the dowry to the wife by the husband is another condition relating to the islamic law of divorce .  this is the nuptial gift the hus band owes the wife  as agreed between them at the time of marriage .  b  2294  these words give the wife a right to claim a divorce . islam gives the wife the right to claim a divorce even on grounds of disliking her husband  if she is willing to forgo the whole or part of her dowry  i.e.  nuptial gift from the husband  . the words unless both fear that they can not keep within the limits of allah mean their inability to perform towards each other their marital obligations and to maintain good fellowship . the words if you fear refer to the properly cons tituted authorities and this shows that the authorities can interfere in the matter . c  2301  the words refer to the  letting go with kindness  of the previous verse  and hence by divorce here is meant the irrevocable divorce pronounced a third time  i.e.  after there has been a divorce and a restitution of conjugal rights twice . d  2302  when the wife has been divorced twice  after each of which reconciliation has been effected and has failed  the third divorce becomes irrevo cable . it is not simply by repeating the pronouncement of divorce three times that the third pronouncement becomes irrevocable . a divorce should actually have taken place twice  followed each time by reconciliation  then and only then the third divorce becomes irrevocable . it would  in fact  be very rare . after the third irrevocable divorce  the husband can not remarry the divorced wife until she has been married elsewhere and divorced  but it must be a genuine marriage and a genuine divorce . 56 2 . the cow â€¢ 2  23 1 231 and when you divorce women and they reach their prescribed time  then retain them with kindness or let them go with kindness and do not retain them for injury so that you exceed the limits .  and whoever does this  he indeed wrongs his own soul . and do not take allah s messages for a mockery   and remember allah s favour to you  and what he has revealed to you of the book and the wisdom  instructing you by it . and keep your duty to allah  and know that allah is the knower of all things . section 30  remarriage of divorced women and widows 232 and when you divorce women and they end their term  do not prevent them from marrying their husbands if they agree among themselves in a lawful manner . with this is instructed he among you who believes in allah and the last day . this is more virtuous for you and purer . and allah knows while you do not know . e 233 and mothers shall suckle their children for two whole years  for him who desires to complete the time of suckling . and their maintenance and their clothing must be borne by the father a  2311  if the husband is proved to give injury to the wife  he can not retain her  and she can claim a divorce . injury to the wife may be of a general nature or one given with the object of compelling her to remit her dowry to obtain a divorce . it is for the judge to see that the husband is not taking undue advantage of his position . on the other hand  the husband is enjoined to show liberality to the divorced wife  and the judge would no doubt see that the injunctions of the quran were observed . it is made clear in 435 that decision in matters of divorce rests with the judges appointed  not with the husband or the wife . b  2312  the injunctions relating to the kind treatment of women must not be taken lightly  we are told here . retaining women to cause them injury has already been declared to be a transgression and emphasis is now laid on the proper obser vance of these injunctions by stating that these are most serious matters relating to the welfare of society as a whole . c  232  as already stated  when a divorce is pronounced  the conjugal rela tions can be reestablished within the period of waiting . here it is stated that if the period of waiting has elapsed  even then the former husband can remarry the divorced wife . the decision to remarry is determined solely by mutual agreement between the former husband and wife  on terms of equality with one another . d  233  by mothers here are meant in particular  as the context shows  women who have been divorced having children to suckle . 2234  divorced women and widows 57 according to usage . no soul shall be burdened beyond its capacity . neither shall a mother be made to suffer harm on account of her child  nor a father on account of his child  and a similar duty  devolves  on the  father s  heir . but if both desire weaning by mutual consent and counsel  there is no blame on them . and if you wish to engage a wetnurse for your children  there is no blame on you so long as you pay what you promised according to usage . and keep your duty to allah and know that allah is seer of what you do . 234 and  as for  those of you who die and leave wives behind  such women should keep themselves in waiting for four months and ten days  a when they reach their term  there is no blame on you for what they do for themselves in a lawful manner .  and allah is aware of what you do . 235 and there is no blame on you concerning what you speak indirectly in the asking of  such  women in marriage or keep  the proposal  concealed within your minds . allah knows that you will have them in your minds  but do not give them a promise in secret unless you speak in a lawful manner . and do not confirm the marriage tie until the prescribed period reaches its end . and know that allah knows what is in your minds  so beware of him  and know that allah is forgiving  forbearing . section 3 1  provision for divorced women and widows 236 there is no blame on you if you divorce women while yet you have not touched them  nor appointed for them a portion . and provide for them  the wealthy according to his means and the restricted one according to his means  a provision according to usage .  this is  a duty on the doers of good . c 237 and if you divorce a  2341  the period of waiting in the case of a widow is four months and ten days . but in case a divorced woman or a widow is pregnant  the period of waiting is extended to the time of delivery  654  . b  2342  the meaning is that the widow may look out for a husband and remarry .  editor s note  the words  what they do for themselves in a lawful manner  place decisions about the widow s remarriage entirely in her hands .  c  236  the  portion  is the dowry due from the husband  so that even when 58 2 . the cow â€¢ 2  238 them before you have touched them and you have appointed for them a portion   pay  half of what you have appointed unless they forgo or he forgoes in whose hand is the marriage tie .  and it is nearer to dutifulness that you forgo . nor neglect the giving of free gifts between you . surely allah is seer of what you do . 238 guard the prayers and the most excellent prayer  and stand up truly obedient to allah . 239 but if you are in danger  say your prayers  on foot or on horseback . and when you are secure  remember allah as he has taught you what you did not know . 240 and those of you who die and leave wives behind  should make a bequest in favour of their wives of maintenance for a year without turning  them  out . c then if they themselves go away  there is no blame on you for what they do of lawful deeds con cerning themselves . and allah is mighty  wise . 241 and for divorced women  provision  must be made  in kindness . this is incumbent no dowry has been agreed upon  and marriage has not been consummated  libera lity must be shown to the divorced wife  and some provision should be made for her  even though the husband may be in difficult circumstances . a  237  the husband is the person in whose hand is the marriage tie . his forgoing his due is equivalent to not claiming the half of the dowry which he is entitled to by this verse . note that forgoing on the part of husbands is here stated to be the more commendable course . b  238  there are several opinions regarding what is meant by the term translated above as  the most excellent prayer  . most probably it does not refer to any particular prayer and means simply attending to prayer in the most excellent form . the guarding of prayers is not simply the observance of the outward form  it is both the form and the spirit to which attention is drawn . prayers are to be said at stated times and a particular method is to be observed  but this does not mean that the islamic prayer is devoid of spirit . the external form is needed to bring the inner faculty into exercise . as regards the spirit of prayer  attention is called to it again and again in the quran . elsewhere we are told   prayer keeps  one  away from indecency and evil   2945  . in fact  the quran condemns prayers which are devoid of spirit  10746  . c  240  what the widow obtains under this verse is in addition to the share of the deceased husband s property which she inherits under 41 1 . it is plainly stated in 412 that anything to be paid under a will shall have precedence of the division of the property into shares under that verse . d  241  this provision is in addition to the dowry which must be paid to 2242 fighting in the cause of truth 59 on those who have regard for duty . 242 allah thus makes clear to you his messages that you may understand . section 32  fighting in the cause of truth 243 have you not considered those who went forth from their homes  and they were thousands  for fear of death . then allah said to them  die . then he gave them life .  surely allah is gracious to people  but most people are not grateful . 244 and fight in the way of allah  and know that allah is hearing  knowing . 245 who is it that will offer to allah a goodly gift  so he multiplies it to him manifold  and allah receives and amplifies  e and to him you shall be returned . 246 have you not thought of the leaders of the children of israel after moses  when they said to a prophet of theirs  raise up for us a king  that we may fight in the way of allah . he said  may it not be that you will not fight if fighting is ordained for you  they said  and what reason have we that we should not fight in allah s way and we have indeed been deprived of our homes and our children  but when fighting was ordained for them  they them . just as in the previous verse the widow is given an additional benefit  here a provision in addition to her dowry is recommended for divorced woman . this shows how liberal are the injunctions of the quran regarding women . a  243  the thousands referred to are the israelites who left egypt with moses . they left egypt for fear of death  for death would surely have been their fate if they had not emigrated . the next incident in their history referred to here is the divine commandment to them to  die  . this is more fully stated in 52126 . moses told them to enter the holy land  which allah has ordained for you   but they refused and were made to wander about in the wilderness for forty years  so that that generation perished . this is also shown by their history as given in the old testament . it is also meant as a warning for muslims  who are told that if they followed the footsteps of the israelites  death must be their fate . b  244  see 2190  fighting in allah s way is equivalent to fighting in defence of faith . c  245  allah receives and amplifies means that allah receives the gift that is offered to him and then amplifies it  in other words  any sacrifice made in the cause of truth is amply rewarded by allah . d  246  the prophet alluded to is samuel . see 1 samuel 81920 . 60 2 . the cow â€¢ 2  247 turned back  except a few of them . and allah is knower of the wrongdoers . 247 and their prophet said to them  allah has raised saul to be a king over you . they said  how can he have kingdom over us while we have a greater right to kingdom than he  and he has not been granted abundance of wealth  he said  surely allah has chosen him above you  and has increased him abundantly in knowledge and physique . and allah grants his kingdom to whom he pleases . and allah is amplegiving  knowing . 248 and their prophet said to them  surely the sign of his kingdom is that there shall come to you the heart in which there is tranquillity from your lord and the best of what the followers of moses and the followers of aaron have left   the angels bearing it . surely in this there is a sign for you if you are believers . section 33  fighting in the cause of truth 249 so when saul set out with the forces  he said  surely allah will try you with a river . whoever drinks from it  he is not of me  and whoever does not taste it  he is surely of me  except he who takes a handful with his hand . but they drank of it except a few of them . so when he had crossed it  he and those who believed with him  they said  we have today no power against goliath and his forces . those who were sure that they would meet their lord said  how often has a small group overcome a numerous army by allah s permission  and allah is with the steadfast . 250 and when they went out against goliath and his forces  they said  our lord  pour out patience on us and make our steps firm a  2481  the word tabut means a chest or a box  but also signifies the heart . tranquillity from the lord is not a thing which is placed in boxes  but the heart is its real repository . on five other occasions the coming down of saklnah  or tranquillity  is mentioned in the quran  and every time it is the heart of the prophet or the faithful that is the recipient of it . the coming of  the heart in which there is tranquillity  means the change which came over saul when he was made king   so it was  when he had turned his back to go from samuel  that god gave him another heart   1 samuel 109  . the best of what the true followers of moses and aaron left are spiritual blessings  the highest being divine inspiration . b  2482  the meaning is that the tranquillity and inspiration were borne by the angels into the heart of saul . sa 2251  compulsion in religion forbidden 61 and help us against the disbelieving people . 251 so they put them to flight by allah s permission . and david killed goliath  and allah gave him kingdom and wisdom  and taught him of what he pleased . and if it were not for allah s repelling some people by others  the earth would certainly be in a state of disorder  but allah is full of grace to the worlds . 252 these are the messages of allah â€ ” we recite them to you with truth  and surely you are one of the messengers . 253 we have made some of these messengers to excel others .  among them are they to whom allah spoke  and some of them he exalted by  many  degrees of rank . and we gave clear arguments to jesus son of mary  and strengthened him with the holy spirit . and if allah had pleased  those after them would not have fought with one another after clear arguments had come to them  but they disagreed  so some of them believed and some of them denied . and if allah had pleased they would not have fought with one another  but allah does what he intends . section 34  compulsion in religion forbidden 254 o you who believe  spend  on good works  out of what we have given you before the day comes in which there is no bargaining  nor friendship  nor intercession . and the disbelievers â€ ” they are the wrongdoers . 255 allah â€ ” there is no god but he  the everliving  the self subsisting by whom all subsist . slumber does not overtake him  nor sleep . to him belongs whatever is in the heavens and what ever is in the earth . who is he that can intercede with him but by his permission  c he knows what is before them and what is a  2531  this also refers to the excellence of the prophet muhammad over all other prophets . b  2532  allah spoke to all  but there were some who were exalted above others by many degrees . c  2551  islam does not recognize the concept that man stands in need of any mediator to reconcile him with god  as in the sense of the christian doctrine . the prophet is the model for his people and in this sense he is called a shaft  or 62 2 . the cow â€¢ 2  256 behind them . and they encompass nothing of his knowledge except what he pleases . his knowledge extends over the heavens and the earth  and the preservation of them both does not tire him . and he is the most high  the great .  256 there is no compulsion in religion  â€ ” the right way is indeed clearly distinct from error . so whoever disbelieves in the devil and believes in allah  he indeed lays hold on the firmest handle which shall never break . and allah is hearing  knowing . 257 allah is the friend of those who believe â€ ” he brings them out of darkness into light . and those who disbelieve  their friends are the devils who take them out of light into darkness . they are the companions of the fire  in it they abide . section 35  how dead nations are raised to life 258 have you not thought of him who disputed with abraham about his lord  because allah had given him kingdom  c when abraham said  my lord is he who gives life and causes to die  he said  i give life and cause death . abraham said  surely allah causes an intercessor . those who take him for their model are not all equally gifted  nor have all equal occasion for spiritual progress  though they exert themselves to their utmost . so divine mercy takes them by the hand and amends are made for their shortcomings through the intercession of the prophet . it is in this sense that islam recognizes the doctrine of intercession in the life after death . a  2552  this is a very wellknown verse which goes under the name of ayat alkurst  or the verse of knowledge  because it deals with the allcomprehen sive knowledge of allah . b  256  to all the allegations that the holy prophet preached islam by the sword  this verse is a sufficient answer . being assured of success  muslims are told that when they hold power in their hands their guiding principle should be that there should be no compulsion in the matter of religion . the claim that this passage was directed only to the early converts and that it was abrogated later on is utterly baseless . c  2581  the words  because allah had given him kingdom  refer to abraham . this is corroborated by 454 . the muslims are here told that just as a promise is given to them that they will be raised to great eminence  which is equi valent to raising the dead to life  a similar promise was given to abraham  that promise being in fact the basis of the present promise to the prophet . d  2582  as the discussion arose out of the promise given to abraham that 2  259 â€¢ how dead nations are raised to life 63 the sun to rise from the east  so you make it rise from the west . a thus he who disbelieved was baffled . and allah does not guide the unjust people . 259 or like him who passed by a town  and it had fallen in upon its roofs . he said  when will allah give it life after its death  so allah caused him to die for a hundred years  then raised him . he said  how long have you remained  he said  i have remained a day  or part of a day . he said  no  you have remained a hundred years  but look at jour food and drink â€ ” years have not passed over it  and look at your donkey  that we may make you a sign to people . and look at the bones  how we set them together then clothe them with flesh . so when it became clear to him  he said  i know that allah is powerful over all things . 260 and when abraham said  my lord  show me how you give life to the dead  he said  do you not believe  he said  yes  but that my heart may be at ease . he said  then take four birds  then tame them to incline to you  then place on every mountain a part of them  then call them  they will come to you flying  and know that allah is mighty  wise . e his descendants would be made a great nation  it is clear that the reference here is to the life and death of nations . a  2583  the disputant belonged to a race of sunworshippers  and therefore if he could give life and cause death  he could control even his deity  the sun  and should be able to make it rise from the opposite direction . b  259  this refers to ezekiel s vision as related in ezekiel  ch . 37 . the town is jerusalem . the prophet dying for a hundred years is also an incident of the vision  standing symbolically for the death of the jewish nation or the desolation of jerusalem for almost a hundred years after jerusalem was taken by nebuchad nezzar in 599 b.c . the bones were a symbol of the fallen condition of the house of israel . the food and drink of the prophet not showing any influence of years  and his donkey still standing by  proves that the hundred years  death was only a vision . the vision made him a symbol of the whole jewish nation  and his symbo lic death for a hundred years represented the sorrows and afflictions of israel for a similar period  after which they were once more to be restored to life . c  260  this is a sequel to v. 258  which speaks of the manifestation of allah s power in the life and death of nations . in genesis 158 abraham is made to say  after receiving a promise of the land of canaan   lord god  whereby shall i know that i shall inherit it   the quranic parallel to this is   my lord  show me 64 2 . the cow â€¢ 2  261 section 36  spending money in the cause of truth 261 the parable of those who spend their wealth in the way of allah is as the parable of a grain growing seven ears  in every ear a hundred grains . a and allah multiplies  further  for whom he pleases . and allah is amplegiving  knowing . 262 those who spend their wealth in the way of allah  then do not follow up what they have spent with reproach or injury  their reward is with their lord  and they shall have no fear nor shall they grieve . 263 a kind word with forgiveness is better than charity followed by injury . and allah is selfsufficient  forbearing . 264 o you who believe  do not make your charity worthless by reproach and injury  like him who spends his wealth to be seen by people and does not believe in allah and the last day . c so his parable is as the parable of a smooth rock with earth upon it  then heavy rain falls upon it  so it leaves it bare  they are not able to gain anything of what they earn . and allah does not guide the disbelieving people . 265 and the parable of those who spend their how you give life to the dead .  he believed in the divine promise  but how would it be fulfilled  the answer to abraham s how as given in the quran is a perfectly intelligible parable . if he should take four birds and tame them  they would obey his call and fly to him even from distant mountains . the words  place a part  juz   of them  can only mean one each of the four birds . the story of cutting the birds into pieces  in connection with this verse  is not traceable to any reliable authority  nor do these words occur here .  editor s note  to revive a dead people with spiritual truth  from which they are running away like birds  they have to be tamed as one tames birds so that instead of being repelled away from the truth they are attracted towards it even from a great distance .  a  261  the expenditure of money must be accompanied with hard labour  as a seed cast on the ground unaccompanied by any labour would not grow . b  262  gifts  whether given in the cause of national or individual suffering  must not be accompanied by any interested motives  hence the donor is forbidden even to mention them afterwards . c  2641  this conveys a very strong disapproval of giving charity to be seen by people  making it utterly hateful in the sight of true believers . d  2642  the concluding words of the parable show that the efforts of the disbelievers to deal a deathblow to islam are meant here . they were spending their money to retard the advancement of islam  but their efforts would be fruitless . 2  266 â€¢ spending money in the cause of truth 65 wealth to seek allah s pleasure and for the strengthening of their souls is as the parable of a garden on elevated ground  upon which heavy rain falls  so it brings forth its fruit twofold  but if heavy rain does not fall on it  light rain  is sufficient  .  and allah is seer of what you do . 266 does one of you like to have a garden of palms and vines with streams flowing in it â€ ” he has in it all kinds of fruits â€ ” and old age has overtaken him and he has weak offspring  when a whirlwind with fire in it strikes it so it becomes blasted . thus allah makes the messages clear to you that you may reflect . section 37  spending in the cause of truth 267 o you who believe  spend  on good works  out of the good things that you earn and out of what we bring forth for you from the earth  and do not aim at the bad to spend from it  while you would not take it yourselves unless you turned a blind eye to it .  and know that allah is selfsufficient  praiseworthy . 268 the devil threatens you with poverty and commands you to be miserly  and allah promises you forgiveness from himself and abundance . and allah is amplegiving  knowing  269 he grants wisdom to whom he pleases . and whoever is granted wisdom  he indeed is given a great good . and none are mindful but those who have understanding . 270 and whatever you spend in charity or  whatever  vow you vow  allah surely knows it . and the wrongdoers shall have no helpers . 271 if you manifest charity  how excellent it is  and if you hide it and give it to the poor  it is good for you . c and it will do a  265  this is the parable of the believers who will reap the fruits of the sacrifices they make . b  267  muslims are here enjoined to support the cause of truth by spending good things  things which they love  and not to even think of giving bad things  things which they themselves would not accept from others . elsewhere it is said   you can not attain to righteousness unless you spend out of what you love   392  . c  271  the manifesting of charity or giving charity openly is quite different from giving  to be seen by people   for which see v. 264 . by the giving of charity 66 2 . the cow â€¢ 2  272 away with some of your evil deeds  and allah is aware of what you do . 272 their guidance is not jour duty  but allah guides whom he pleases . and whatever good thing you spend  it is to your good . and you do not spend but to seek allah s pleasure . and whatever good thing you spend  it will be paid back to you in full  and you will not be wronged .  273  charity is  for the poor who are confined in the way of allah  4 they can not go about in the land  the ignorant man thinks them to be rich on account of  their  abstaining  from begging  . fou can recognize them by their mark â€ ” they do not beg of people demandingly . c and whatever good thing you spend  surely allah is knower of it . section 38  usury prohibited 274 those who spend their wealth by night and day  privately and publicly  their reward is with their lord  and they have no fear  nor shall they grieve . 275 those who swallow usury can not arise except as he arises whom the devil prostrates by  his  touch . rf openly is meant the giving of subscriptions for the advancement of national or public welfare . the rule laid down here enjoins public as well as private acts of charity  mentioning public charity first  as that is of greatest importance . a  272  muslims did not fight to bring the disbelievers into the fold of islam  for that  the prophet is told here in plain words  was not his responsibility . it was for the good of their people  for their defence  that the muslims were required to raise subscriptions . hence what they spent was for allah s pleasure  because it was in the cause of truth . they are assured that for these deeds of sacrifice they will be fully rewarded . as regards private charity  muslim charity was exercised not only for the welfare of their own people but also for that of nonmuslims . islam did not allow difference of religion to be a hindrance in giving charity . b  2731   confined in the way of allah  included those who had to fight in defence of islam but had no means of livelihood  those who could not go forth to trade because of insecurity  and those who were wounded in the fighting . c  2732  those who abstain from begging deserve to be assisted by private acts of charity . d  2751  riba means an addition over and above the principal sum that is lent and includes usury as well as interest . just as charity is the broad basis of human sympathy  usury annihilates all sympathetic affection and leads to the 2  276 â€¢ usury prohibited 67 that is because they say  trading is only like usury . and allah has allowed trading and forbidden usury .  to whomsoever then the exhortation has come from his lord  and he refrains  he shall have what has already passed . and his affair is in the hands of allah . and whoever returns  to it  â€ ” these are the companions of the fire  in it they will abide . 276 auah will blot out usury  and he causes charity to prosper . and allah does not love any ungrateful sinner . 277 those who believe and do good deeds and keep up prayer and give the due charity â€ ” their reward is with their lord  and they have no fear  nor shall they grieve . 278 o you who believe  keep your duty to allah and relin quish what remains  due  from usury  if you are believers . 279 but if you do not  then be apprised of war from allah and his messenger and if you repent  then you shall have your capital . extreme of miserliness . islam refused to allow the rich to grow richer by reducing the poor to still greater poverty  which is the real aim of usury . usury causes man to be obsessed by love of wealth and selfishness  and this is  in fact  what is meant by the devil prostrating a devourer of usury . it may also be mentioned that while islam enjoins acts of sacrifice to carry on the struggle for national existence  it prohibits usurious dealings which are the basis of modern warfare . all wars are now carried on with the help of loans  interest on which ultimately is a source of ruin to both the conquerers and the conquered . a just war  a war in selfdefence  would always lead a community to acts of sacrifice to which they would be impelled in the interest of their own existence . a  2752  in trade the capitalist takes the risk of loss along with the hope of profit  but in lending money on usury the whole of the loss is suffered by the one who uses his labour  while the capitalist may count upon his profit even in the case of loss in the actual concern . hence trading is quite different from usury . b  276  usury is here condemned  while charitable deeds are commended as being the real source of the prosperity of a nation or of humanity in general . it is a prophetic reference to the general tendency in the growth of civilization to lessen ing rates of interest  so much so that usurious dealings  in the proper sense of the word  are becoming almost extinct  while the tendency for public charity or personal sacrifice in the interests of a community  or even humanity in general  is gaining ground . c  279  going directly against the commandments of allah is here described as a war with allah and his messenger . the money received as bank interest may be spent in the cause of allah and his messenger or for the propagation of islam . 68 2 . the cow â€¢ 2  280 wrong not  and you shall not be wronged . 280 and if  the debtor  is in difficulty  let there be postponement till  he is in  ease . and that you forgo it as charity is better for you  if only you knew . a 281 and guard yourselves against a day in which you will be returned to allah . then every soul will be paid in full what it has earned  and they will not be wronged . section 39  contracts and evidence 282 o you who believe  when you contract a debt for a fixed time  write it down . and let a scribe write it down between you with fairness  nor should the scribe refuse to write as allah has taught him  so let him write . and let him who owes the debt dictate  and he should observe his duty to allah  his lord  and not diminish anything from it . but if he who owes the debt is unsound in understanding or weak  or  if  he is not able to dictate himself  let his guardian dictate with fairness . e and call to witness from among your men two witnesses  but if there are not two men  then one man and two women from among those whom you choose to in fact the divine purpose in the prohibition of interest is fulfilled if interest is changed into charity . a  280  this indicates the kind of sympathy islam demands . the poor man is not to be prosecuted and thrown into prison  and payment of debt must be post poned till the debtor is able to pay  or  better still  the whole may be remitted as charity . b  2821  if islam enjoins charity and prohibits usury  it also requires that the greatest precautions must be taken for safeguarding property rights . the arabs were quite an illiterate people  among whom writing was very rare . even then they were required to put down all their transactions  great or small  in writing  except in handtohand dealings . c  2822  a guardian may be appointed for one who is not able to manage his own property because he is a minor or his understanding is not sound on account of age or any other reason . d  2823  as women did not take much part in business  and might be unfamiliar with the transaction  two women are required instead of one man .  editor s note  it is quite unwarranted to presume from this advice that the evi dence of two women equals the evidence of one man . according to 2469 if a husband accuses his wife of adultery which she denies and he is the sole witness  her testimony is treated as of equal value to his . in 5106 and 652 it is required to 2  283 â€¢ contracts and evidence 69 be witnesses  so that if one of the two commits error  the one may remind the other .  and the witnesses must not refuse when they are summoned . and do not be averse to writing it whether it is small or large along with the time of its falling due . this is more equitable in the sight of allah and makes testimony surer and the best way to keep away from doubts . but when it is ready mer chandise which you give and take among yourselves from hand to hand  there is no blame on you in not writing it down . and have witnesses when you sell to one another . and let no harm be done to the scribe or to the witnesses . and if you do  it   then surely it is a transgression on your part . and keep your duty to allah . and allah teaches you . and allah is knower of all things . 283 and if you are on a journey and you can not find a scribe  a security may be taken into possession. but if one of you trusts another  then he who is trusted should deliver his trust  and let him keep his duty to allah  his lord . and do not conceal testimony . and whoever conceals it  his heart is surely sinful . and allah is knower of what you do . have  two just ones  as witnesses and not specifically men . there are a number of reports in hadith showing that the holy prophet muhammad gave full weight to the testimony of a woman .  a  2824  the personal pronoun humd may refer either to the testimony of the two witnesses or the two women . reminding here stands for making up the deficiency of the other s memory . the holy quran does not say that no case should be decided except on the testimony of two witnesses  but requires ordinari ly the calling of two witnesses at the time of the transaction  so that the deficiency of one may be rectified by the other . cases may be decided on circumstantial evidence as well  which is sometimes stronger than the evidence of witnesses . the quran itself speaks of joseph s innocence being established on circumstantial evidence  122627  . b  2825  the scribe and the witnesses must not be made to suffer loss in their own business . in other words  their convenience must be kept in view  and they should be paid . c  283  this does not mean that a security can not be taken in any other case . security may be taken when the lender does not trust the debtor . also  advantage can be derived by the lender from the property which has been given into his possession as a security for the debt . 70 2 . the cow â€¢ 2  284 section 40  muslims shall be made victorious 284 to allah belongs whatever is in the heavens and what ever is in the earth . and whether you manifest what is in your minds or hide it  allah will call you to account according to it .  so he forgives whom he pleases and punishes whom he pleases . and allah is powerful over all things . 285 the messenger believes in what has been revealed to him from his lord  and  so do  the believers . they all believe in allah and his angels and his books and his messengers . we make no distinction between any of his messengers . and they say  we hear and obey  our lord  your forgiveness  do we crave   and to you is the eventual course . 286 allah does not impose on any soul a duty beyond its ability . to its benefit is what  good  it earns  and to its detriment is what  evil  it works . our lord  do not punish us if we forget or make a mistake . our lord  do not lay on us a burden as you did lay on those before us . our lord  do not impose on us  afflictions  which we have not the strength to bear . and pardon us  and grant us protection  and have mercy on us  you are our patron  so grant us victory over the disbelieving peopled a  284  this verse does not signify  allah will call you to account for it  but that he  will call you to account according to it   so that he who hides  i.e . keeps under control  his evil inclinations and he who manifests  i.e . gives vent to them  shall not be dealt with in the same manner  but according to their deserts . almost the same statement is contained in 329  where it is said   say  whether you hide what is in your hearts or manifest it  allah knows it  . evil thoughts are not unpunishable  but evil inclinations which a man keeps suppressed  and which therefore gradually disappear  can not be included in the category of evil thoughts  it is these that are meant here . b  285  the breadth of the muslim faith  which has been dealt with on several occasions in this chapter  is again mentioned in reference to the triumph of the muslims  for even if the muslims were triumphant  their religion could not triumph over other religions unless established on very broad principles which should commend themselves to all . the triumph of the muslim religion would be due to the excellence and breadth of its principles . hence  even in these days of muslim political decadence  islam is making spiritual conquests . c  286  see next page . 2284  muslims shall be made victorious 71 c  286  as a preliminary to the prayer for victory over the disbelieving people  there is one set of three petitions in the first part of the verse and another set of three petitions in the second part . the first three petitions made to god are do not punish us  do not lay on us the burden of sins  do not impose on us afflictions which we have not the strength to bear . corresponding to these three petitions respectively are the three petitions in the second part  pardon us  grant us protection  have mercy on us . thus corresponding to the desire to be saved from punishment is the petition that god may pardon his servant whatever faults he has committed  corresponding to the desire that one may not be burdened with sins is the petition that one may be granted protection from the commission of sins  and corresponding to the desire to be saved from afflictions which one has not the strength to bear is the petition for the mercy of god . it is noteworthy that if muslims are taught to pray for victory over dis believers  as here  they are at the same time taught to be humble and forgiving . chapter 3 ai immn the family of amran the name of this chapter is taken from the mention of imran in v. 33  who is amran of the bible  the father of moses and aaron . it deals with the depar ture of prophethood from the mosaic dispensation . it opens with a rule of interpretation for divine books  which is that any allegorical statement must be interpreted so as not to contradict the clear principles laid down by divine revelation . this is a preliminary to a discussion of christian doctrines  which are based on wrong interpretations of certain allegorical statements . the chapter then deals with  the last divine elect of the israelites  including jesus  after whom the spiritual kingdom was granted to the muslims  religious controversy with the jews and christians  and their opposition to islam  testi mony to the truth of islam in previous scriptures  the need for muslim unity  the need for muslims to show perseverance in suffering as in the battle of uhud  and how they will triumph in the end after their struggles . almost the entire chapter was revealed in 3 a.h . section 1  rule of interpretation in the name of allah  the beneficent  the merciful . 1 i  allah  am the best knower   2 allah   there is  no god but he  the everliving  the selfsubsisting  by whom all subsist . 3 he has revealed to you the book with truth verifying what is  already  before it  and he revealed the torah and the gospel a  1  for explanation  see 21 footnote . b  2  as this chapter controverts christian doctrines  it fittingly opens with two attributes of the divine being  the everliving and the selfsubsisting  which refute the doctrine of the divinity of jesus christ . the statement that there is no god but he contains an ideal expression of the religion of islam in four words . c  31   with truth  signifies that the quran was revealed suitably to the requirements of wisdom and justice  and to the exigencies of the case  in other words  it was revealed at a time when revelation was sorely needed by humanity . d  32  taurat is the name given to the books of moses  or the pentateuch  and hence its correct rendering is the hebrew word torah . the taurat does not signify the old testament  because the latter is the name of the whole collection 72 34â « rule of interpretation 73 4 before  a guidance for the people   and he sent the criterion . those who disbelieve in the messages of allah â€ ” for them is a severe punishment . and allah is mighty  the lord of retribution 5 surely nothing in the earth or in the heaven is hidden from allah . 6 he it is who shapes you in the wombs as he pleases . there is no god but he  the mighty  the wise . 7 he it is who has revealed the book to you  some of its verses are decisive â€ ” they are the basis of the book â€ ” and others are allegorical . then those in whose hearts is perversity follow the part of it which is allegorical  seeking to mislead  and seeking to give it  their own  interpretation . 6 and none knows its interpretation of the books of the israelite prophets . the word injil  gospel  does not signify the new testament but the revelation granted to jesus . a  41  the torah and the gospel were undoubtedly a guidance before the quran  but even as they now exist  they afford guidance in many respects with a mixture of error  and contain numerous prophecies fulfilled in the advent of prophet muhammad . b  42  see 253 and 2185 footnote 3 . the quran is here mentioned by the name furqdn or that which distinguishes between truth and falsehood  and pro vides a criterion  because it was sent to separate the truth in previous revelation from the falsehood which had found its way into it . as the furqdn  or the criterion of truth  in the case of the holy prophet was also provided by the battle of badr  this event is referred to in v. 13 as a prelude to the actual controversy . c  43  the word used here for retribution conveys the idea of avenging but not of revenge . d  71  the quran establishes certain principles in clear words which are to be taken as the basis  while there are statements made in allegorical words or sus ceptible to different meanings  the interpretation of which must be in consonance with the other parts and the spirit of the book . when a certain principle is laid down in unmistakable words  any statement carrying a doubtful significance  or one which is apparently opposed to that principle  must be interpreted subject to the principle enunciated . the subject is appropriately dealt with here as a prelude to a controversy with the christians  who attribute divinity to jesus on the basis of certain ambiguous words or allegorical statements  without heeding the funda mental principles established by the earlier prophets . e  72  these are people who do not care to seek the real interpretation which can only be found by referring to the principles laid down elsewhere but give an interpretation to an ambiguous verse alone  without considering it in conjunction with other similar verses or the principles laid down elsewhere . 74 3 . the family of amran â€¢ 3  8 except allah  and those firmly rooted in knowledge . they say  we believe in it  it is all from our lord .  and none are mindful except those who have understanding . 8 our lord  do not make our hearts to deviate after you have guided us and grant us mercy from yourself  surely you are the most liberal giver . 9 our lord  surely you are the gatherer of people on a day about which there is no doubt . surely allah will not fail in  his  promise . section 2  unity of god as basis of all religions 10 those who disbelieve  neither their wealth nor their child ren will avail them at all against allah . and they will be fuel for fire â€ ” n as was the case of the people of pharaoh  and those before them  they rejected our messages  so allah destroyed them on account of their sins . and allah is severe in retribution . 12 say to those who disbelieve  you will be defeated  and driven together to hell  and evil is the restingplace . 13 indeed there was a sign for you in the two armies  which  met together in encounter â€ ” one party fighting in the way of allah and the other dis believing  whom they saw twice as many as themselves with the sight of the eye . c and allah strengthens with his aid whom he pleases . there is surely a lesson in this for those who have eyes . a  73  the words it is all from our lord signify that there is no disagreement between the various portions of the holy book . hence the rule of interpretation which they follow is that they refer passages which are susceptible to various inter pretations to those whose meaning is obvious or to similar passages  and subject particular statements to general principles . b  12  this is one of the passages in which the punishment of this life  which is defeat  is spoken of in the same breath with the punishment of the hereafter  which is hell . c  13  the reference here is to the battle of badr . the actual strength of the two parties was  quraish about 1000  muslims 313 . the muslims saw the disbelievers to be twice as many as themselves  and therefore they appeared fewer in their eyes as compared with their actual numbers . the battle of badr is here stated to be a sign of the truth of the holy prophet  not only because of the pro phecies of victory contained in the quran  but also because of the clear prophecy in the bible in the book of isaiah  211317 . it speaks of future events in the land of arabia  which clearly came to pass in the emigration of the muslims to madinah and the defeat  one year later  of the army of the quraish . 314  unity of god as basis of all religions 75 14 the love of desires is made attractive to people â€ ” of women and sons and hoarded treasures of gold and silver and wellbred horses and cattle and crop produce . this is the provision of the life of this world . and allah â€ ” with him is the good goal  of life  . 15 say  shall i tell you of what is better than these  for those who guard against evil are gardens with their lord  in which rivers flow  to abide in them  and pure companions and allah s goodly pleasure .  and allah is seer of the servants . 16 those who say  our lord  we believe  so forgive our sins and save us from the punish ment of the fire . 17 the patient and the truthful and the obedient and those who spend  on good works  and those who ask divine protection in the morning times . 18 allah bears witness that there is no god but he  and  so do  the angels and those possessed of knowledge  maintaining justice . e there is no god but he  the mighty  the wise . 19 surely the  true  religion with allah is islam . and those who were given the book a  15  for the companions in paradise see 225 footnote 3 . among the blessings of paradise is allah s goodly pleasure  which is elsewhere said to be the greatest of all the blessings of paradise  972  . the addition of this word here shows that the blessings of paradise are spiritual . b  17  seeking of divine protection  istighfar  is really a prayer to attain to sinlessness . the righteous servants of god are here spoken of as possessing the great qualifications of steadfastness  truthfulness  obedience to god  spending in allah s way  and finally as resorting to istighfar or divine protection  which shows that it is one of the highest stages to which the spiritual pilgrim aspires . c  18  allah bears witness to his unity through nature  which is his handi work  and also by his word made known through revelation . the angels bear witness by their working within man  whose nature bears testimony to divine unity . those who have a true knowledge of the holy scriptures of any religion also bear testimony to the great truth of the unity of allah . the unity of allah is  in fact  the common principle which is recognized by all religions . the words maintaining justice most likely qualify those possessed of know ledge  the meaning being that every possessor of knowledge  to whatever religion he may belong  bears witness to the grand truth of divine unity if he maintains justice in bearing witness . d  19  the meaning is that the principle of submission to god  thereby enter ing into peace  has always been the true religion . according to the holy quran  islam was the religion of all the prophets . the israelite prophets who followed 76 3 . the family of amran â€¢ 3  20 differed only after knowledge had come to them  out of envy among themselves . and whoever disbelieves in the messages of allah â€ ” allah indeed is quick at reckoning . 20 but if they dispute with you say  i submit myself entirely to allah and  so does  he who follows me . and say to those who have been given the book and the unlearned  people    do you submit yourselves  if they submit  then indeed they follow the right way  and if they turn back  jour duty is only to deliver the message . and allah is seer of the servants . section 3  kingdom granted to another people 21 those who disbelieve in the messages of allah and would kill the prophets unjustly and kill those among people who command  the doing of  justice  announce to them a painful punishment . 22 those are they whose deeds will be fruitless in this world and the hereafter  and they will have no helpers . 23 have you not seen those who are given a portion of the book  they are invited to the book of allah that it may decide between them  then some of them turn back and they withdraw 24 this is because they say  the fire shall not touch us but for a few days  and what they forge deceives them regarding their religion . 25 then how will it be when we gather them together on a day about which there is no doubt . and every soul shall be fully paid what it has earned  and they shall not be wronged  26 say  o allah  owner of the kingdom  you give the king dom to whom you please  and take away the kingdom from whom moses are spoken of as the prophets who submitted themselves  to allah   544  . it is also the natural religion of man  as in 3030 it is described as being  the nature made by allah in which he has created mankind  . a  20  by the unlearned people are meant the arabs . b  231  the jews are spoken of as being given only a portion of the book  because much of it had already been lost . moreover  the torah was not a complete law . c  232  the reference here is to the broad principles of religion regarding which the jews and the christians differed . the book of allah is the holy quran which gave a decision in the differences between them . 3  27 â€¢ kingdom granted to another people 77 you please  and you exalt whom you please and degrade whom you please . in your hand is the good . surely you are powerful over all things . 27 you make the night to pass into the day and you make the day to pass into the night  and you bring forth the living from the dead and you bring forth the dead from the living  and you give sustenance to whom you please without measure .  28 the believers should not take the disbelievers as allies rather than believers . and whoever does this has no connection with allah â€ ” except that you guard yourselves against them  c guarding carefully . and allah cautions you against his retribu tion . and to allah is the eventual coming . 29 say  whether you hide what is in your hearts or manifest it  allah knows it . and he knows whatever is in the heavens and whatever is in the earth . and allah is powerful over all things . 30 on the day when every soul will find present whatever good it has done  and whatever evil it has done  it will wish that between it and that  evil  there were a long distance . and allah cautions you against his retribu tion . and allah is compassionate to the servants . a  27  verses 2627 refer to the fact that kingdom and honour shall be given now to another nation  whose night shall be made to pass into a day of triumph . the jews had already been warned by jesus that  the kingdom of god will be taken from you and given to a nation bearing the fruits of it   matthew  2143  . a living nation of muslims was brought forth from among the dead arabs  and the living nation of israelites was represented now by a people who were spiritually dead . b  281  the muslims  being in a state of war with the disbelievers  were forbidden to look to their enemies to guard their interests or for help of any kind . the clear statement made in 6089 settles the point beyond all doubt   allah does not forbid you  with regard to those who do not fight you for religion  nor drive you forth from your homes  that you show them kindness and deal with them justly . . . . allah forbids you only with regard to those who fight you for religion  and drive you forth from your homes and help  others  in your expulsion  that you make friends of them  . c  282  the meaning is  do not look to them for guarding your interests  rather guard yourselves against them . 78 3 . the family of amran â€¢ 3  3 1 section 4  last members of a chosen race 31 say  if you love allah  follow me  allah will love you  a and grant you protection from your sins . and allah is forgiving  merciful . 32 say  obey allah and the messenger  but if they turn back  allah surely does not love the disbelievers . 33 truly allah chose adam and noah and the descendants of abraham and the descendants of amran above the nations   34 offspring  one of the other . and allah is hearing  knowing . 35 when a woman of amran c said  my lord  i vow to you what is in my womb  to be devoted  to your service   so accept  it  from me  surely you  only you  are the hearing  the knowing . 36 so when she gave birth to it  she said  my lord  i have given birth to a female â€ ” and allah knew best what she had given birth to â€ ” and the male is not like the female  and i have named it mary  and i commend her and her offspring into your protection from the accursed devil . 6 a  31  the love of allah is the great goal of life to which islam leads . b  33  here begins the story of jesus christ  the central figure of the chris tian religion  and as a preliminary we are told that if jesus was chosen by god so were his great ancestors  adam and noah . the descendants of abraham and amran are then spoken of as having been chosen above the nations . for the choice of the descendants of abraham  see 2124 footnote . they are divided into two branches  the israelites and the ishmaelites . the former are here spoken of as the descendants of imran  who is the same as amran of the bible . the descen dants of amran are moses and aaron . moses became the founder of the israelite law and aaron the head of the israelite priesthood . the last of this race were john and jesus . their parents  zacharias and mary  are first spoken of here . c  35  imra at means a woman and also a wife . i take imra at imran as meaning a woman of the family of amran rather than wife of amran because the name of a great ancestor is frequently used to indicate the nation which has sprung from him . according to tradition  however  imran was the name of mary s father  and therefore the words imraat imran may mean the wife of amran . d  361  she had vowed the child to be devoted to the service of the temple  but a female could not do the priestly work . e  362  mary s mother while praying for mary prays also for her offspring  because  while dedicating her daughter to the temple  she entertained the hope that mary would eventually become a wife and mother . 337 birth of jesus and his ministry 79 37 so her lord accepted her with a goodly acceptance and made her grow up a goodly growing  and gave her into the charge of zacharias . whenever zacharias entered the sanctuary to  see  her  he found food with her . he said  mary  from where does this come to you  she said  it is from allah . surely allah gives to whom he pleases without measure .  38 there did zacharias pray to his lord . he said  my lord  grant me from yourself goodly offspring  surely you are the hearer of prayer . 39 so the angels called to him as he stood praying in the sanctuary  allah gives you the good news of john  verifying a word from allah  c and honourable and chaste and a prophet from among the good ones . 40 he said  my lord  how can i have a son when old age has already come upon me  and my wife is barren  he said  even thus does allah do what he pleases . 41 he said  my lord  appoint a sign for me . said he  four sign is that you do not speak to people for three days except by signs . and remember your lord much and glorify  him  in the evening and early morning . section 5  birth of jesus and his ministry 42 and when the angels said  o mary  surely allah has chosen you and purified you and chosen you above the women of the world . 43 mary  be obedient to your lord and humble yourself and bow down with those who bow . 44 this is among the tidings of things a  37  mary s reply  that she got sustenancerom allah  is the reply of every devout person who believes that allah is the sustainer of all  and that therefore all provision or sustenance comes from him . mary being attached to the temple  the worshippers would naturally bring gifts to her  and as it was through divine grace that she received these gifts she said that it was allah who gave her these things . b  391  the arabic word for john is yahya  this name indicating that he would not die in sin like his other relations . c  392  the promise given to zacharias was a word from allah  and john was the verifier of that word  because his birth brought about the fulfilment of the prophecy . a word from allah  therefore  stands for a divine prophecy  see also 634 and 1064. rf  43  after speaking of mary s birth and her growing up  the quran now speaks of her election just as the righteous before her were elected . evidently this refers to a time when she had grown up to the age of puberty and left the temple . 80 3 . the family of amran â€¢ 3  45 unseen which we reveal to you . and you were not with them when they cast their pens  to decide  which of them should have mary in his charge  and you were not with them when they con tended with one another .  45 when the angels said  o mary  surely allah gives you good news with a word from him  of one  whose name is the messiah  jesus  son of mary  c worthy of regard in this world and the hereafter  and one of those who are drawn near  to allah   46 and he will speak to the people when in the cradle and when of old age  and  he will be  one of the good ones . 47 she said  my lord  how can i have a son and man has not yet touched me  he said  even so  allah creates what he pleases . when he decrees a matter  he only says to it  be  and it is . e a  44  this verse can not refer back to mary s history as a child in the temple  as some think . the quran has described her history in the natural order  her con ception  v. 35   birth  v. 36   being dedicated to and residing in the temple  v. 37   and her election at the age of discretion  v. 42 and 43  . therefore this particular incident refers to her espousal . the casting of lots and the contention as to who should have her in his charge means her charge as a wife . b  451  the good news was given by means of a prophetic word from god . c  452  the quran makes no mention at all of mary s husband  but nor does it at all mention moses  father when relating the circumstances of moses  birth . the mere fact  therefore  that there is no mention of jesus  father is not sufficient to show that jesus had no father . moreover  of his two parents joseph and mary  mary was undoubtedly much more wellknown than joseph . d  46  speaking  when in the cradle and when of old age  can not be consi dered as miracles  as the latter is undoubtedly not . the good news conveyed con sists in the fact that the child announced will be a healthy child and shall not die in childhood . it would thus appear that  according to the holy quran  jesus did not die at thirtythree years of age  but lived to a sufficiently old age . e  47  she is told in reply to her question that the child will be born because god would bring about the circumstances which result in the birth of a child . the words do not show that she would conceive out of the ordinary course of nature  for there is no doubt that mary had other children  which no one supposes to have been conceived out of the ordinary course of nature . nor do the words that follow prove anything beyond the simple fact that mary must give birth to a son in accor dance with the prophecy . the whole of creation is brought about  we are told again and again  by the divine word  be   see 2117   yet no one supposes that creation is not brought about according to the laws of nature . 348 birth of jesus and his ministry 8 1 48 and he will teach him the book and the wisdom and the torah and the gospel  49 and  make him  a messenger to the child ren of israel  saying   i have come to you with a sign from your lord  that i determine for you out of dust the form of a bird  then i breathe into it and it becomes a bird with allah s permission  and i heal the blind and the leprous  and bring the dead to life e with allah s permission  and i inform you of what you should eat and what you should store in your houses . surely there is a sign in this for you  if you are believers . 50 and  i have come  verifying what is  already  before me of the torah  and i allow you part of what was forbidden to you  6 and i have come to you with a sign from your lord  so keep your duty to allah and obey me . 51 surely allah is my lord and your lord  so serve him . this is the right path . a  491  as jesus spoke in parables  this passage must be taken allegorically . what is meant is that jesus  by breathing a spirit into mortals  will make them rise above those who are bent low upon the earth  and the apostles of jesus  who were all men of humble origin  which is referred to in the word dust in the parable   left everything for the master s sake and went into the world by his command to preach the truth . here was mere dust having the form of a bird  which the messen ger of god converted into highsoaring birds by breathing truth into them . b  492  the quran gives an explanation of the healing of the sick when  speaking of itself  it says that it is  a healing for what is in the hearts   1057   i.e . for spiritual diseases . a prophet s healing is spiritual  not healing of physical dis eases . the quran speaks of the blind and the deaf frequently  but it never means those who do not possess the senses of seeing and hearing . c  493  the quran says plainly that those who die are not sent back to this world  see 3942 and 23100 . but the use of the word mauta  i.e . the dead  and of their being raised to life  is frequent in the quran in a spiritual sense   is he who was dead  then we raised him to life . . . like him whose likeness is that of one in darkness   6122  . and again   o you who believe  respond to allah and his messenger  when he calls you to that which gives you life   824  . the prophets are raised only for quickening to life those who are spiritually dead  and it is to this quickening through jesus that the quran refers here . d  494  jesus laid special stress on not having any care  for the morrow   and advised a rich man when he came to him to sell all he had . he would have them lay up treasures in heaven . the verse refers to this aspect of his teaching . e  50  the law of moses was upheld by the israelite prophets  but amended from time to time . these changes are particularly marked out in jesus  teaching . 82 3 . the family of amran â€¢ 3  52 52 but when jesus perceived disbelief on their part  he said  who will be my helpers in allah s way  the disciples said  we are allah s helpers  we believe in allah  and  ask you to  bear witness that we are submitting ones . 53 0ur lord  we believe in what you have revealed and we follow the messenger  so write us down with those who bear witness . 54 and  the jews  planned and allah  also  planned . and allah is the best of planners .  section 6  jesus cleared of false charges 55 when allah said  o jesus  i will cause you to die and exalt you in my presence c and clear you of those who disbelieve and make those who follow you above those who disbelieve to the day of resurrection . 6 then to me is your return  so i shall decide between you in that in which you differ .  56 then as to those who disbelieve  i shall punish them with severe punishment in this world a  54  the word makr used here is the equivalent of the word plan  the good or evil nature of the plan being dependent on the doer s intention . the jews plan ned to put jesus to death by crucifixion  and allah made a plan to frustrate their plans  and allah s plan was successful  i.e . he was saved from death on the cross  for which see 355 and 4  157. b  551  ibn abbas says that the words used here  mutawafjika  mean mumltuka  i.e . i will cause you to die  see bukhari  65.512  . these words are used to show that the jewish plans to cause jesus  death on the cross would be frustrated and that he would afterwards die a natural death  see 4157. c  552  the word raf signifies raising or elevating  and also exalting or making honourable . when the raf of a human being to allah is spoken of in the religious literature of islam  it is always in the sense of exaltation . the exaltation of jesus is mentioned here as a reply to the jews  whose object was to make him die an accursed and ignominious death on the cross . rf  553  this signifies clearing jesus of the false charges relating to the alleged illegitimacy of his birth  and so on  charges of which jesus was cleared by the quran . e  554  this is the fourth promise made to jesus in this verse  that those who follow jesus shall be made dominant over his rejectors till the day of judg ment . its truth is witnessed to this day in the dominance of the christians over the jews .   555  differences of belief are dealt with in the life after death  while the worst of transgressions in deeds are punished even in this life . 357 jesus cleared of false charges 83 and the hereafter  and they will have no helpers . 57 and as to those who believe and do good deeds  he will pay them fully their rewards . and allah does not love the unjust . 58 this we recite to you of the messages and the reminder full of wisdom . 59 the likeness of jesus with allah is truly as the likeness of adam . he created him from dust  then said to him  be  and he was .  60  this is  the truth from your lord  so do not be one of the disputers . whoever then disputes with you in this matter after the knowledge that has come to you  say  come  let us call our sons and your sons and our women and your women and our people and your people  then let us be earnest in prayer  and invoke the curse of allah on the liars . 62 surely this is the true account  and there is no god but allah . and allah  he surely is the mighty  the wise . 63 but if they turn away  then surely allah knows the mischiefmakers . section 7  controversy with jews and christians 64 say  o people of the book  come to an equitable word between us and you  that we shall serve none but allah and that we shall not set up any partner with him  and that some of us shall a  59  adam stands for man generally  because all human beings are created from dust  see 1837  225 and 3020  . all that is meant is that jesus is no more than a mortal  and that it is an error to take him for god . if adam is taken as a proper name  the meaning would be that just as adam was created from dust and then chosen by allah  so was jesus created from dust  and his election was similar to the election of adam  the command  be  referring to the election of a right eous servant of allah . in either case there is no reference to jesus being brought into existence without the agency of a male parent . b  61  the persons addressed in particular in this verse are the members of the christian deputation from najran that came in 10 a.h. to see the prophet muhammad . the deputation was lodged by the holy prophet in his mosque . thus did he set an unparalleled example of freedom of religious belief and practice . after the holy prophet gave them arguments showing that jesus was not god  and finding them still insisting on their false belief  they were invited as a last resort to pray earnestly that the curse of allah might overtake the party that insisted on falsehood . after some deliberation they decided against it and told the prophet that they had decided not to pray against him as suggested . thereupon they were given a pledge by which they were free to practise their religion . 84 3 . the family of amran â€¢ 3  65 not take others for lords besides allah . but if they turn away  then say  bear witness  we are muslims .  65 people of the book  why do you dispute about abraham  when the torah and the gospel were not revealed till after him  do you not understand  66 look  you are they who disputed about that of which you had know ledge  why then do you dispute about that of which you have no knowledge  and allah knows while you do not know .  67 abraham was not a jew nor a christian  but he was  an  upright  man   a muslim  and he was not of those who set up partners  with allah  . 68 the nearest of people to abraham are surely those who follow him and this prophet and those who believe . and allah is the friend of the believers . 69 some of the people of the book desire that they should lead you astray  and they lead astray only themselves  but they do not perceive . 70 o people of the book  why do you disbelieve in the messages of allah while you witness  their truth   71 people of the book  why do you mix the truth with falsehood  and hide the truth while you know  section 8  machinations to discredit islam 72 and a group of the people of the book say  affirm belief in what has been revealed to those who believe  in the first part of a  64  in this verse the jews and the christians are called upon to accept the broad principles of the faith of abraham  which were also the basic principles of the faith of islam . the words some of us shall not take others for lords is to the practice prevailing then both among jews and christians  and at present among muslims too  to treat religious leaders as if invested with divine powers . the basic doctrines of islam are the greatest common measure of the truth contained in different religions of the world . the doctrine of unity as taught by islam affords an illustration . all higher religions start on the basis of divine unity but then each religious system has its peculiarities unknown to all others . islam alone is free from all these additions to the basic doctrine  and it preaches unity in its simplest form . there are no idols  no gods  no incarnations of the divine being  no sons of god  and finally no priests or clerics to be followed blindly . b  66  the jews invited people to a belief in the torah and the christians to a belief in the gospel  but both these had lost the purity of the faith of abraham which was pure monotheism  unmixed with either jewish priesthood or christian doctrine of sonship . 3  73 â€¢ machinations to discredit islam 85 the day  and disbelieve in the latter part of it  perhaps they may turn back .  73 and do not believe except in him who follows your religion . say  true guidance â€ ” allah s guidance â€ ” is that one may be given the like of what you were given  or they would prevail on you in argument before your lord . e say  grace is surely in allah s hand . he gives it to whom he pleases . and allah is amplegiving  knowing . 74 he specially chooses for his mercy whom he pleases . and allah is the lord of mighty grace . 75 and among the people of the book is he who  if you entrust him with a heap of wealth  would pay it back to you  and among them is he who  if you entrust him with a dinar  would not pay it back to you  unless you kept on demanding it . this is because they say there is no blame on us in the matter of the unlearned people and they forge a lie against allah while they know . 6 76 no  whoever fulfils his promise and keeps his duty â€ ” then allah surely loves the dutiful . 77 those who take a small price for the covenant of allah and their own oaths â€ ” they have no portion in the hereafter  and allah will not speak to them  nor will a  72  this has two different significances . one is that they should affirm belief in the earlier part of the revelation  while denying the latter portion  as some modern critics do  thus creating doubts as to the sincerity of the prophet . the other is that they should affirm a belief in the truth of islam in the morning and deny it in the evening  creating the impression that the religion of islam was a false religion . the fact that a group of jews  in madinah under muslim rule  could conceive this plan is a clear proof that apostates in islam were not put to death . b  731  editor s note  this is the statement of the jews continued from v. 72  that they should not believe in any prophet who did not follow their religion . c  732  the contention of the jews not to believe in any prophet who did not follow the law of moses is met with the reply that a revelation must be given to another prophet like the revelation that had been given to moses  for the divine promise to moses was that god would raise up a prophet like him from among the  brethren  of the israelites  deuteronomy  1818  . in this argument the muslims are said to prevail over their opponents . d  74  allah s choosing for his mercy stands here for his choice of a prophet . e  75  they considered themselves free from all responsibility towards the arabs  despite any agreement they might have made with them . they are  how ever  told that god never allowed dishonesty against any people . 86 3 . the family of amran â€¢ 3  78 he look upon them on the day of resurrection  nor will he purify them  and for them is a painful punishment . 78 and certainly there are some of them who lie about the book that you may consider it to be  a part  of the book while it is not  a part  of the book  and they say  it is from allah  while it is not from allah  and they forge a lie against allah while they know . 79 it is not for a mortal that allah should give him the book and the judgment and the prophethood  then he should tell people  be my servants besides allah s  but  he would say   be worship pers of the lord because you teach the book and because you study  it   80 nor would he command you to take the angels and the prophets for lords .  would he command you to disbelieve after you submit  section 9  covenant of the prophets 81 and when allah made a covenant through the prophets  certainly what i have given you of book and wisdom â€ ” then a messenger comes to you verifying what is  already  with you  you shall believe in him  and you shall aid him . he said  do you affirm and accept my compact in this  matter   they said  we do affirm . he said  then bear witness  and i  too  am a bearer of wit ness with you . 82 whoever then turns back after this  these are the transgressors . 83 do they then seek other than allah s religion  and to him submits whoever is in the heavens and the earth  a  80  thus according to the quran no prophet â€ ” jesus included â€ ” ever taught his followers to take him as god . even the current gospels do not attribute any such teaching to jesus . the angels are mentioned because the pagan arabs worshipped the angels . b  81  the covenant was made through the prophets with their people . both moses and jesus specially laid an obligation on their people to accept the prophet about whom they prophesied  see  for instance  deuteronomy 1818 and john 1613  . in fact  all the prophets of the world foretold the advent of the prophet muhammad . the covenant was made through each prophet separately as he appeared in the world . and just as all the prophets foretold the advent of the prophet muhammad and laid an obligation upon their people to accept him  so the prophet muhammad also taught his followers to believe in all the prophets that had appeared among different people in different ages  and this is stated in v. 84 . 3  84 â€¢ covenant of the prophets 87 willingly or unwillingly  and to him they will be returned . 84 say  we believe in allah and  in  what is revealed to us  and  in  what was revealed to abraham and ishmael and isaac and jacob and the tribes  and  in  what was given to moses and jesus and to the prophets from their lord  we make no distinction between any of them  and to him we submit . 85 and whoever seeks a religion other than islam  it will not be accepted from him  and in the hereafter he will be one of the losers . 86 how shall allah guide a people who disbelieved after their believing  and  after  they had borne witness that the messenger was true  and clear arguments had come to them  and allah does not guide the unjust peopled 87 as for these  their reward is that on them is the curse of allah and the angels and of people  all together â€ ”   abiding in it . their punishment shall not be lightened  nor shall they be given respite â€ ” 89 except those who repent after that and amend  for surely allah is forgiving  merciful . 90 those who disbelieve after their believing  then increase in disbelief  their repentance is not accepted  and these are they that go astray . 91 those who disbelieve and die while they are disbelievers  the earth full of gold will not be accepted from anyone of them  though he should offer it as ransom . these it is for whom is a painful punish ment  and they shall have no helpers . a  83  compare 1315  2218  etc.  where it is said that all those who are in the heavens and the earth make submission to allah . the verse  in fact  shows that islam  or the rule of submission to divine law  is a law which is seen working throughout nature  and this is an argument of the truth of the religion of islam . b  85  the cosmopolitan nature of the religion of islam having been clearly set forth in the previous verse  it is now stated that anyone who refused to accept such principles would unfailingly lose in the end . a muslim accepts the whole truth  the truth as revealed to any prophet anywhere in the world  the truth as revealed to all mankind . c  86  the persons meant are those who believed in the former prophets and disbelieved in the holy prophet muhammad . having clear signs of the prophet s truth with them  and professing a belief in the prophets who had foretold the advent of the last of the prophets  they still disbelieved in him . 88 3 . the family of amran â€¢ 3  92 section 10  everliving testimony to truth of islam 92 you can not attain to righteousness unless you spend  on good works  out of what you love .  and what you spend  allah surely knows it . 93 a11 food was lawful to the children of israel  before the torah was revealed  except what israel forbade himself . say  bring the torah and read it  if you are truthful . 94 so who ever forges a lie against allah after this  these are the wrongdoers . 95 say  allah speaks the truth  so follow the religion of abraham  the upright one . and he was not one of those who set up partners  with allah  . 96 certainly the first house appointed for mankind is the one at bakkah  c blessed and a guidance for the nations . 97 in it are clear signs   it is  the place of abraham  and whoever enters it is safe  and pilgrimage to the house is a duty which people owe to allah â€ ” whoever can find a way to it . e and a  92  the connection with the last verse is clear . no wealth will buy redemption for a person if he has wasted his opportunity here  and to make the best of that opportunity a person must spend here what he loves most . b  93  the jews objected to the muslims making use of certain foods which the law of moses did not allow . an answer is given here that such foods were lawful for abraham and his descendants  and islam agreed in principle with the religion of abraham . by all food is meant all food made lawful for muslims . c  961  bakkah is the same as makkah  mecca  . the temple at jerusalem was erected long after abraham  while the holy house at makkah was there even before abraham  and was  in fact  the first house on earth for the worship of the divine being . d  962  the word mubarak  rendered as blessed  signifies the continuance forever of the blessings which a thing possesses . thus makkah is not only the first spiritual centre for mankind but also the ultimate spiritual centre for the whole of humanity . e  97  there are three signs or prophecies here with regard to the future of makkah . the first sign is that it is the place of abraham and hence the first prophecy is that the doctrine of the unity of god will be proclaimed to the whole world from this centre . the second sign is that makkah will always be secure  i.e.  it shall not fall into the hands of an enemy who should destroy it . thus its security is assured both physically and spiritually . the third prophecy is that a pilgrimage to the sacred house shall continue to be made forever  and no power in the world shall ever be able to put a stop to it . the most striking fact about these prophecies is that they were all announced at a time when the prophet and his followers had 3  98 â€¢ everliving testimony to truth of islam 89 whoever disbelieves  surely allah is above need of the worlds . 98 say  o people of the book  why do you disbelieve in the messages of allah  and allah is a witness of what you do .  say  o people of the book  why do you hinder those who believe from the way of allah  seeking  to make  it crooked  while you are witnesses  and allah is not heedless of what you do . 100 o you who believe  if you obey some of those who have been given the book  they will turn you back as disbelievers after your belief . 101 and how can you disbelieve while to you are recited the mess ages of allah  and among you is his messenger  and whoever holds fast to allah  he indeed is guided to a right path . section 1 1  muslims exhorted to remain united 102 o you who believe  keep your duty to allah  as it ought to be kept  and do not die except as muslims .  103 and hold fast by the covenant of allah all together and do not be disunited . and remember allah s favour to you when you were enemies  then he united your hearts so by his favour you became brethren . and you were on the brink of a pit of fire  then he saved you from it . e thus allah makes clear to you his messages that you may be guided . 104 and from among you there should be a community who invite apparently been driven away forever from the sacred place  when that place was in the exclusive possession of an enemy who did not allow the muslims to visit it  and when the small muslim community was in danger of being utterly destroyed by that powerful enemy at any moment . a  102  the muslims are exhorted  first to be individually conscious of the duty they owe to god  v. 1 02   and then to remain united in carrying the message of islam to the whole world  v. 103  . every muslim must live a life of true sub mission to god  so that when death comes to him it should find him a muslim . as v. 104 shows  the muslim s great duty  to which attention is called here  is the carrying of the message of islam to others . b  1031  by the covenant of allah is meant the quran  a significance sup ported by sayings of the holy prophet . all muslims  we are here told  should be united in holding fast to the quran and carrying its message to other people . c  1032  before the advent of the holy prophet  the arabs were in a state of continual internecine warfare which threatened to devastate the whole country . he brought about the impossible of uniting all these factions . 90 3 . the family of amran â€¢ 3  105 to good and enjoin the right and forbid the wrong . and these are they who are successful .  105 and do not be like those who became divided and disagreed after clear arguments had come to them . and for them is a grievous punishment . 106 on the day when  some  faces will brighten and  some  faces will darken . then as to those whose faces are darkened  did you disbelieve after your belief  so taste the punishment because you disbelieved . 107 and as to those whose faces are brightened  they shall be in allah s mercy . in it they shall abide . 108 these are the messages of allah which we recite to you with truth . and allah desires no injustice to  his  creatures . iâ° 9 and to allah belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is in the earth . and to allah are all affairs returned . section 12  relations of muslims with jews 110 you are the best nation raised up for mankind  you enjoin good and forbid evil and you believe in allah . and if the people of the book had believed  it would have been better for them . some of them are believers but most of them are transgressors . m they will not harm you except a slight hurt . and if they fight you  they will turn  their  backs to you . then they will not be helped . degradation will be their lot wherever they are found  a  104  this verse and 9122 both direct muslims to have always among them a missionary group  whose only object should be the propagation of islam and rightly directing their own people . this is the most neglected injunction of the quran in our day . muslims have arrangements for all other things but have no arrangements for inviting people to the great truth revealed in the quran . b  106  by faces brightening is meant their being expressive of joy  and by their darkening is meant their being expressive of regret .  editor s note  physical colour of skin  white or black  is not meant here  compare 1658   and when the birth of a daughter is announced to one of them  his face becomes dark  .  c  110  the excellence of the muslim people lies in their enjoining good and forbidding evil and in their great faith in allah . if they lose these characteristics  they lose their excellence as well . their excellence was no doubt due to the excellence of that great teacher who thoroughly purified them of the worst vices and made perfect the light within them . 3113  relations of muslims with jews 91 except under a covenant with allah and a covenant with people   and they shall incur the wrath of allah  and humiliation will be made to cling to them . this is because they disbelieved in the messages of allah and killed the prophets unjustly . this is because they disobeyed and exceeded the limits . 113 they are not all alike . of the people of the book some are upright â€ ” they recite allah s messages in the nighttime and they adore  him  . n4 they believe in allah and the last day  and they enjoin good and forbid evil and hasten in  doing  good deeds . and those are among the right eous . 115 and whatever good they do  they will not be denied it . and allah knows those who keep their duty . 116 those who disbelieve  neither their wealth nor their children will avail them at all against allah . and these are the companions of the fire  in it they abide . 117 the likeness of what they spend in the life of this world is as the likeness of wind in which is intense cold  it strikes the harvest of a people who are unjust to them selves and destroys it . and allah did not wrong them but they wronged themselves . n8 you who believe  do not take for intimate friends others than your own people  they spare no pains to cause you loss . c they love whatever distresses you . vehement hatred has already appeared from out of their mouths  and what their hearts conceal is greater still . indeed we have made the messages clear to you  if you understand . 119 look  you are the ones who will love them while they do not love you  and you believe in the book  a  112  the jews had already been subjected to disgrace before the appear ance of the prophet . but with the advent of islam they could better their condition either by accepting the covenant of allah  by which is meant the acceptance of islam  or by making a compact of security with such people as could give them protection . this remains true to this day . b  115  these verses speak of the good among the jews and the christians . the quran does not deny that there is good in others  its own eminence lying in the fact that it makes man attain the highest degree of perfection in goodness . thus the description of the upright among the followers of the book concludes with the words  whatever good they do  they will not be denied it . c  118  as the context shows  these people made war on the muslims and wished to cause them loss . hence muslims could not be friendly with them . d  119  this verse clearly indicates the difficulties which the muslims had in 92 3 . the family of amran â€¢ 3  120  in  the whole of it . and when they meet you they say  we believe  and when they are alone  they bite  their  finger tips in rage against you . say  die in your rage . surely allah is knower of what is in the hearts . 120 if good befalls you  it grieves them  and if an evil afflicts you  they rejoice at it . and if you are patient and keep your duty  their struggle will not injure you in any way . surely allah encompasses what they do . section 13  the battle of uhud 121 and when you went forth early in the morning from your family  to assign to the believers their positions for the battle . a and allah is hearing  knowing . 122 when two parties from among you thought of showing cowardice  and allah was the guardian of them both . and in allah should the believers trust . 123 and allah certainly helped you at badr when you were weak . so keep your duty to allah that you may give thanks . 124 when you said to the believers  is it not sufficient for you that your lord should help you with three thousand angels sent down   125 indeed  if you are steadfast and keep your duty  and establishing friendly and loving relations with nonmuslims . the muslims would offer friendship  but the other party was always on the lookout for some oppor tunity to inflict loss on them . a  121  much of the rest of this chapter is devoted to the events of the battle of uhud . in 3 a.h. the quraish marched against madinah . the prophet at first in tended to stay within the town  but afterwards marched into the open field with a thousand men  onethird of whom  under the leadership of abdullah ibn ubayy  the hypocrite leader  left him and returned to madinah . the enemy were first completely routed  but fifty muslim archers  who were placed in a strong position to cut off the retreat of the enemy  made a mistake  and in order to join in the pur suit left their position . the enemy fell back upon the muslims who were now in disorder and had lost their naturally fortified position  and after inflicting some loss upon them  left the field secure from the pursuit of the muslim force . it was not a victory for the quraish  who thought it safe to go back when they found the muslims involved in their own troubles . they could not take a single prisoner of war  nor had they the courage to attack madinah  which they did two years later with a very strong force . b  124  the promise of the coming of angels is fully explained in the 8th chapter in connection with the battle of badr . as here  it is first stated there that 3126  the battle of uhud 93 they come upon you in a headlong manner  your lord will assist you with five thousand of havocmaking angels .  126 and allah made it only as good news for you  and that your hearts might be at ease by it . and help comes only from allah  the mighty  the wise  127 that he may cut off a part of those who disbelieve or humble them so that they should return in failure . 128 you have no concern in the matter whether he turns to them  mercifully  or punishes them  surely they are wrongdoers 129 and to allah belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is in the earth . he forgives whom he pleases and punishes whom he pleases . and allah is forgiving  merciful . section 14  what success meant for muslims 130 o you who believe  do not devour usury  doubling and redoubling  and keep your duty to allah  that you may be success ful . 131 and guard yourselves against the fire which has been the promise was given only  as good news  and that your hearts might be at ease by it   810  . then it is made further clear there that the believers were strength ened and made firm while terror was cast into the hearts of their enemy . this was the result of the action of the angels upon the hearts . a  125  the assistance of the angels stated in this verse refers to a third occa sion  when the enemy came  in a headlong manner   all the tribes uniting with the quraish to crush the muslims . this happened in the battle of ahzab  or the allies  when the quraish  numbering about five thousand  with the help of allied forces  the total strength being more than ten thousand  suddenly attacked madinah . the dispersal of such a large army when the muslims were only about fourteen hund red was no doubt due to divine help  sent through angelic hosts . b  127  although the object of the disbelievers was to extirpate the muslims by war  god s aim was not to destroy all the disbelievers by defeat but to cut off their ringleaders and chiefs . the word translated as  a part   taraf  also means the leading men . when the leaders of mischief were cut off  the rest would be dis appointed of attaining the object of extirpating islam  and persecution would cease . c  128  as a mortal the prophet might have sometimes desired a severe punishment for his enemies  but he is told that it was not his concern  for allah might as well forgive them  even though they deserved punishment . the all comprehensiveness of the divine mercy expressed in this verse is unapproached in sacred literature . 94 3 . the family of amran â€¢ 3  132 prepared for the disbelievers .  132 and obey allah and the messen ger  that you may be shown mercy . 133 and hasten to forgiveness from your lord and a garden  as wide as the heavens and the earth  it is prepared for those who keep their duty  134 those who spend in ease as well as in adversity and those who restrain  their  anger and pardon people . and allah loves the doers of good  to others  . 135 and those who  when they commit an indecency or wrong their souls  remember allah and ask forgiveness for their sins . and who forgives sins but allah  and they do not persist knowingly in what they do . 136 their reward is protection from their lord  and gardens in which rivers flow  to abide in them . and excellent is the reward of the workers  137 indeed there have been examples before you  so travel in the earth and see what was the end of the deniers . i 38 this is a clear statement for mankind  and a guidance and an admonition to those who would keep their duty . 139 and do not be weakhearted  nor grieve  and you will have the upper hand if you are believers . 140 if a wound has afflicted you  a wound like it has also afflicted the  disbelieving  people . and we bring these days to people by turns  that allah may know e those who believe and  he may  take wit nesses from among you . and allah does not love the wrongdoers  141 and that he may purge those who believe and deprive the disbelievers of blessings . 142 do you think that you will enter the garden while allah has not yet known those from among you who strive hard  nor  known the steadfast  143 and certainly you desired death before you met it . so indeed you have seen it now as you look a  131  the fire in this case is excessive love of wealth . see chapter 104. b  134  restraining of anger  pardoning  and doing good to others  besides being great moral qualities  strengthen the bond of union which is so necessary for success . the verse has on many occasions inspired muslims with the noblest thoughts of toleration and charitableness . c  140  allah knows all that is seen or unseen . the knowing here and the not knowing in v. 142 refer to the knowledge of the event actually having taken place . d  143  this refers to the desire of those who insisted that they should meet the enemy in the open field  while the holy prophet s own desire was that the muslims should defend themselves within madinah . 3  144 â€¢ sufferings to be met with perseverance 95 section 15  sufferings to be met with perseverance 144 and muhammad is but a messenger â€ ” messengers have already passed away before him . if then he dies or is killed  will you turn back upon your heels   and he who turns back upon his heels will do no harm at all to allah . and allah will reward the grateful . 145 and no soul can die but with allah s permission â€ ” the term is fixed . and whoever desires the reward of this world  we give him of it  and whoever desires the reward of the hereafter  we give him of it . and we shall reward the grateful . 146 and how many a prophet has fought  with whom were many worshippers of the lord . so they did not lose heart on account of what befell them in allah s way  nor did they weaken  nor did they disgrace themselves . and allah loves the steadfast . 147 and their cry was only that they said  our lord  grant us pro tection from our sins and our extravagance in our affair  and make firm our feet and grant us victory over the disbelieving people . 148 so allah gave them the reward of the world and a good reward of the hereafter . and allah loves the doers of good  to others  . section 16  causes of misfortune in battle of uhud 149 o you who believe  if you obey those who disbelieve  they will make you turn back upon your heels  so you will turn back losers . 150 rather  allah is your patron  and he is the best of a  144  the prophet received severe wounds in the battle of uhud  there was even a rumour that he was killed . even if the prophet were killed  islam was so far superior to all forms of faith that the muslims could not give up islam . this verse served another important purpose at the death of the prophet . some of the companions thought that he was not dead . abu bakr went in  and seeing that life had departed  ascended the pulpit and read this verse  which had a magical effect upon his hearers  all of them being convinced that the prophet had passed away  as all prophets had passed away before him . the prophets were but mortals  and their span of mortal life must no doubt terminate like that of other mortals . this verse affords a conclusive proof that jesus was also dead  otherwise abu bakr s argument could not have silenced the doubters of the prophet s death . b  149  the war was carried on only with the object of making the muslims renounce their religion  and hence they could not think of accepting the disbelie vers as their rulers . 96 3 . the family of amran â€¢ 3  1 5 1 the helpers . 151 we will cast terror into the hearts of those who disbelieve a because they set up partners with allah for which he has sent down no authority  and their abode is the fire . and evil is the abode of the wrongdoers . 152 and allah certainly made good his promise to you when you slew them by his permission  until you became weakhearted and disputed about the affair and disobeyed after he had shown you what you loved . some of you desired this world  and some of you desired the hereafter . then he turned you away from them that he might try you  and he has indeed pardoned you . c and allah is gracious to the believers . 153 when you went away far  and paid no heed to anyone  and the messenger was calling you in your rear . so he gave you  another  grief for  your  first grief that you might not grieve at what escaped you  nor  at  what befell you . and allah is aware of what you do . a  151  the muslims were less than onefourth of their opponents  being at the same time not so well equipped as their foes  and in spite of the disorder into which the muslim forces had fallen  the enemy had to flee  leaving the muslims in the field  not even making a show of attacking madinah  which was quite defence less . this clearly shows that they were terrorstricken . b  1521  the weakheartedness of a part of the archers who were placed in an important position to cut off the enemy s retreat consisted in their disobeying the clear orders of the prophet   if you see us overcoming the enemy do not leave your position  and if you see the enemy overcoming us  do not leave your posi tion  . but they fell a prey to the love of the world and left their position to get a share in the booty when they saw the enemy fleeing before the muslim onrush . c  1522  the enemy  who was being pursued  turned against the pursuers on seeing the important position of the archers vacated  and the result was that the muslims who were now in disorder on account of the pursuit found themselves helpless against the enemy who turned back on them  and some of them who were cut off from the main body took to flight . however  god pardoned them as their flight was the result of circumstances which were beyond their control . d  153  it refers to the prophet s call  at whom the muslims now saw that the attack of the enemy was directed . so they did not grieve for losing an opportunity of pursuing the enemy  but for the dangerous position in which they saw the prophet . 3154  causes of misfortune in battle of uhud 97 154 then after grief he sent down security on you  slumber overcoming a group of you   while  there was  another group whom their own minds had made anxious â€ ” they entertained about allah thoughts of ignorance quite unjustly . they said  have we any hand in the affair  say  the affair is wholly  in the hands  of allah . they hide within themselves what they would not reveal to you . they say  if we had any hand in the affair  we would not have been slain here . c say  had you remained in your houses  those for whom slaughter was ordained would have gone forth to the places where they would be slain . and  this happened  that allah might test what was in your minds and that he might purge what was in your hearts . and allah is knower of what is in the minds . i s5 those of you who turned back on the day when the two armies met  only the devil sought to cause them to make a slip on account of some deeds they had done  and certainly allah has pardoned them . surely allah is forgiving  forbearing . 6 a  1541  this happened when the enemy departed . the slumber was a sign of security . b  1542  these were the disaffected who took no part in fighting . they now gave vent to their hidden rancour against the muslims . the evil thoughts which the hypocrites entertained about allah were that allah had not helped the muslims . c  1543  the hypocrites sided with the minority whose counsel was that the muslims should not fight the enemy in the open field and should remain besieged in madinah . the majority was  however  in favour of going out and meeting the enemy where it had encamped . the prophet decided that the majority vote must be accepted . the hypocrites now argued that the disaster would not have befallen the muslims if their advice as to remaining within the town had been accepted . they took no part in fighting but they spoke of the loss of the muslims as their own loss . d  1544  they are given the reply that even if the muslims had defended themselves by remaining in madinah  those who laid down their lives in the field of uhud would have laid them down in madinah as well . e  155  the persons spoken of here are those who were unable to join the main muslim army and fled to madinah  or in some other direction . it was a slip on their part  not intentional disobedience  and god granted them a free pardon . 3 . the family of amran â€¢ 3  156 section 17  battle of uhud afforded a distinction 156 o you who believe  do not be like those who disbelieve and say of their brethren when they travel in the earth or engage in fighting  if they had been with us  they would not have died  or been killed   that allah may make it a regret in their hearts . and allah gives life and causes death . and allah is seer of what you do . 157 and if you are killed in allah s way or you die  surely allah s protection and  his  mercy are better than what they amass . 158 and if you die or you are killed  to allah you are gathered . 159 thus it is by allah s mercy that you are gentle to them . and if you had been rough  hardhearted  they would certainly have dispersed from around you . b so pardon them and ask protec tion for them  and consult them in  important  matters but when you have determined  put jour trust in allah . surely allah loves those who trust  in him  . 160 if allah helps you  there is none that can overcome you  and if he forsakes you  who is there that can help you after him  and in allah should the believers put their trust . 161 and it is not for a prophet to act dishonestly . and who ever acts dishonestly will bring his dishonesty on the day of a  156  by  their brethren  are meant their relatives who were sincere in professing islam  and who had to lay down their lives in defence of their faith . b  1591  the quran calls attention to the prophet s gentle dealing with those around him when speaking of his experience in the field of battle as a general  a capacity which required him to be very strict in punishing any delinquency . he was the ablest general in leading his men  yet his gentle manners and his forbearance in dealing with his friends as well as foes stand in remarkable contrast with his capacity as a commander in the field of battle . after the uhud trouble he did not speak even a harsh word to those who were guilty of disobey ing his orders . c  1592  it was the majority decision to meet the enemy in the open field that had brought about the present trouble  but just at this juncture divine revela tion affirmed the principle of adhering to decision by counsel . d  1593  trusting in allah does not imply inaction . everything necessary is to be done . a course of action must be determined and then in pursuing that course trust must be placed in allah . the consequences must then be accepted . 3  1 62 â€¢ battle of uhud afforded a distinction 99 resurrection . then shall every soul be paid back fully what it has earned  and they will not be wronged . 162 is then he who follows the pleasure of allah like him who incurs allah s displeasure  and his abode is hell  and it is an evil destination . 163 there are grades with allah . and allah is seer of what they do . 164 certainly allah conferred a favour on the believers when he raised among them a messenger from among themselves  reci ting to them his messages and purifying them  and teaching them the book and the wisdom  although before that they were surely in manifest error . 165 what  when a misfortune befell you  and you had inflicted twice as much  you say  from where is this  say  it is from yourselves . surely allah is powerful over all things . 166 and what befell you on the day when the two armies met was by allah s permission  that he might know the believers  167 and that he might know the hypocrites . and it was said to them  come  fight in allah s way  or defend yourselves .  they said  if we knew fighting  we would have followed you . they were on that day nearer to disbelief than to belief  they say with their mouths what is not in their hearts . and allah best knows what they conceal . 168 those who said of their brethren whilst they  themselves  held back  if they had obeyed us  they would not have been killed . say  avert death from yourselves  if you are truthful . 169 and do not think of those who are killed in allah s way as dead . rather  they are alive being provided sustenance from their lord  170 rejoicing in what allah has given them out of his grace  and they rejoice for the sake of those who   being left  behind them  have not yet joined them  that they have no fear  nor shall they grieve . 171 they rejoice for allah s favour and  his  grace  and that allah does not waste the reward of the believers . a  167  the words show clearly that  in the language of the quran  fighting in allah s way carries the significance of fighting in selfdefence . 100 3 . the family of amran â€¢ 3  1 72 section 18  uhud no gain to the enemy 172 those who responded to the call of allah and the messen ger after the misfortune had befallen them â€ ” for such among them who do good and keep their duty is a great reward . 173 those to whom people said  surely men have gathered against you  so fear them  but this increased their faith  and they said  allah is sufficient for us and he is an excellent guardian . i 74 so they returned with favour from allah and  his  grace  no evil touched them  and they followed the pleasure of allah . and allah is the lord of mighty grace . 175 it is the devil who only frightens his friends  but do not fear them  and fear me  if you are believers . 176 and do not let those grieve you who run into disbelief hastily  surely they can do no harm to allah . allah does not intend to assign them any portion in the hereafter  and for them is a grievous punishment . 177 those who buy disbelief at the price of faith can do no harm to allah  and for them is a painful punish ment . 178 and those who disbelieve should not think that our grant ing them respite is good for themselves . we grant them respite only that they may add to their sins  and for them is a humiliating punishment . 179 allah will not leave the believers in the condition in which you are until he separates the evil from the good . nor is allah going to make you acquainted with the unseen  but allah chooses of his messengers whom he pleases . so believe in allah and his messengers . and if you believe and keep your duty  you will have a great reward . 180 and those who are miserly in spending what allah has granted them out of his grace should not think that it is good for them . rather  it is evil for them . they shall have a collar of their miserliness on their necks on the day of resurrection .  and allah s is the heritage of the heavens and the earth . and allah is aware of what you do . a  180  the same idea in more general terms  as to the effect of deeds being bound to the neck  is expressed in 1713 . every person carries the effect of his deeds with him in this life  but on the day of resurrection that effect will become clearly visible . 3181  carpings of the people of the book 1 1 section 19  carpings of the people of the book 181 allah has certainly heard the saying of those who said  allah is poor and we are rich . we shall record what they say  and their killing the prophets unjustly  and we shall say  taste the punishment of burning .  182 this is for what your own hands have sent ahead  and because allah is not in the least unjust to the ser vants . 183 those who say  allah has enjoined us that we should not believe in any messenger until he brings us an offering which is consumed by fire .  say  indeed messengers came to you before me with clear arguments and with what you demand . why then did you try to kill them  if you are truthful  e 184 but if they reject you  so indeed were rejected before you messengers who came with clear arguments and scriptures and the illuminating book . 185 every soul must taste of death . and you will be paid your reward fully only on the day of resurrection . then whoever is removed far from the fire and is made to enter the garden  he indeed attains the object . and the life of this world is nothing but a provision of vanities . 186 you will certainly be tried in your property and your persons . and you will certainly hear from those who have been given the book before you and from the idolaters much abuse . and if you are patient and keep your duty  surely this is an affair of great resolution . 187 and when allah took a covenant from a  181  the jews ridiculed the poverty of the muslims and their borrowings from the jewish moneylenders . they also ridiculed the raising of funds for the defence of the faith by subscriptions . see also 564. b  1831  they were referring to the burnt offerings of the mosaic law . c  1832  the critics are told that they even sought to kill those prophets who followed the mosaic law  who came  with what you demand  . d  186  this verse speaks of the future  in fact the distant future . the abuses which have been heaped on islam in the past two centuries are without a parallel in the whole history of religion . the scurrilous language of western publications  political as well as christian  and the vituperations of their imitators elsewhere have exceeded all moral bounds . but muslims are taught in this verse to bear all such abuse only with patience .  editor s note  hence it is not at all required or even allowed in islam that muslims should respond by killing or physically attacking 102 3 . the family of amran â€¢ 3  188 those who were given the book  you shall explain it to people and shall not hide it . but they threw it behind their backs and took a small price for it . and evil is what they buy . 188 do not think that those who exult in what they have done  and love to be praised for what they have not done â€ ” do not think them to be safe from the punishment  and for them is a painful punishment . 189 and allah s is the kingdom of the heavens and the earth . and allah is power ful over all things . section 20  ultimate triumph of the faithful 190 in the creation of the heavens and the earth and the alter nation of the night and the day  there are surely signs for those who have understanding  191 those who remember allah  standing and sitting and  lying  on their sides  and reflect on the creation of the heavens and the earth  our lord  you have not created this in vain  glory be to you  save us from the punishment of the fire . a 192 0ur lord  whomsoever you make enter the fire  him you indeed bring to disgrace . and there will be no helpers for the wrongdoers . 193 0ur lord  surely we have heard a crier calling to the faith  saying  believe in your lord . so we do believe . our lord  grant us protection from our sins and remove our evils and make us die with the righteous . 194 0ur lord  grant us what you have promised us by your messengers and do not disgrace us on the day of resurrection . surely you never fail in  your  promise  195 so their lord accepted their prayer   saying   i will not let the work of any worker among you to be lost  whether male or those who vilify islam and its holy prophet . see also 20130  3348  7310  4140 and 668 which lead to the same conclusion .  a  191  this chapter  like the one before it  ends with a prayer for the victory of faith over disbelief and a prediction for its ultimate triumph . verses 190191 describe true believers on the one hand as remembering god in the midst of all worldly pursuits  standing and sitting and lying on their sides  being thus fully conscious of the divine presence in all conditions  and  on the other  they set out for the conquest of nature with the full consciousness that nothing has been crea ted in vain and that a purpose underlies the whole of creation . this is the grand object which islam sets before its followers  to conquer self by remembrance of god and to conquer nature by pursuit of knowledge . 3  196 â€¢ ultimate triumph of the faithful 103 female  each of you is as the other . so those who fled and were driven forth from their homes and persecuted in my way and who fought and were slain   i shall truly remove their evil and make them enter gardens in which rivers flow â€ ” a reward from allah . and with allah is the best reward . 196 do not let control in the land  of those who disbelieve  deceive you . 197 a brief enjoyment  then their abode is hell . and evil is the restingplace . 198 but those who keep their duty to their lord  for them are gardens in which rivers flow  to abide therein  and entertainment from their lord . and what allah has in store for the righteous is best . 199 and among the people of the book are those who believe in allah and  in  what has been revealed to you and  in  what has been revealed to them  humbling themselves before allah â€ ” they do not take a small price for the messages of allah . these it is that have their reward with their lord . surely allah is swift to take account  200 o you who believe  be steadfast and try to excel in steadfastness and guard  the frontiers  . and keep your duty to allah that you may be successful . a  195  editor s note  this shows that muslims were first made to flee  were driven from their homes  and were persecuted for worshipping the one god  by their enemies  and it was then that they fought in battles in which they were slain . and they fought only after war was made upon them  see 223940  2  190. b  200  while victory is predicted for the muslims  they are required to be humble in the hour of triumph  as at the close of the last chapter . the three quali ties spoken of here  namely  steadfastness or endurance  trying to excel in stead fastness  and guarding  carry a temporal as well as a spiritual significance . they require  on the one hand  showing endurance in wars  excelling the enemy in endu rance and to remain in readiness on the frontiers of the muslim territory to meet the enemy  and  on the other  remaining steadfast in keeping away from evil and in keeping to obedience to god  trying to excel each other in the quality of endurance and to remain on guard against the temptations of the devil . chapter 4 ainisa  women this chapter deals chiefly with the rights of women . the battle of uhud  dealt with in the last chapter  had left a large number of orphans and widows among the muslims  and this chapter opens with the subject of duties towards them followed by rights of women generally . during the battle of uhud the hypocrites had deserted the muslims  and this chapter then deals with the subject of hypocrisy . following the battle of uhud had come the final rupture with the jews as they had sided with the enemy  and the chapter towards its end speaks of their transgressions against the israelite prophets and their allegations against jesus . this chapter was mainly revealed in 4 a.h . section 1  duties of guardians to orphans in the name of allah  the beneficent  the merciful . 1 o people  keep your duty to your lord  who created you from a single being and created its mate of the same  kind    and spread from these two many men and women .  and keep your duty to allah  by whom you demand one of another  your rights   and  to  the ties of relationship . surely allah is ever a watcher over you . a  11  how the first man was created is not stated either in the quran or in the hadith  nor is the bible statement accepted that eve was created from a rib of adam . muslims do not accept that man was created six thousand years ago . there are traditions stating that there were many adams  even hundreds of thousands of adams  before our adam . nor do muslims accept that our world is the only world in this universe  one imam is reported as saying that in god s universe there are twelve thousand systems each bigger than our solar system . the words  who created you from a single being and created its mate of the same  only declare the unity of the human race and the equality of the male and the female . elsewhere we are told that for all of you wives are created from yourselves  and allah has made wives for you from among yourselves   1672  . b  12   many men and women  spring from married pairs . the verse does not necessarily refer to any parent pair of the whole of mankind . it reminds people of the strength of the ties of relationship  an idea mentioned in what follows . 104 4  2 â€¢ duties of guardians to orphans 105 2 and give to orphans their property  and do not substitute worthless  things  for  their  good  ones   nor devour their pro perty  adding  to your own property . this is surely a great sin . a 3 and if you fear that you can not do justice to orphans  marry such women as seem good to you  two  or three  or four   but if you fear that you will not do justice  then  marry  only one or what your right hands possess . c this is more proper that you may not do injustice . 4 and give women their dowries as a free gift . but if they of themselves are pleased to give you a portion from it  consume it with enjoyment and pleasure a  2  the care of the orphan was one of the earliest injunctions that islam gave  and the prophet had always shown a deep anxiety for the welfare of the poor and the orphans  see 2220 and 901516 . the subject is here introduced in detail because of the number of orphans having been greatly increased by the war . b  31  this passage permits polygamy under certain circumstances  it does not prescribe it  nor even permit it unconditionally . this chapter was revealed to guide the muslims under the conditions which followed the battle of uhud  and the last chapter deals with that battle . now in that battle 70 men out of 700 muslims had been killed  and this had greatly decreased the number of males . the number was likely to diminish further still in the battles which had yet to be fought . thus many orphans would be left in the charge of widows  who would find it difficult to procure the necessary means of support . hence in the first verse of this chapter muslims are enjoined to respect ties of relationship . as they all came from a single ancestor  a breadth is introduced into the idea of relationship . in the second verse the care of orphans is particularly stressed . in the third verse we are told that if they could not do justice to the orphans  they might marry the widows  whose children would thus become their own children  and as the number of women was now much greater than the number of men  they were permitted to marry even two or three or four women . the holy prophet s own action in marrying widows corroborates this statement . marriage with orphan girls is also sanctioned in this passage  for there were the same difficulties in their case as in the case of widows  and the words are general . see also 4127 . it is not only the preponderance of females over males that necessitates polygamy in certain cases  but there is a variety of other circumstances  not only for the moral but also for the physical welfare of society . c  32  by what your right hands possess are meant the females who were taken prisoners in war . the quran sanctions marriage with them in this verse . as for the conditions of that marriage  see 425. d  4  it is obligatory in islam that a  dowry  or nuptial gift should be given by the husband to the wife at the time of marriage  whether she is a free woman  106 4 . women â « 45 5 and do not make over your property  which allah has made a  means of  support for you  a to the weak of understanding  and maintain them out of it  and clothe them and give them a good education . 6 and test the orphans until they reach the age of marriage then if you find in them maturity of intellect  make over to them their property  and do not consume it extravagantly and hastily against their growing up . and whoever is rich  let him abstain  and whoever is poor let him consume reasonably . and when you make over to them their property  call witnesses in their presence . and allah is enough as a reckoner . 7 for men is a share of what the parents and the near relatives leave  and for women a share of what the parents and the near an orphan girl  or a prisoner of war . so every woman begins her married life as the owner of some property  and thus marriage is the means of raising her status . the practice has  however  become more or less general to recognize dowry as a debt which the husband owes to the wife and which she can claim when she likes . a  51  by your property is meant the property of the orphans which is under your control as guardians . this verse requires guardianship in the case of all who are weak of understanding  whether minors or not . while on the one hand the quran lays stress on the transitoriness of this life  on the other it teaches that wealth is not a thing to be despised or wasted  because it is the means of support . b  52  the words  give them a good education  are generally rendered as meaning  speak to them good words   but the word qaul  speak  is used to express all kinds of deeds . after referring to the maintenance and clothing of the orphans in a befitting manner  the quran now calls attention to another great need of theirs which is education . from the first revelation  islam laid stress on know ledge  read and write  96  15  being its very first message  and the prophet spoke of the acquisition of knowledge as being as great a need of humanity as the acqui sition of wealth . it is the education of orphans that the quran refers to here  and the next verse which enjoins guardians to  test  their wards makes it clear . c  61  these words show further that the guardian is not only responsible for the education of the wards but he is also required to examine them and see what progress they have made . according to abu hanifah  majority is attained at eighteen years  but if maturity of intellect is not attained at eighteen  the limit may be extended . these words  moreover  show that marriage should be performed at an age after a person has attained majority  not before it  for the age of marriage is spoken of as being the age of attaining majority . d  62  these words allow payment of reasonable wages to the manager of a ward s estate out of the ward s property if the manager is not a rich man . 48â « law of inheritance 107 relatives leave  whether it is little or much â€ ” an appointed share.  8 and when relatives and the orphans and the needy are present at the division  give them out of it and speak to them kind words . and let those fear who  if they should leave behind them weakly offspring  would fear on their account  so let them observe their duty to allah and let them speak right words . 10 those who swallow the property of the orphans unjustly  they swallow only fire into their bellies . and they will burn in blazing fire . section 2  law of inheritance 11 allah commands you concerning your children  for the male is the equal of the portion of two females  but if there are more than two females  twothirds of what the deceased leaves is theirs  and if there is one  for her is the half . e and as for his parents  for each of them is the sixth of what he leaves  if he has a child  but if he has no child and  only  his two parents inherit him  for his mother is the third  but if he has brothers  for his mother is the sixth  after  payment of  a bequest he may have bequeathed or a debt . your parents and your children  you do not know which of them is the nearer to you in benefit . this is an ordinance from allah . surely allah is ever knowing  wise . a  7  among the arabs  women and children had no share in inheritance . islam introduced a great reform . the principle laid down here is the basis of the muslim law of inheritance . children and near relatives  or failing these  distant relatives  whether males or females  are the lawful heirs  and the whole of the pro perty does not go to the eldest son . this is in accordance with the broad principles of democracy and the brotherhood of man which islam seeks to establish . b  8  that is  distant relatives who for any reason are not entitled to inherit . c  111  by females are here meant the female children . when daughters are the sole heirs they are entitled to a share of twothirds of the inheritance if there are two or more of them  the words  more than two  include the case of two daughters  . if there is only one daughter she is entitled to a half . d  112  the parents first take their respective shares  and the residue goes to the children  if there are any  failing which  the share of the parents is increased . but in case the deceased has brothers  the mother receives the same share as she would have received if the deceased had children . in all cases the payment of bequests and debts takes precedence of the shares of the heirs . 108 4 . women â « 412 12 and yours is half of what your wives leave if they have no child  but if they have a child  your share is a fourth of what they leave after  payment of  any bequest they may have bequeathed or a debt  and theirs is the fourth of what you leave if you have no child  but if you have a child  their share is the eighth of what you leave after  payment of  a bequest you may have bequeathed or a debt .  and if a man or a woman  having no children  leaves pro perty to be inherited and he  or she  has a brother or a sister  then for each of them is the sixth  but if they are more than that  they shall be sharers in the third after  payment of  a bequest that may have been bequeathed or a debt not injuring  others  . e this is an ordinance from allah  and allah is knowing  forbearing . 13 these are allah s limits . and whoever obeys allah and his messenger  he will admit him to gardens in which rivers flow  to abide in them . and this is the mighty achievement . 14 and whoever disobeys allah and his messenger and goes beyond his limits  he will make him enter fire to abide in it  and for him is a humiliating punishment . section 3  treatment of women 15 and as for those of your women who are guilty of an indecency  call to witness against them four  witnesses  from among you  so if they bear witness  confine them to the houses until death takes them away or allah opens a way for them .  a  121  the husband or the wife  and surviving parents  take their fixed shares first  and the residue goes to the children . the twothirds share for two or more daughters can only be given when there are neither parents  nor husband or wife  otherwise they take the residue  as in the case of sons or sons and daughters . b  122  this is the case where the deceased has no children but has parents  and therefore the brothers and sisters are not the only heirs and their share is only onesixth . see 4176 for one who leaves neither children nor parents  and there fore the brothers and the sisters take the whole of the inheritance . c  123  the words not injuring others mean that debts and bequests shall not prejudice the rights of the legal heirs . d  15  the word  indecency  here signifies immoral conduct short of illicit sexual intercourse  the punishment for which is given in 242 . women guilty of 4  16 â€¢ treatment of women 109 16 and as for the two of you who are guilty of it  give them both a slight punishment  then if they repent and amend  turn aside from them . a surely allah is ever oftreturning  to mercy   the merciful . 17 repentance with allah is only for those who do evil in ignorance  then turn  to allah  soon  so these it is to whom allah turns  mercifully  . and allah is ever knowing  wise . 18 and repent ance is not for those who go on doing evil deeds  until when death comes to one of them  he says  now i repent  nor  for  those who die while they are disbelievers . for such we have prepared a pain ful punishment . 19 o you who believe  it is not lawful for you to take women as heritage against  their  will . c nor should you cause them hard ship by taking part of what you have given them  unless they are guilty of manifest indecency . and treat them kindly . then if you immoral conduct are curtailed of their liberty . if they mend their ways  or being unmarried they get married  a way is opened for them by allah  and they regain their liberty . a  16  the crime spoken of in this verse is the same as that in the previous verse . the committers are two  and though the masculine gender is used  it does not imply that they are both necessarily males . slight punishment has been ex plained as meaning reproving with the tongue . b  18  repentance  according to the quran  implies an actual change in the course of one s life  not the mere utterance of words . in fact  the law stated here shows how repentance does away with sins . when the very course of a person s life is changed in respect of a particular sin  the tendency to that sin is uprooted . but those who continue doing evil until death can not obtain the benefit of repent ance  because there is no time left for them to improve themselves . c  191  among the preislamic arabs  when a man died his elder son or other relations had a right to possess his widow or widows  marrying them them selves if they wished  without settling a dowry on them  marrying them to others  or prohibiting them from marriage altogether . this is abolished by these words . d  192  this passage remedies another evil . some husbands who were dis satisfied with their wives gave them trouble in order to force them to claim a divorce and remit the dowry  i.e.  the legallydue nuptial gift from the husband to the wife  . this is disallowed . if the judge finds that the fault lies actually with the husband  he will not allow the dowry to be remitted in his favour . it can only be taken back if the woman is guilty of immoral conduct . in such cases  when the fault is with the woman  she may be required to return it wholly or in part . 110 4 . women â « 420 hate them  it may be that you dislike a thing while allah has placed abundant good in it . 20 and if you wish to have  one  wife in the place of another and you have given one of them a heap of gold  take nothing from it . would you take it by slandering  her  and  doing her  manifest wrong  a 2 iand how can you take it when you have been intimate with each other and they have taken from you a strong covenant  22 and do not marry women whom your fathers married  except what has already passed . this surely is indecent and hate ful  and it is an evil way . section 4  what women may be taken in marriage 23 forbidden to you are your mothers  and your daughters  and your sisters  and your paternal aunts  and your maternal aunts  and brother s daughters and sister s daughters  and your mothers that have suckled you  and your fostersisters  and mothers of your wives  and your stepdaughters who are in your guardianship  born  of your wives with whom you have had sexual relations â€ ” but if you have not had sexual relations with them  there is no blame on you â€ ” and the wives of your sons who are of your own loins  and that you should have two sisters together  except what has already passed . surely allah is ever forgiving  merciful  24 and all married women except those whom your right â « â– hands possess  are forbidden   c  this is  allah s ordinance to you . a  20  another social evil was that a husband  wanting to marry another woman instead  would accuse his wife of adultery or other gross immorality  thus compelling her to obtain a divorce by paying a large sum of money . b  21  marriage is here called a covenant or agreement between the husband and the wife . as there can be no agreement unless both parties give their consent to it  marriage in islam can only be entered into with the free consent of the hus band and wife . c  241  it is thus forbidden to a man to marry a woman who is already married . an exception is made  however  regarding those whom your right hands possess . this expression may here mean those whom you have lawfully taken in marriage  and the meaning would be that all free women are prohibited to you except those whom you have lawfully married . generally by this expression in the â–º0 85 4  25 â€¢ what women may be taken in marriage 1 1 1 and lawful for you are  all women  besides those  provided that you seek  them  with your property  taking  them  in marriage  not committing fornication . then as to those whom you profit by  by marrying   give them their dowries as appointed . and there is no blame on you about what you mutually agree after what is appoin ted  of dowry  .  surely allah is ever knowing  wise . 25 and whoever among you can not afford to marry free believing women   let him marry  such of your believing maidens as your right hands possess . and allah knows best your faith â€ ” you are  sprung  the one from the other . so marry them with the permission of their masters  and give them their dowries justly  they being chaste  not fornicating  nor taking lovers in secret  then if they are guilty of adultery when they are taken in marriage  they shall suffer half the punishment for free married women . this is for him among you who fears falling into evil . and that you abstain is better for you . and allah is forgiving  merciful . section 5  women s rights over their earnings 26 allah desires to explain to you  and to guide you into the ways of those before you  and to turn to you  mercifully  . and allah is knowing  wise . 27 and allah desires to turn to you  mercifully  . and those who follow  their  lusts desire that you should deviate  with  a great deviation . 28 allah desires to make quran are meant those who are taken prisoners in war . it sometimes happened that such prisoners became converts to islam  and therefore they could not be sent back . such women it was lawful to take in marriage  even though they might not have been divorced formally by their former husbands . a  242  the husband and the wife are free to increase or decrease the amount of dowry fixed at the time of marriage by agreement among themselves . b  25  there is no verse in the quran or any instance in the holy prophet s life sanctioning what is called concubinage . whenever the establishment of con jugal relations with slavegirls or women prisoners of war is mentioned  their taking in marriage is clearly laid down as a condition as in v. 3  v. 24  and this verse . here marriage with such women is allowed under the following conditions   1  they should be muslims   2  a man has not the means to marry a free woman  and  3  he fears to fall into evil . 112 4 . women â « 429 light your burdens  and man is created weak .  29 o you who believe  do not swallow up your property among yourselves by false means except that it be trading by your mutual consent . and do not kill your peopled surely allah is ever merci ful to you . 30 and whoever does this aggressively and unjustly  we shall soon cast him into fire . and this is ever easy for allah . 31 if you shun the great things which you are forbidden  we shall do away with your evil  inclinations  and make you enter an honourable place of entering . 32 and do not hanker after what allah has given some of you above others . for men is the benefit of what they earn . and for women is the benefit of what they earn . and ask allah of his grace . surely allah is ever knower of all things . 33 and to everyone we have appointed heirs of whatever parents and near relatives leave . and as to those with whom your right hands have ratified agree ments  give them their due . surely allah is ever witness over all things . e a  28  in islam all principles of right action are stated with such complete ness  devoid of unnecessary details  that the real burden of man is much lighter than in any other religion . it  moreover  points out the right way for man s free dom from the bondage of sin  and thus reduces his burden by saving him from falling into evil ways . man being  created weak  refers to allah s great mercy in having shown him the truth and guidance  because he could not chalk out a way for himself which was free from error . b  291  all illegal methods of acquiring property are forbidden . only the seeking of gain from one another by trading by mutual consent is allowed . the passage is particularly directed to guard women s right to property  because it was women s and orphans  property that was generally swallowed up unjustly . c  292  this forbids the killing of anfusakum  which means your people or yourselves . in the first case  the significance is that life must also be protected  in the second case  it is an injunction against suicide which according to the law of islam is a grave sin .  editor s note  this injunction also forbids sending  your people  on suicide missions to their certain death .  rf  31  if a person avoids committing sins  the evil inclinations within him die also . division of sins into kabira  major  and saghira  minor  is baseless . e  33  in preislamic days  people entered into covenants with one another  by which they undertook to defend and inherit one another . such inheritance was abolished by this verse  and the words give them their due mean the rendering of assistance in general . 434  disagreement between husband and wife 1 1 3 section 6  disagreement between husband and wife 34 men are the maintainers of women  with what allah has given some of them above others and with what they spend out of their wealth . so the good women are obedient  to allah    guard ing the unseen as allah has guarded . and  as to  those on whose part you fear desertion  admonish them  and leave them alone in the beds e and turn them away  from wrongdoing  . so if they obey a  341  obedience here signifies obedience to allah . this significance of the word is made clear by a comparison with 3331  3335  and 665. b  342  this refers to their guarding the husband s rights . the two qualifi cations of a good wife as given here are her obedience to god and chastity . c  343  the word translated here as desertion  when used about a woman in connection with her husband  means her rising against her husband . this is ex plained by the commentators in a number of ways  for example  her leaving the husband s place and taking up an abode which he does not like or that the wife resisted her husband and hated him and deserted him . the remedy for her correc tion is that she is to be admonished  but if she persists in the wrong course  her bed is to be separated  i.e . a cessation of sexual relations . rf  344  editor s note  the words translated as  turn them away  use the term darb  and have often been translated as  beat them  . maulana muhammad ali rendered them as  chastise them  and explained that very slight chastisement was allowed only in extreme cases  which should not leave an impression  and further that this permission is meant only for the crass type of people in society among whom such chastisement is acceptable . however  as he pointed out in his footnotes on verses 260 and 273  the verb darb signifies  all kinds of actions except a few   and apart from striking it is used to mean  for example  marching on  setting forth a parable  and likening . in these other senses it is commonly used in the quran . it is used in 435 as meaning to turn  something  away   shall we then turn away the reminder from you ...    which is how maulana muhammad ali and many other translators have rendered this verse . this sense seems to be applicable here . thus the meaning here would be that by admonishing and  if necessary  breaking off sexual relations  the husband should turn the wife away from her wrong course  or it may mean that if these measures fail he should turn her away from himself  i.e . divorce her . it may be added that the quran clearly forbids a man from causing injury to his wife . in its rules for divorce  husbands are told about their wives   retain them with kindness or let them go with kind ness and do not retain them for injury   223 1    retain them with kindness or part from them with kindness ... do not injure them in order to impose hardship upon them   652  6  . in fact  only a few verses prior to v. 34 above  in v. 19  husbands have been instructed as follows about their wives   nor should you cause them 114 4 . women â « 435 you  do not seek a way against them . surely allah is ever exalted  great . 35 and if you fear a breach between the two  appoint an arbiter from his people and an arbiter from her people . if they both desire agreement  allah will effect harmony between them . surely allah is ever knowing  aware .  36 and serve allah  and do not set up any partner with him  and be good to the parents and to the near of kin and the orphans and the needy and the neighbour of  your  kin and the alien neigh bour  and the companion in a journey and the traveller and those whom your right hands possess . e surely allah does not love such as are proud  boastful  3 7who are miserly and tell people to be miserly and hide what allah has given them out of his grace . and we have prepared for the disbelievers a humiliating punishment hardship . . . and treat them kindly . then if you hate them  it may be that you dislike a thing while allah has placed abundant good in it  . a  35  this verse lays down the procedure for divorce . it is not for the husband to put away his wife  it is the business of the judge to decide the case . he is required to appoint two arbiters  one belonging to the wife s family and the other to the husband s . these two arbiters will find out the facts  but their objec tive must be to effect a reconciliation between the parties . if all hopes of recon ciliation fail  a divorce is allowed  but the final decision for divorce rests with the judge who is legally entitled to pronounce a divorce . cases were decided in accor dance with these directions in the early days of islam . b  361  the neighbour of kin may mean a neighbour who is a relative or a muslim neighbour  and the alien neighbour is either a neighbour not related or a neighbour of an alien religion . thus the charity of islam is not limited to one s own people or one s own coreligionists  but is extended to others also .  editor s note  the companion in a journey or the traveller  mentioned after neighbours  could belong to any people or any religion . indeed  the parents  near of kin  orphans and needy mentioned at the beginning could also be nonmuslims and it would be a muslim s duty to do good to them regardless of their religion .  c  362  by those whom your right hands possess are meant all those with whose care you are entrusted  so that it includes even animals over which one has control . while dealing with the rights of women  the quran generalizes the law of doing good to others  so much so that it requires goodness to be extended even to a fellowtraveller . if even companions whose company is so shortlived are to be treated generously  how generous must a man be to her who is the companion of his whole life  438 purification of the soul 1 1 5 â€ ” 3s and those who spend their wealth to be seen by people and do not believe in allah nor in the last day . and as for him whose companion is the devil  an evil companion is he  39 and what  harm  would it do them if they believe in allah and the last day and spend  on good works  out of what allah has given them  and allah is ever knower of them . 40 surely allah does not wrong  anyone even by  the weight of an atom  and if it is a good deed  he multiplies it and gives from himself a great reward . a 41 but how will it be when we bring from every people a witness and bring you as a witness against these  42 0n that day will those who disbelieved and disobeyed the messenger desire that the earth were levelled with them . and they can hide no fact from allah . section 7  purification of the soul 43 o you who believe  do not go near prayer when you are intoxicated till you know what you say  c nor after sexual inter course â€ ” except you are merely passing by â€ ” until you have bathed . and if you are sick  or on a journey  or one of you has a  40  such is the everrecurring description of the preponderance of mercy in divine nature  good done is always multiplied and evil nullified by god . b  41  the prophet sent to a people is frequently spoken of as being a wit ness in respect of them  and by these are here meant the followers of the holy prophet muhammad . it appears that the people spoken of here are muslims who disobey the prophet  and hence the prophet s anxiety for the later generations of his followers . this is made clear in the verse that follows in the words those who disbelieved and disobeyed the messenger . disobedience amounts to disbelief in practice . c  431  the prohibition against praying when intoxicated was a step towards the total prohibition of drink  for the necessity of going to prayer five times a day would leave little opportunity for indulgence in drink . the verse also makes it clear that one must know the meaning of what one says when praying to god . d  432  going near prayer may signify going into mosques  and the meaning in that case would be unless you pass  through the mosques  as by a way . 116 4 . women â « 444 come from the toilet  or you have had  sexual  contact with women   and you can not find water  then resort to pure earth and wipe your faces and your hands  with it  . surely allah is ever pardoning  forgiving . 44 do you not see those to whom a portion of the book was given  they buy error and desire to make you go astray from the  right  way . 45 and allah best knows your enemies . and allah is sufficient as a friend and allah is sufficient as a helper . 46 some of those who are jews alter words from their places e and say  we have heard and we disobey  and  say   hear without being made to hear  and  say   ra ind  distorting with their tongues and slandering religion . and if they had said  we hear and we obey  and listen  and unzurna  it would have been better for them and more upright  but allah has cursed them on account of their disbelief  so they do not believe except a little . 47 you who have been given the book  believe in what we have revealed  verifying what you  already  have  6 before we destroy the leaders and turn them on their backs  or curse them as we cursed the sabbath breakers . and the command of allah is ever executed . 48 surely allah does not forgive that a partner should be set up with him  and forgives all besides that to whom he pleases . and whoever sets up a partner with allah  he devises indeed a a  433  literally   you have touched women   which is a euphemism for sexual intercourse . many of the fine phrases used in the quran to express this delicate relation were unknown to the arabs . b  434  tayammum means striking both hands on pure earth  or anything containing pure dust  and then passing the hands over the face and the backs of the hands . when water is not found  or is likely to do harm  tayammum suffices instead of ablution before prayer . c  461  the corruption of the previous books is constantly referred to in the quran  and  as the words clearly show  it implies a corruption of the text as well as a false rendering of it . d  462  see 2  104 and footnote . e  47  the verification referred to here and elsewhere implies only a verifi cation of the general principles and the prophecies contained in the earlier books . 4  49 â€¢ kingdom granted to abraham s descendants 1 1 7 great sin . a 49 have you not seen those who attribute purity to them selves   rather  allah purifies whom he pleases  and they will not be dealt with unjustly in the least . 50 see how they forge lies against allah  and sufficient is this as a manifest sin . section 8  kingdom granted to abraham s descendants 51 have you not seen those to whom a portion of the book was given  they believe in sorcery and diviners c and say of those who disbelieve  these are better guided in the path than those who believe . 52 those are they whom allah has cursed . and whomever allah curses  you will not find a helper for him . 53 0r have they a share in the kingdom  but then they would not give to people even the speck on a datestone . 54 0r do they envy the people for what allah has given them of his grace  but indeed we have given to abraham s children the book and the wisdom  and we have given them a grand kingdom . e 55 so some of them believe in a  48  shirk or setting up partners with allah is spoken of as the gravest sin . wrong belief in false deities lowers the dignity of man . man is made to rule nature itself and all creatures  but when he lowers himself before creatures lower than himself  he sets at naught the very purpose of his creation . it should be noted that shirk or setting up gods with god also includes blind obedience rendered to leaders  see 931 and also the next footnote . it should also be noted that if a person guilty of shirk repents of it before his death then all his sins including shirk are forgiven because he gives a new turn to his life . even those who die while guilty of shirk will  after suffering the consequences of their deeds in the after life  be received into the mercy of god . b  49  these are the priests  doctors of law and monks who demanded blind obedience from their followers  and include such ulama  shaikhs and pirs among the muslims as well . c  51  these words seem to refer to the general debasement of the jews  who believed in all kinds of enchantment  divination  and sorcery  and had long bidden farewell in practice to the pure monotheism of moses . d  53  this shows that a temporal or worldly kingdom can not be granted to a nation which would not deal liberally with others . e  54  by the people are meant the arabs . the promised kingdom was still in abraham s seed  but was now transferred from the descendants of israel to those of ishmael  in accordance with the covenant made with abraham . 118 4 . women â « 456 him  and some of them turn away from him .  and hell is suffi cient to burn . 56 those who disbelieve in our messages  we shall make them enter fire . as often as their skins are burned  we shall change them for other skins  that they may taste the punishment . surely allah is ever mighty  wise . 57 and those who believe and do good deeds  we shall make them enter gardens in which rivers flow  to abide in them forever . they will have therein pure companions and we shall make them enter a pleasant shade . 58 surely allah commands you to make over trusts to those worthy of them  and that when you judge between people  you judge with justice . 6 surely allah instructs you with what is excellent . surely allah is ever hearing  seeing . 59 you who believe  obey allah and obey the messenger and those in authority from among you  then if you quarrel about anything  refer it to allah and the messenger  if you believe in allah and the last day . e this is best and more suitable to  achieve  the end . section 9  the prophet must be obeyed 60 have you not seen those who assert that they believe in what has been revealed to you and what was revealed before you  they desire to seek the judgment of the devil  though they have a  55  by  him  is meant the holy prophet muhammad  who was now the true exponent of abraham s religion . b  58  muslims  having been granted worldly rule  are here told to entrust the affairs of state to people who are worthy of this responsibility  while the autho rities and judges so entrusted are required to judge with justice . c  59  this verse lays down three important rules in matters relating to the welfare of the muslim community and to affairs of state . these are obedience to god and his messenger in the first place  secondly  obedience to those in autho rity from among the muslims  and thirdly  referring matters to god and his messenger in cases of dispute with those in authority . god and his messenger are thus the final authority . it is especially in matters religious that differences would arise  in which case it would be necessary to refer the matter to god and his messenger  in other words to the quran and hadith . in case of muslims living under nonmuslim authority  islam requires them to abide by the laws of the land . 461  the prophet must be obeyed 1 1 9 been commanded to deny him . and the devil desires to lead them far astray . 61 and when it is said to them  come to what allah has revealed and to the messenger  you see the hypocrites turning away from you with aversion . 62 but how is it that when a misfortune befalls them on account of what their hands have already done  they come to you swearing by allah  we desired nothing but good and concord  63 these are they  the secrets of whose hearts allah knows  so turn aside from them and admonish them and speak to them effective words concerning themselves . 64 and we sent no messenger but that he should be obeyed by allah s command . and if they had  when they wronged them selves  come to you and asked forgiveness of allah  and the messenger had  also  asked forgiveness for them  they would have found allah oftreturning  to mercy   merciful . 65 but no  by your lord  they do not believe until they make you a judge of what is in dispute between them  then find no reluctance in their hearts as to what you decide and submit with full submission . 66 and if we had ordained for them  lay down your lives or go forth from your homes  they would not have done it except a few of them .  and if they had done what they are exhorted to do  it would certainly have been better for them and more strengthening  67 and then we would certainly have given them from ourselves a great reward  68 and we would certainly have guided them in the right path . 69 and whoever obeys allah and the messenger  they are with those upon whom allah has bestowed favours from among the prophets and the truthful and the faithful and the righteous  and a goodly company are they  a  66  the companions of the holy prophet had to lay down their lives in defence of their faith  and had to leave their homes for the sake of their religion . but the hypocrites at madinah were too weak of heart to undergo such hardships . they were only required to contribute to the struggle which was being carried on for national defence and to obey the prophet  s orders which was a far easier task  but they did not do even this . b  69  those upon whom allah has bestowed favours are spoken of as belonging to four classes   1  the prophets   2  the truthful â€ ” those who are true in their sayings and their belief  and confirm their truth by their deeds or acting   3  the faithful â€ ” those who bear witness to the truth both by words and deeds  120 4 . women â€¢ 4  70 70 such is the grace from allah  and allah is sufficient as knower . section 10  believers must defend themselves 71 o you who believe  take your precautions  then go forth in detachments or go forth in a body . 72 and among you is he who would hang back . then if a misfortune befalls you  he says  allah indeed bestowed a favour on me as i was not present with them . 73 and if bounty from allah comes to you  he would cry  as if there were no friendship between you and him  if only i had been with them  then i should have achieved a mighty success  74 so let those fight in the way of allah who sell this world s life for the here after . and whoever fights in the way of allah  whether he is killed or is victorious  we shall grant him a mighty reward . 75 and what reason have you not to fight in the way of allah  and of the weak among the men and the women and the children  who say  our lord  take us out of this town  whose people are oppressors  and grant us from yourself a friend  and grant us from yourself a helper   76 those who believe fight in the way of allah  and those who disbelieve fight in the way of the devil . so fight against the friends of the devil  surely the struggle of the devil is ever weak . and one slain in defence of his religion is included because he too gives evidence of the truth of religion by laying down his life   4  the righteous or those who stick to the right course in all their deeds  come what may . those who obey allah and the messenger are here told that they are with the perfect ones who belong to these four classes . thus this verse promises to those who have not attained to per fection the company  in the life to come  of those who have attained to perfection when the former have done their best to obey god and his messenger . it may be added that no one can become a prophet by obeying the holy prophet . if this were true  not only would all the truthful and the faithful and the righteous be prophets  because they perfectly obeyed allah and his messenger  but even all those who tried to follow them would also be prophets which is absurd . a  75  this explains what is meant by fighting in the way of allah . while most of the believers who had the means had escaped from makkah  there remained those who were weak and unable to undertake a journey . these were still persecuted and oppressed at makkah . fighting to deliver them from the per secution of their oppressors was really fighting in the way of allah . 4  77 â€¢ attitude of the hypocrites 121 section 1 1  attitude of the hypocrites 77 have you not seen those to whom it was said  withhold your hands  and keep up prayer and give the due charity . but when fighting is prescribed for them  then some of them fear men as they ought to fear allah  or with a greater fear  and say  our lord  why have you ordained fighting for us  would you not grant us respite for a little while   say  the enjoyment of this world is short  and the hereafter is better for him who keeps his duty . and you will not be dealt with unjustly in the least . 78 wherever you are  death will overtake you  though you are in towers  raised high . and if good befalls them  they say  this is from allah  and if a misfortune befalls them  they say  this is from you . say  all is from allah . but what is the matter with these people that they make no effort to understand anything  79 whatever good befalls you  o man   it is from allah  and whatever misfortune befalls you  it is from yourself . and we have sent you  o prophet  to man kind as a messenger . and allah is sufficient as a witness . 80 whoever obeys the messenger  he indeed obeys allah . and whoever turns away  we have not sent you as a keeper over them . 81 and they say  obedience . but when they go out from your presence  a group of them plan by night doing otherwise than what you say . and allah writes down what they plan by night  so turn aside from them and trust in allah . and allah is sufficient as hav ing charge of affairs . 82 will they not then meditate on the quran  a  77  had there been any hope of plunder to animate the ranks of muslims  those who loved this world most  who are here called the hypocrites  would have been foremost in fighting  but as they knew that they were fighting against odds  they considered acting on this order as equivalent to courting death  and requested to be granted a respite until they died a natural death . b  79  good and evil  or benefits and misfortunes  proceed from allah  but while he sends benefits from himself  i.e . out of his beneficence  no evil or mis fortune afflicts a man unless his own hands have called for it . the previous verse states that the hypocrites attributed their misfortunes to the prophet  they are told  in the words  all is from allah   that misfortunes were sent by allah . this verse tells them that  though sent by allah  the immediate cause of these misfortunes was to be found in their own doings . 122 4 . women â€¢ 4  83 and if it were from any other than allah  they would have found in it many a discrepancy . a 83 but if any news of security or fear comes to them  they spread it about . and if they had referred it to the messenger and to those in authority among them  those of them who can search out knowledge of it would have known it . and if it were not for the grace of allah upon you and his mercy  you would certainly have followed the devil except a few . 84 fight then in allah s way â€ ” you are not responsible except for yourself  and urge on the believers . it may be that allah will restrain the fighting of those who disbelieve . and allah is stronger in prowess and stronger to give exemplary punishment . 85 whoever intercedes in a good cause has a share of it  and whoever intercedes in an evil cause has a portion of it . and allah is ever keeper over all things . c 86 and when you are greeted with a greeting  greet with one better than it  or return it . surely allah a  82  the quran was not written out and given on one occasion  but it con tinued to be delivered in small portions during twentythree years under the most varying circumstances . but what is striking throughout the entire revelation is that it keeps up one and the same strain â€ ” absolute submission to allah  entire trust in him  perfect confidence of future success  a liberal view of humanity  an attitude of charity towards all nations and religions  and goodness to all alike . the spirit of the revelations to the solitary  persecuted  and rejected preacher of makkah does not differ in these and a hundred other particulars from the spirit of the revelations to the sole temporal and spiritual monarch of arabia . b  84  the primary duty to defend islam lay on the holy prophet alone  as against all the forces of arabia . this shows that he never put any trust in the prowess of his followers  and his confidence was based solely on divine help . c  85  the meaning is that he who joins himself to another and assists him  and becomes to him as one of a pair or an intercessor in doing good or evil  and thus aids him and strengthens him  partakes with him the benefit or the harm of it . interceding here also implies that one institutes for another a way of good or a way of evil which the other imitates  and thus becomes to him as one of a pair . the connection is clear  the prophet made himself an example of good for others to imitate or to aid him . for the meaning of intercession see 2255 footnote 1. d  86  a greeting is a prayer for the good of another  tahiyyah  the word used for it here  meaning originally a prayer for one s long life . the minimum require ment is that a greeting must be returned in the same words . what is really aimed at is that a muslim should always wish good for  or do good to  his brother  and the other is required to do greater good in return . 4  87 â€¢ how to deal with the hypocrites 123 ever takes account of all things . 87 allah  there is no god but he â€ ” he will certainly gather you together on the day of resurrection  there is no doubt in it . and who is more true in word than allah  section 12  how to deal with the hypocrites 88 why should you  then  be two parties in relation to the hypocrites while allah has made them return  to disbelief  for what they have earned  do you desire to guide him whom allah leaves in error  and whomsoever allah leaves in error you can not find a way for him . 89 they long that you should disbelieve as they have disbelieved so that you might be on the same level  so do not take from among them friends until they flee  their homes  in allah s way . then if they turn back  to hostility   seize them and kill them wherever you find them  and take no friend nor helper from among them  90 except those who join a people between whom and you there is an alliance  or who come to you  their hearts shrinking from fighting you or fighting their own people . and if allah had pleased  he would have given them power over you  so that they would have fought you . so if they withdraw from you and do not fight you and offer you peace  then allah allows you no way against them .  91 you will find others who desire to be secure from you and secure from their own people . whenever they are made to return to hostility  they are plunged into it . so if they do not withdraw from you  nor offer you peace and restrain their hands  then seize them and kill them wherever you find them . and against these we have given you a clear authority . a  90  this shows clearly that even waverers were not to be killed or fought against if they refrained from fighting  though they may have gone over to disbelief after accepting islam . the persons referred to in this verse were disbelie vers and not muslims . note also that we have here the clear injunction that if any people offered peace  they were not to be fought against . b  91  editor s note  the meaning of the words  then seize them and kill them wherever you find them  is clearly shown by the preceding text   so if they do not withdraw from you  nor offer you peace and restrain their hands  . those enemies are meant who themselves attacked the muslims first . the words  kill them wherever you find them  also occur in 2190191  preceded by   and fight in the way of allah against those who fight against you but do not be aggressive  . 124 4 . women â€¢ 4  92 section 13  murderer of a muslim 92 and a believer would not kill a believer except by mistake .  and he who kills a believer by mistake should free a believing slave  and bloodmoney should be paid to his people unless they forgo it as charity . but if he is from a tribe hostile to you and he is a believer  the freeing of a believing slave  is sufficient  . and if he is from a tribe between whom and you there is a covenant  the bloodmoney should be paid to his people along with the freeing of a believing slave  but he who has not the means should fast for two months successively  a penance from allah . and allah is ever knowing  wise . 93 and whoever kills a believer intentionally  his punishment is hell  abiding in it  and allah is furious with him and he has cursed him and prepared for him a grievous punishment . 94 o you who believe  when you go forth  to fight  in allah s way  make investigation  and do not say to anyone who offers you salutation  fou are not a believer  seeking the good of this world s life . e but with allah there are abundant gains . you too were such before  then allah conferred a benefit on you  so make investiga tion . surely allah is ever aware of what you do . 95 those who hold back from among the believers  not disabled by injury  and those who strive hard in allah s way with their property and their a  92  the man who killed a believer intentionally could not be a believer . disbelievers often made use of ruses  professing belief in islam and thus tempting muslims to go over to them as religious teachers  and afterwards murdering them . b  93  the commentators are agreed that this verse speaks of a disbeliever who murders a believer . in fact  the word intentionally stands here for murdering a man because he is a believer  as this was what the disbelievers often did . c  94  the original word for salutation is salam  meaning peace  . the first word of the muslim salutation stands therefore for the muslim salutation . the muslims were surrounded by enemies on all sides  yet they were told not to pre sume that every arab tribe belonged to the enemy camp but were to make an investigation first . even when a man belonging to an enemy tribe offered the muslim salutation  to show that he was a muslim  he was to be taken as a brother muslim and could not be dealt with as an enemy . incidentally  it lays down the principle that no muslim can be called a kafir  not even the man whose claim to islam is borne out only by offering the muslim salutation . 496  muslims who remained with the enemy 125 persons  are not equal . allah has made those who strive with their property and their persons to excel those who hold back by a  high  degree . and to each allah has promised good . and allah has granted to those who strive above those who hold back a mighty reward â€ ”   high  degrees from him and protection and mercy . and allah is ever forgiving  merciful . section 14  muslims who remained with the enemy 97  as for  those whom the angels cause to die while they are unjust to themselves   the angels  will say  what were you doing  they will say  we were weak in the earth .  the angels  will say  was not allah s earth spacious  so that you could have migrated in it  so these it is whose refuge is hell â€ ” and it is an evil destination .  98 except the weak from among the men and the women and the children who do not have the means  nor can they find a way  to escape    so these  it may be that allah will pardon them . and allah is ever pardoning  forgiving . 100 and whoever flees in allah s way  he will find in the earth many a place of escape and abundant resources . and whoever goes forth from his home fleeing to allah and his messenger  then death overtakes him  his reward is indeed with allah . and allah is ever forgiving  merciful . section 15  prayer when fighting 101 and when you journey in the earth  there is no blame on you if you shorten the prayer  if you fear that those who disbelieve will give you trouble .  surely the disbelievers are an open enemy to you . 102 and when you are among them and lead the prayer for a  97  by those who were unjust to themselves are meant persons who were convinced of the truth of islam  but chose to remain among the disbelievers  who did not allow them to give expression to their beliefs  despite having the means to join the muslims and avow islam openly . b  101  the prayer service on a journey is shorter than the ordinary prayer service in the zuhr  midday   asr  afternoon  and isha   night  prayers but the shortening of prayer as mentioned in this verse is quite different from the ordinary shorter service of the journey  and its details are given in the next verse . 126 4 . women â€¢ 4  103 them  let a group of them stand up with you  and let them take their arms . then when they have performed their prostration  let them go to your rear  and let another group who have not prayed come forward and pray with you  and let them take their pre cautions and their arms . those who disbelieve long that you may neglect your arms and your baggage  that they may attack you with a sudden united attack . and there is no blame on you  if you are inconvenienced on account of rain or if you are sick  to put away your arms  and take your precautions . surely allah has pre pared a humiliating punishment for the disbelievers .  103 so when you have finished the prayer  remember allah standing and sitting and reclining . but when you are secure  from danger  keep up  regular  prayer . prayer indeed has been enjoined on the believers at fixed times . 4 104 and do not be weakhearted in pursuit of the enemy . if you suffer they  too  suffer as you suffer  and you hope from allah what they do not hope . and allah is ever knowing  wise . section 16  hypocrites are dishonest 105 surely we have revealed the book to you with truth that you may judge between people by means of what allah has taught you . and do not be one pleading the cause of the dishonest a  102  this verse and the previous one show the importance of prayer and of offering prayer in congregation in islam  which could not be neglected even on the field of battle . b  103  the hours of prayer were fixed by the prophet under divine guid ance  and the observance of the hours of prayer is an essential part of the due observance of prayer . it is this feature of the islamic prayer which makes it a unique force in the unification of the human race . c  105  the occasion of the revelation of these verses was a dispute between a muslim and a jew  in which judgment was given by the prophet against the muslim . it was a time when every muslim hand was sorely needed for the defence of islam  and a verdict against a man supported by his whole tribe meant the loss of that tribe . but such considerations did not carry any weight with the prophet . thus these verses lay down the broad principle that dishonesty must be punished  and the balance of justice must be held equal between muslims and nonmuslims and between friends and foes . 4  106 â€¢ hypocrites 127 106 and ask the forgiveness of allah .  surely allah is ever for giving  merciful . 107 and do not contend on behalf of those who act unfaithfully to their souls . surely allah does not love him who is treacherous  sinful  108 they seek to hide from people and they can not hide from allah  and he is with them when they counsel by night matters which do not please him . and allah ever encom passes what they do . 109 look  you are they who may contend on their behalf in this world s life  but who will contend with allah on their behalf on the day of resurrection  or who will have charge of their affairs  110 and whoever does evil or wrongs his soul  then asks forgiveness of allah  will find allah forgiving  merciful . ni and whoever commits a sin  commits it only against himself . and allah is ever knowing  wise . 112 and whoever commits a fault or a sin  then accuses of it one innocent  he indeed takes upon himself the burden of a slander and a manifest sin . section 17  secret counsels of the hypocrites 113 and if it were not for allah s grace upon you and his mercy  a group of them had certainly aimed to ruin you . and they ruin only themselves  and they can not harm you in any way . and allah has revealed to you the book and the wisdom  and taught you what you did not know  and allah s grace on you is very great . 114 there is no good in most of their secret counsels except  in  him who enjoins charity or goodness or reconciliation between people . and whoever does this  seeking allah s pleasure  we shall give him a mighty reward . 115 and whoever acts hostilely to the messenger after guidance has become manifest to him and follows other than the way of the believers  we turn him to that to a  106  the injunction in this as well as the previous verse is meant for every muslim who is called upon to act as a judge . he must be strictly just as between his own people and aliens  and must further ask the protection of allah from being guilty of an act of injustice  even unknowingly . b  108  those who supported the guilty man are condemned here as hypo crites . the same subject is continued in the verses that follow . 128 4 . women 4116 which he  himself  turns and make him enter hell  and it is an evil destination .  section 18  idolatry condemned 116 surely allah does not forgive setting up partners with him  and he forgives all besides this to whom he pleases . and whoever sets up a partner with allah  he indeed goes far astray . 117 besides him they call on nothing but female divinities and they call on nothing but a rebellious devil  118 whom allah has cursed . and he said  certainly i will take of your servants an appointed portion  119 and certainly i will lead them astray and excite in them vain desires and bid them so that they will slit the ears of the cattle and bid them so that they will alter allah s creation . and whoever takes the devil for a friend  forsaking allah  he indeed suffers a manifest loss . 120 he promises them and excites vain desires in them . and the devil promises them only to deceive . 121 these â€ ” their refuge is hell  and they will find no way of escape from it . 122 and those who believe and do good  we shall make them enter gardens in which rivers flow  to abide in them forever . it is a  115  this verse clearly speaks of the hypocrites  who followed a way other than the way of the believers . only a distortion of the words could make them signify that it was a sin to differ with the majority of the muslims on any question of religion . b  117  the word translated here as  female divinities  can signify inanimate things  such as trees and stones and wood  which they worshipped  as well as idols because they named the idols as females . c  1191  the practice of slitting or cutting off the ear of certain animals was a prevalent form of polytheism in arabia  for such an animal was looked upon as devoted to certain idols . d  1192  a comparison with 3030 will show clearly that by allah s crea tion is here meant the religion of allah  the natural religion of man . by the devil s changing the creation of allah is therefore meant the changing of the natural reli gion of man which requires obedience to allah and his laws . some commentators understand by changing the creation of allah the using of his created things for an object other than that for which they were created  and worshipping objects such as the sun  etc.  which were really created to be subservient to man . 4123  equitable dealings 129 allah s promise  in truth . and who is more truthful in word than allah  123 it will not be in accordance with your vain desires nor the vain desires of the people of the book . whoever does evil  will be recompensed for it and will not find for himself besides allah a friend or a helper .  124 and whoever does good deeds  whether male or female  and is a believer â€ ” these will enter the garden  and they will not be dealt with unjustly in the least . 125 and who is better in religion than he who submits himself entirely to allah while doing good  to others  and follows the faith of abraham  the upright one  and allah took abraham for a friend . 126 and to allah belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is in the earth . and allah ever encompasses all things . section 19  equitable dealings with orphans and widows 127 and they ask you a decision about women . say  allah makes known to you his decision concerning them  and what is recited to you in the book is concerning widowed women  whom you do not give what is appointed for them  while you are not inclined to marry them  nor to the weak among children  and that you should deal justly with orphans . and whatever good you do  allah is surely ever knower of it . 128 and if a woman fears a  123  editor s note  divine reward is not bestowed upon anyone in accor dance with their vain desires  whether they are muslims or jews or christians . people are judged by their deeds  and rewarded or punished accordingly . b  127  it is stated here that a decision regarding the doing of good to women  to weak children and to orphans has already been given  see 4  110  . the words  and what is recited to you in the book is concerning widowed women  whom you do not give what is appointed for them while you are not inclined to marry them  refer to 43 . the meaning is that the order given in 43 in the words  if you fear that you can not do justice to orphans marry such women as seem good to you  relates to orphans of the women  or to widows  whom their share in inheritance was denied  both their share and the share of their orphan children  nor were people inclined to marry them owing to the burden which they brought with them in the shape of their children . so the permission was given that they may marry such women  even up to four . widows and their orphaned children used to receive no share of inheritance . the quran brought about a great change  it re quired the giving of inheritance both to women and their orphaned children  and it also recommended that such women should be taken in marriage . 130 4 . women 4129 illusage from her husband or desertion  there is no blame on the two of them if they effect a reconciliation between them . and reconciliation is better . and greed is met with in  people s  minds . and if you do good  to others  and keep your duty  surely allah is ever aware of what you do . 129 and you can not do justice between wives  even though you wish  it   but do not be disinclined  from one  with total disinclination  so that you leave her in suspense . and if you are reconciled and keep your duty  surely allah is ever forgiving  merciful . 130 and if they separate  allah will render them both free from want out of his ampleness . and allah is ever amplegiving  wise . 131 and to allah belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is in the earth . and certainly we charged those who were given the book before you  and  we also charge  you  to keep your duty to allah . and if you disbelieve  surely to allah belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is in the earth . and allah is ever selfsufficient  praiseworthy . 132 and to allah belongs what ever is in the heavens and whatever is in the earth . and allah is sufficient as having charge of affairs . 133 if he please  he will take you away  o people  and bring others . and allah is ever powerful to do that . i 34 whoever desires the reward of this world â€ ” then with allah is the reward of this world and the hereafter . and allah is ever hearing  seeing . section 20  hypocrisy condemned 135 o you who believe  be maintainers of justice  bearers of witness for allah  even if it is against your own selves or  your  parents or near relatives â€ ” whether he is rich or poor  allah has a better right over them both .  so do not follow  your  low desires  that you deviate . and if you distort  the truth  or turn away  from it   surely allah is ever aware of what you do . a  135   allah has a better right over them  means that they should be dealt with justly . thus  neither ties of kinship and love nor considerations of fear  favour  or compassion should make one swerve a hair s breadth from the truth . 4136  end of the hypocrites 1 3 1 136 o you who believe  believe in allah and his messenger and the book which he has revealed to his messenger and the book which he revealed before . and whoever disbelieves in allah and his angels and his books and his messengers and the last day  he indeed strays far away . 137 those who believe then disbelieve  again believe and again disbelieve  then increase in disbelief  allah will never forgive them nor guide them in the  right  way . a 138 give news to the hypocrites that for them is a painful punishment â€ ” 139 those who take disbelievers for friends rather than believers . do they seek for might from them  might surely belongs wholly to allah . 140 and indeed he has revealed to you in the book that when you hear allah s messages disbelieved in and mocked at  do not sit with them until they enter into some other discourse  for then indeed you would be like them . surely allah will gather together the hypocrites and the disbelievers all in hell â€ ” 141 those who wait  for misfortunes  for you . then if you have a victory from allah they say  were we not with you  and if there is a chance for the disbelievers  they say  did we not prevail over you and defend you from the believers  so allah will judge between you on the day of resurrection . and allah will by no means give the disbelievers a way against the believers . section 21  end of the hypocrites 142 the hypocrites seek to deceive allah  and he will pay them back their deceit . and when they stand up for prayer  they stand up sluggishly â€ ” they do it only to be seen by people and a  137  allah s not guiding them is the consequence of their own actions . they wavered first but in the end became firm in disbelief . b  140  see 668 which was revealed at makkah . muslims are told to leave the assembly where truth is derided . criticism is quite a different thing and a muslim should always be ready to meet any criticism of his religion .  editor s note  thus the response when faced with mere ridicule of islam is to withdraw  temporarily  from that company of people and rejoin them later when they stop their mocking . it is therefore entirely wrong to believe that muslims are required to attack physically  still less kill  those who deride their religion .  132 4 . women â€¢ 4  143 they remember allah but little  143 wavering between that  and this  â€ ”  belonging  neither to these nor to those .  and whomsoever allah leaves in error  you will not find a way for him . 144 you who believe  do not take the disbelievers for friends instead of the believers . do you desire to give allah a manifest proof against yourselves  145 the hypocrites are surely in the lowest depths of the fire  and you will find no helper for them  146 except those who repent and amend and hold fast to allah and are sincere in their obedience to allah â€ ” these are with the believers . and allah will soon grant the believers a mighty reward . 147 why should allah punish you if you are grateful and believe  and allah is ever multiplier of rewards  knowing . on 148 allah does not love the public utterance of hurtful speech  â « â– except by one who has been wronged . c and allah is ever hearing  knowing . 149 if you do good openly or keep it secret or pardon an evil  allah surely is ever pardoning  powerful . 150 those who disbelieve in allah and his messengers and desire to make a distinction between allah and his messengers and say  we believe in some and disbelieve in others  and desire to take a course in between â€ ” 151 these are truly disbelievers  and we have prepared for the disbelievers a humiliating punishment . 152 and those who believe in allah and his messengers and make no distinction between any of them  to them he will grant their rewards . and allah is ever forgiving  merciful . 6 a  143  the reference in  that and this  is to belief and disbelief . b  147  the word shakir  usually meaning thankful  when used as an attri bute of the divine being signifies one who multiplies rewards to his servants . c  148  the use of defamatory speech of every kind regarding others is stric tly forbidden  but justification for it may exist in case a person has in some way been wronged . rf  149  if you pardon the evil which anyone has done to you  allah will pardon your evils  and grant you even good reward  he is not only pardoning  but also powerful to grant good reward . e  152  to make distinction between allah and his messengers means to believe in one and not in the other . islam requires the acceptance of all prophets who were raised for the regeneration of mankind  and hence a denial of any one of 4153  transgressions of the jews 133 section 22  transgressions of the jews 153 the people of the book ask you to bring down to them a book from heaven  indeed they demanded of moses a greater thing than that  for they said  show us allah manifestly . so destructive punishment overtook them on account of their wrongdoing . then they took the calf  for a god   after clear signs had come to them  but we pardoned this . and we gave moses clear authority . 154 and we raised the mountain above them at their covenant . and we said to them  enter the gate submissively . and we said to them  do not violate the sabbath  and we took from them a firm covenant . 155 then for their breaking their covenant and their disbelief in the messages of allah and their killing the prophets unjustly and their saying  our hearts are securely covered  no  allah has sealed them on account of their disbelief  so they do not believe but a little   156 and for their disbelief and for their uttering against mary a grievous slander  157 and for their saying  we have killed the messiah  jesus  son of mary  the messenger of allah  and they did not kill him  nor did they cause his death on the cross  c but he the prophets named in the quran takes a person out of the category of believers and places him among the disbelievers . a  155  the incidents referred to in verses 153155 have been mentioned in detail in 25171  see the footnotes there . b  156  the slander referred to was that mary was guilty of fornication . c  1571  the words used here do not negative that jesus was nailed to the cross  they negative his having expired on the cross as a result of being nailed to it . that jesus died a natural death is plainly stated in 5117 . the gospels contain clear testimony showing that jesus christ escaped death on the cross . for example  jesus remained on the cross for a few hours only  mark 1525  john 1914  but death by crucifixion was always slow . when the side of jesus was pierced  blood rushed out and this was a certain sign of life  john 1934  . jesus was not buried but was given into the charge of a wealthy disciple of his  who lavished care on him and put him in a spacious tomb hewn in the side of a rock  mark 1546  . when the tomb was seen on the third day  the stone was found to have been removed from its mouth  mark 164   which would not have been the case if there had been a supernatural rising . jesus christ prayed the whole night before his arrest to be saved from the accursed death on the cross  and he also asked his disciples to pray for him . he seems to have even received a promise from god to 134 4 . women â€¢ 4  158 was made to appear to them as such .  and certainly those who differ concerning it are in doubt about it . they have no knowledge about it  but only follow a conjecture  and they did not kill him for certain  158 rather  allah exalted him in his presence . and allah is ever mighty  wise . 159 and there is none of the people of the book but will believe in this before his death  and on the day of resurrection he will be a witness against them . c 160 so for the wrongdoing of the jews  we forbade them the good things which had been made lawful for them  and for their hindering many  people  from allah s way . 161 and for their taking usury â€ ” though indeed they were forbidden it â€ ” and their devouring the property of people falsely . and we have prepared for the disbelievers from among them a painful punishment . 162 but the firm in knowledge among them and the believers believe in be saved  and it was to this promise that he referred when he cried out on the cross   my god  my god  why have you forsaken me   the statements made in the quran corroborate the testimony found in the gospels . jesus did not die on the cross  nor was he killed as were the two thieves who were crucified with him  but to people he appeared as if he were dead . a  1572  these words may bear two interpretations  he was made to be like it to them or the matter was made dubious to them . the story that someone else was made to resemble jesus is not borne out by the words of the quran  which could only mean  if an object were mentioned  that jesus was made to resemble someone  not that someone was made to resemble jesus . b  158  for  exaltation  see 355 footnote 2 . being exalted in the divine presence was opposed to being killed on the cross . deuteronomy 2123 explains this  for there we have  he who is hanged is accursed of god . if jesus had died on the cross he would have been accursed  hence the statement made here â€ ” he was not killed on the cross and accursed but he was exalted in the divine presence . c  159  both jews and christians necessarily believe in the death of jesus on the cross  while according to the quran they have really no sure knowledge of it . the belief of the jews is that since jesus died on the cross he was accursed of god  and hence he can not be a prophet . following quite a different line of argu ment  christians believe that jesus died on the cross and was accursed  but that unless jesus were accursed he could not take away the sins of those that believe in him . hence the belief of both jews and christians is that jesus died on the cross  and the meaning of the verse is clear  i.e.  every jew and christian  despite having no sure knowledge at all  must believe before his death that jesus died on the cross . 4  1 63 â€¢ previous revelation and the quran 135 what has been revealed to you and what was revealed before you  and those who keep up prayer and give the due charity and the believers in allah and the last day â€ ” these it is to whom we shall give a mighty reward . section 23  previous revelation and the quran 163 surely we have revealed to you as we revealed to noah and the prophets after him  and we revealed to abraham and ishmael and isaac and jacob and the tribes  and jesus and job and jonah and aaron and solomon  and we gave to david a scripture . 164 and  we sent  messengers we have mentioned to you before and messengers we have not mentioned to you . and to moses allah addressed his word  speaking  to him  â€ ” 165 messengers  bearers of good news  and warners  so that the people may have no plea against allah after the  coming of  messengers . and allah is ever mighty  wise . 166 but allah bears witness by what he has revealed to you that he has revealed it with his knowledge  and the angels  also  bear witness . and allah is sufficient as a witness . 167 those who disbelieve and hinder  others  from allah s way  they indeed have gone astray  straying far . 168 those who dis believe and act unjustly  allah will never forgive them  nor guide them to a path  169 except the path of hell  to abide in it for a long time . and that is easy to allah . 170 o mankind  the messenger has indeed come to you with truth from your lord  so believe  it is better for you . and if you disbelieve  then surely to allah belongs whatever is in the heavens and the earth . and allah is ever knowing  wise . 171 people of the book  do not exaggerate in the matter of your religion nor speak anything about allah but the truth . the messiah  jesus  son of mary  is only a messenger of allah and his word which he a  165  the good news which these messengers brought relates as much to the peace and happiness which is granted to the righteous as to the advent of one who  coming at the end  should unite the qualifications of all the prophets in his own person  and accordingly make the nations of the earth as one nation . b  1711  kalima  or word  is here equivalent to prophecy  in which sense it 136 4 . women â » 4172 communicated to mary and a mercy from him . a so believe in allah and his messengers . and do not say  three . refrain  from it   it is better for you . allah is only one god . far be it from his glory to have a son . to him belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is in the earth . and sufficient is allah as having charge of affairs . section 24  prophethood of jesus 172 the messiah does not disdain to be a servant of allah  nor do the angels who are near to him . and whoever disdains his service and is proud  he will gather them all together to himself . 173 then as for those who believe and do good  he will pay them fully their rewards and give them more out of his grace . and as for those who disdain and are proud  he will punish them with a painful punishment  and they will find for themselves besides allah no friend nor helper . 174 o people  manifest proof has indeed come to you from your lord and we have sent down to you a clear light . 17s then as for those who believe in allah and hold fast by him  he will admit them to his mercy and grace  and guide them to himself on a right path . 176 they ask you for a decision . say  allah gives you a deci sion concerning the person who has neither parents nor children . is frequently used in the quran . jesus is called a prophecy because he was born in accordance with a prophecy from god . a  1712  ruh also means mercy  as translated here . it also signifies inspira tion or divine revelation  and if this significance is adopted it would be an expla nation of the foregoing words  i.e . his prophecy which he communicated to mary . even if we take spirit to be the meaning of the word ruh  it does not take jesus beyond the limits of mortality  because according to the quran the spirit of god is breathed into every human being  329  . moreover  the words used here can only mean a spirit from him and not the spirit from him . b  1713  the doctrine of trinity is plainly rejected here . there are not three persons in godhead  but only one  allah is only one god . the quran nowhere says that the christian trinity is formed of jesus  mary  and god  although it no doubt refers to the roman catholic doctrine of the worship of mary in 51 16 . 4  176 â€¢ prophethood of jesus 137 if a man dies  and  he has no son and he has a sister  hers is half of what he leaves  and he shall be her heir if she has no son . but if there are two  sisters   they shall have twothirds of what he leaves . and if there are  both  brothers and sisters  then for the male is the like of the portion of two females . allah makes clear to you  in case you go astray . and allah is knower of all things .  a  176  the rule given here supplements the law of inheritance as given at the commencement of this chapter . here there are neither children nor parents and therefore the whole of the inheritance goes to the brothers and the sisters . rever sion to the law of inheritance just after speaking of jesus has perhaps a deeper meaning . it is a fact that no prophet appeared among the israelites after jesus  and therefore his death really left israel without a spiritual head who should rise to the eminence of prophethood . the spiritual kingdom which was promised to abraham  and which hitherto remained in the house of israel  was now taken from the israelites and made over to the brother nation  the ishmaelites . this would also explain the words addressed to moses   the lord your god will raise up for you a prophet like me from your midst  from your brethren   deuteronomy  1815  . chapter 5 almaidah food the name of this chapter refers to the demand for food  or physical sus tenance  by the followers of jesus and the granting of jesus  prayer for his earlier and later followers  verses 1 121 15  . not only physical food  but god sent down for them spiritual food in the form of the quran  which  perfected  religion  v. 3  . the chapter deals with the deviation of the jews and chris tians from the truth and their hostility towards islam . it contains directions for muslims on several points and warns them to avoid the errors into which previous nations fell . it ends with a refutation of the doctrine of jesus  divinity and gives hope of the deliverance of his followers from this wrong belief . this chapter was mainly revealed in 57 a.h . however  v. 3  speaking of the perfection of religion in islam  was revealed during the holy prophet s last pilgrimage to makkah in 10 a.h . section 1  perfection of religion in islam in the name of allah  the beneficent  the merciful . 1 o you who believe  fulfil the obligations .  the cattle quadrupeds are allowed to you except what is recited to you  not violating the prohibition against game when you are on the pilgri mage .  surely allah orders what he pleases . 2 o you who believe  do not violate the signs of allah  c nor the a  11  respect for all covenants  contracts  agreements and treaties  all of which are included in the significance of the word uqud  and also of all divine ordinances  is the very first necessity of social relations . the word includes the covenants imposed by god as well as the mutual agreements made by people . thus respect for law  religious as well as temporal  is taught here . b  12  the prohibition against killing game during pilgrimage is mentioned in connection with the security of the kabah in verses 9496  so that even wild animals are secure during this time . c  21  the term shaair allah signifies all duties imposed by god on people . rites and ceremonies in connection with the pilgrimage and places where these ceremonies are performed are also known by this name . 138 53â « perfection of religion in islam 139 sacred month  nor the offerings  nor the victims with garlands   nor those repairing to the sacred house seeking the grace and pleasure of their lord . and when you are free from pilgrimage obligations  then hunt . and do not let hatred of a people â€ ” because they hindered you from the sacred mosque â€ ” incite you to transgress . and help one another in righteousness and piety  and do not help one another in sin and aggression  and keep your duty to allah .  surely allah is severe in retribution . 3 forbidden to you is what dies of itself  and blood  and flesh of swine  and that on which any other name than that of allah has been invoked  and the strangled  animal   and that beaten to death  and that killed by a fall  and that killed by goring with the horn  and what wild beasts have eaten â€ ” except what you slaughter  and what is sacrificed on stones set up  for idols   8 and  it is for bidden  that you seek to divide by arrows  that is a transgression . this day have those who disbelieve despaired of your religion  so do not fear them  and fear me . this day have i perfected for you your religion and completed my favour to you and chosen for you a  22  hady or  offering  means what is driven  to makkah  . qaldid or  victims with garlands  means necklaces or what is put upon the neck of an ani mal that is brought as an offering to makkah for sacrifice . only camels are made to wear garlands  while hady includes all kinds of animals brought as offering . b  23  the principle laid down here requires from muslims equal treatment for all nations  for those whom we hate as well as for those whom we love . only this principle of islam can serve as the basis for an international code for the modern world and an international law . c  24  editor s note  muslims ought only to cooperate with one another in matters of goodness  and are forbidden to help each other in wrongdoing against others . this injunction prohibits the evils of blind patriotism and unconditional support for one s own people even when they commit injustices against others . d  31  the meaning is that if an animal partly eaten by wild beasts is found while yet alive  and is slaughtered in the proper manner  its flesh is allowed . e  32  certain stones were set up around the kabah  over or near which it was customary for the idolaters to kill animals as offerings to certain idols .   33  this prohibits dividing the flesh of slaughtered animals by means of certain arrows with which the idolatrous arabs played a game of chance . 140 5 . food â « 54 islam as a religion . but whoever is compelled by hunger  not inclining wilfully to sin  then surely allah is forgiving  merciful . 4 they askyou as to what is allowed them . say  the good things are allowed to you  and what you have taught the beasts and birds of prey  training them to hunt â€ ” you teach them of what allah has taught you  so eat of what they catch for you and mention the name of allah over it  and keep your duty to allah . surely allah is swift in reckoning . 5 this day  all  good things are made lawful for you . and the food of those who have been given the book is lawful for you and your food is lawful for them . c and so are the chaste from among the believing women and the chaste from among those who have been given the book before you  when you give them their dowries  taking  them  in marriage  not fornicating nor taking them for lovers in secret . and whoever a  34  this verse was revealed towards the close of the holy prophet s life  and it is held by all authorities that no precept was revealed after this . it is a clear testimony to the perfection of religion in islam  no such claim being made by any other book or religion . just before the holy prophet muhammad  jesus had said   i still have many things to say to you  but you can not bear them now . however  when he  the spirit of truth  has come  he will guide you into all truth   john  161213  . the prophet muhammad was thus the last of the prophets  because religion being perfected  no prophet was needed after him . b  4  game killed by means of beasts and birds of prey taught to hunt is allowed . when the beast or the bird is sent after the prey  the name of allah should be mentioned . game killed by an arrow or by a shot is allowed  subject to the same condition . if the game is not killed before it falls into the hands of the hunter  it should be slaughtered  if it is already killed  it is lawful in that condition . c  51  thus animals slaughtered by the jews or the christians are allowed when slaughtered in the name of god . however  any food which is clearly prohi bited can not become lawful because it is offered by a jew or a christian . d  52  in islam intermarriages with idolworshippers are totally prohibited  2221   but in the case of a people whose religion is based on a revealed book  in which category fall almost all the nations of the world  the taking of their women in marriage is expressly allowed . the giving away of muslim women in marriage to followers of other religions is not  however  expressly mentioned  and practice from the earliest times is against it .  editor s note  a jewish or christian woman marrying a muslim man would enter a household where her prophets and scrip tures are believed in  while in the converse case a muslim woman would be entering a household where the prophet muhammad and the quran are not 56â « duty of uprightness 141 denies faith  his work indeed is fruitless  and in the hereafter he is among the losers . section 2  duty of uprightness 6 o you who believe  when you rise up for prayer  wash your faces  and your hands up to the elbows  and wipe your heads  and  wash  your feet up to the ankles . and if you are under an obliga tion   then wash  your body  . and if you are sick  or on a journey  or one of you has come from the toilet  or you have had  sexual  contact with women  and you can not find water  then resort to pure earth and wipe your faces and your hands with it . allah does not desire to place a burden on you but he wishes to purify you  and that he may complete his favour on you  so that you may give thanks . 7 and remember allah s favour on you and his covenant with which he bound you when you said  we have heard and we obey . and keep your duty to allah . surely allah is knower of what is in the hearts . 8 o you who believe  be upright for allah  bearers of witness with justice  and do not let hatred of a people incite you not to act equitably . be just  that is nearer to observance of duty . and keep your duty to allah . surely allah is aware of what you do . 9 auah has promised to those who believe and do good deeds  for them is forgiveness and a mighty reward . 10 and those who disbelieve and reject our messages  such are the companions of the flaming fire . 11 o you who believe  remember allah s favour on you when a people had determined to stretch out their hands against you  but he withheld their hands from you  and keep your duty to allah . and on allah let the believers rely . 6 believed in . also note that this verse allows a muslim man to marry a woman of the people of the book only under the condition that the two of them follow the same code of sexual morality as would apply if both of them were muslims .  a  6  i.e.  to perform a total ablution or bath after sexual intercourse . b  11  the enemies of islam tried to take away the life of the holy prophet and to exterminate the muslims on occasions too numerous to mention . 142 5 . food 512 section 3  christian violation of the covenant 12 and certainly allah made a covenant with the children of israel  and we raised up among them twelve chieftains .  and allah said  surely i am with you . if you keep up prayer and give the due charity and believe in my messengers and assist them and offer to allah a goodly gift  i will certainly cover your evil deeds  and make you enter gardens in which rivers flow . but whoever among you disbelieves after that  he indeed strays from the right way . 13 but on account of their breaking their covenant we cursed them and hardened their hearts . they alter words from their places and neglect a portion of what they were reminded of . and you will always discover treachery in them excepting a few of them â€ ” so pardon them and forgive . surely allah loves those who do good  to others  . 14 and with those who say  we are christians  we made a covenant  but they neglected a portion of what they were reminded of  so we stirred up enmity and hatred among them to the day of resurrection and allah will soon inform them of what they did . 15 o people of the book  indeed our messenger has come to you  making clear to you much of what you concealed of the book and passing over much . indeed  there has come to you from allah  a  12  see the bible  book of numbers  1516 and 144. b  141  the covenant  made through jesus  was to accept the prophet when he appeared . jesus told his followers   i still have many things to say to you  but you can not bear them now . however  when he  the spirit of truth  has come  he will guide you into all truth  for he will not speak on his own authority  but what ever he hears he will speak   john 161213  . c  142  the prophecy that there shall always be hatred and enmity between the various christian peoples has proved true in all ages  and never more clearly than in modern times with the world wars in europe . d  151  there were many truths which the jews and the christians had lost  their scriptures not having remained free from corruption  and many which were in their books but which they did not act upon . those which were of permanent value were revealed in the quran  but others â€ ” referred to in passing over much â€ ” that only suited the requirements of the earlier times were not now needed . 516  christian violation 143 a light and a clear book   16 by which allah guides such as follow his pleasure into the ways of peace  and brings them out of dark ness into light by his will  and guides them to the right path . 17 they indeed disbelieve who say  surely  allah â€ ” he is the messiah  son of mary . say  who then could control anything as against allah when he wished to destroy the messiah  son of mary  and his mother and all those on the earth  and allah s is the kingdom of the heavens and the earth and all that is between them . he creates what he pleases . and allah is powerful over all things . 18 and the jews and the christians say  we are the sons of allah and his beloved ones . c say  why does he then punish you for your sins  rather  you are mortals from among those whom he has created . he forgives whom he pleases and punishes whom he pleases .  and allah s is the kingdom of the heavens and the earth and all that is between them  and to him is the eventual coming . 19 people of the book  indeed our messenger has come to you explaining to you after a cessation of the messengers  6 in case you say  no bearer of good news came to us nor a warner . so indeed a bearer of good news and a warner has come to you . and allah is powerful over all things . a  152  the light is the holy prophet  and the book  the quran . b  17  the meaning is that jesus and mary  and all those who were then on the earth  tasted equally of death  hence jesus was a mortal and not god . c  181  in the gospels it is said   blessed are the peacemakers  for they shall be called the children of god   matthew  59  . the christians think they are the people spoken of here . the jews considered themselves as the favourite nation  because they thought they were the only nation chosen by god for the gift of divine revelation  to the exclusion of all other nations of the world . d  182  it is in accordance with divine laws that forgiveness and punish ment are exercised  and the alleged atonement of jesus brought no change in this . e  19  several centuries had elapsed since the appearance of any prophet in any country when the great arabian prophet made his appearance . no nation in the world claims the appearance of any messenger in it between the advent of jesus christ and that of the holy prophet muhammad . the world was  as it were  preparing itself for the advent of the greatest of all prophets  who was to be a messenger to all the nations of the world . 144 5 . food â€¢ 5  20 section 4  israelites  violation of the covenant 20 and when moses said to his people  my people  remember the favour of allah to you when he raised prophets among you and made you kings and gave you what he did not give to any other of the nations .  21 my people  enter the holy land which allah has ordained for you and do not turn your backs  for then you will turn back losers . 22 they said  moses  in it are a powerful people  and we shall not enter it until they go out from it  if they go out from it  then surely we will enter . 23 two men of those who feared  on whom allah had bestowed a favour  said  enter upon them by the gate  for when you enter it you will surely be victo rious  and put your trust in allah  if you are believers .  24 they said  moses  we will never enter it so long as they are in it  go therefore you and your lord  and fight  surely here we sit . 25 he said  my lord  i have control of none but my own self and my brother  so distinguish between us and the transgressing people . 26 he said  it will surely be forbidden to them for forty years â€ ” they will wander about in the land . e so do not grieve for the trans gressing people . section 5  cain and abel 27 and relate to them with truth the story of the two sons of adam  when they offered an offering  but it was accepted from one of them and was not accepted from the other . he said  i will certainly kill you .  the other  said  allah accepts only from the dutiful . 28 if you stretch out your hand against me to kill me i shall a  20  the reference need not be to the earlier history of the israelites  but to their history as dating from the time of moses  for the advent of moses had brought about an entire change both in their spiritual and political status . b  23  these were joshua and caleb . see numbers  1469. c  26  see numbers 1423 . the forty years spoken of here represent the life of that generation . d  27  the reference is apparently to the story of cain and abel . compare genesis 4312 . but the story may be taken allegorically  where the israelites may be taken for the aggressive and sinful brother and the ishmaelites  as represented by the holy prophet  for the righteous one . 5  29 â€¢ cain and abel 145 not stretch out my hand against you to kill you . surely i fear allah  the lord of the worlds  29 i would rather that you should bear the sin against me and your own sin  a thus you would be one of the companions of the fire  and that is the recompense of the unjust . 30 at length his mind made it easy for him to kill his brother  so he killed him  then he became one of the losers . 31 then allah sent a crow scratching the ground to show him how to cover the dead body of his brother . he said  woe is me  am i not able to be as this crow and cover the dead body of my brother  so he became regretful . 32 for this reason we prescribed for the children of israel that whoever kills a person  unless it is for manslaughter or for mischief in the land  it is as though he had killed all mankind . and whoever saves a life  it is as though he had saved the lives of all mankind . and certainly our messengers came to them with clear arguments  but even after that many of them commit excesses in the land . 33 the only punishment of those who wage war against allah and his messenger and strive to make mischief in the land c is that they should be murdered  or crucified  or their hands and their feet should be cut off on opposite sides  or they should be a  29  the words  the sin against me  are literally  my sin  but here mean the sin committed against me  i.e . the sin of murder . by  your sin  is meant his previous sin on account of which his offering was not accepted . the righteous brother tells the wicked one that even after knowing that he intended to kill him he would not be the first to raise his hand against him and kill him  but he would rather that the guilty one should go on adding to his sins . b  32  the reference is generally understood to be to the gravity of the crime of murder . c  331  this has generally been accepted as referring to armed robbers and murderers who cause disorder and loss of life and property in a settled state of society  and not to those who actually wage war . the punishment to be inflicted in any particular case would depend upon the circumstances of the case  as well as the time and place where the crime was committed .  editor s note  some recent commentators suggest that these words do not convey commands to apply these punishments as legal penalties  but describe the natural consequences that occur in society as a result of the actions of the perpetrators of such crimes .  146 5 . food â€¢ 5  34 imprisoned . this shall be a disgrace for them in this world  and in the hereafter they shall have a grievous punishment  34 except those who repent before you overpower them  so know that allah is forgiving  merciful . section 6  punishment of offenders 35 o you who believe  keep your duty to allah  and seek means of nearness to him  and strive hard in his way that you may be successful . 36 those who disbelieve  even if they had all that is in the earth  and as much as it again  to ransom themselves with it from the punishment of the day of resurrection  it would not be accepted from them  and theirs is a painful punishment . 37 they would desire to come forth from the fire  and they will not come forth from it  and theirs is a lasting punishment . 38 and  as for  the man and the woman addicted to theft  cut off their hands as a penalty for what they have earned â€ ” an exemplary punishment from allah . and allah is mighty  wise . 39 but whoever repents after his wrongdoing and reforms  allah will turn to him  mercifully  . surely allah is forgiving  merciful . 40 do you not know that allah is he to whom belongs the king dom of the heavens and the earth  he punishes whom he pleases  a  332  these words literally mean they should he banished from the earth  but are mostly accepted as meaning imprisonment . deportation is also included if we take  earth  as meaning a particular country . b  38  the cutting off of hands may be taken metaphorically or literally . if taken metaphorically  it would simply mean restraining the thief by imprisonment or otherwise . if taken literally  it must be emphasized that it is the maximum punishment  and whether it is inflicted would depend on the circumstances of the case . this punishment is called exemplary  and exemplary punishment could only be inflicted where the crime is very serious or the offender is a habitual criminal . the next verse shows that the punishment of cutting off the hand is only for a criminal who does not reform  i.e . for the habitual offender . moreover  what is required is repentance and reform . to give a man a chance to reform it is necessary that he should be given freedom of action before the more serious punishment is inflicted . i translate the word alsariq as meaning one addicted to theft  not only for the reasons given above but also because an explanatory read ing of this word is alsarriq  which is a noun of intensiveness  from the same root . 5  41 â€¢ quran and previous scriptures 147 and forgives whom he pleases . and allah is powerful over all things . 41 o messenger  do not let those grieve you who hasten to disbelief  from among those who say with their mouths  we believe  and their hearts do not believe  and from among those who are jews â€ ” they are listeners for the sake of a lie  listeners for another people who have not come to you .  they alter words after they are put in their  proper  places  saying  if you are given this  take it  and if you are not given this  be cautious . and he for whom allah intends temptation  you control nothing for him against allah . those are they whose hearts allah does not intend to purify . for them is disgrace in this world  and for them a grievous punishment in the hereafter . 42 listeners for the sake of a lie  devourers of forbidden things  so if they come to you  judge between them or turn away from them . and if you turn away from them  they can not harm you at all . and if you judge  judge between them with equity . surely allah loves the equitable . 43 and how do they make you a judge and they have the torah in which is allah s judgment  yet they turn away after that  and these are not believers . section 7  the quran and previous scriptures 44 surely we revealed the torah  having guidance and light . e a  41  the meaning is that they listen  but their object is only to invent lies and to give false reports to people who have not come to the holy prophet . b  42  by the agreement drawn up between the various nationalities of madinah on the advent of the holy prophet there  see 284 footnote   all disputes were to be referred to the holy prophet  but the jews had by this time become so inimical to the prophet that he is allowed to refuse to judge between them . in case he judged between them  he is still told to judge with equity . to be equitable  despite their severe enmity  shows that the prophet had reached the highest point of moral rectitude to which man can attain . c  441  verses 4447 do not provide evidence of the purity of the text of the bible as we have it . that the torah was a divine revelation containing light and guidance has never been denied . what is denied is that that light and guidance were kept intact throughout the ages . it is further denied that these two books were meant for the whole world and for all ages . 148 5 . food â€¢ 5  45 by it did the prophets who submitted themselves  to allah  judge for the jews  and the rabbis and the doctors of law  because they were required to guard the book of allah   and they were wit nesses of it . so do not fear the people and fear me  and do not take a small price for my messages . and whoever does not judge by what allah has revealed  those are the disbelievers . 45 and we prescribed to them in it that life is for life  and eye for eye  and nose for nose  and ear for ear  and tooth for tooth  and for wounds retaliation . but whoever forgoes it  it shall be an expiation for him . c and whoever does not judge by what allah has revealed  those are the wrongdoers . 46 and we sent after them in their footsteps jesus  son of mary  verifying what was  already  before him of the torah  and we gave him the gospel containing guidance and light  and verifying what was before it of the torah  and a guidance and an admonition for the dutiful . 47 and let the people of the gospel judge by what allah has revealed in it . and whoever does not judge by what allah has revealed  those are the transgressors . a  442  they were required to guard the book of god but nonetheless alterations were made in it as stated in 275 and 279. b  443  by judging is not meant only the judging of civil or criminal cases  but judging in all matters of religion  so that those who did not judge the revela tion of the holy prophet by what was revealed in the torah were disbelievers . the adoption of the words what allah has revealed instead of the torah is signifi cant . it shows that the whole of the torah as existing then was not looked upon by the quran as being the divine revelation . c  45  if a man forgoes his right to an act of reprisal against his brother  this shall be an expiation for any wrong he may have done . d  46  the description of the gospel as containing light and guidance conveys the same significance as the similar statement regarding the torah in v. 44 . in addition it is stated that the gospel verified the torah despite the fact that it introduces many new doctrines in place of those given in the mosaic law . this clearly shows that by verification is meant only corroboration of the general prin ciples and broad doctrines of the faith  such as the unity of god and equitable dealing with people  or the declaration by one prophet of the truth of a previous prophet  as the declaration of the truth of moses by jesus and of both by the holy prophet . it is in this sense that the quran is spoken of as verifying the torah and the gospel . 5  48 â€¢ quran and previous scriptures 149 48 and we have revealed to you the book with the truth  verifying what is  already  before it of the book and a guardian over it   so judge between them by what allah has revealed  and do not follow their low desires   turning away  from the truth that has come to you . for everyone of you we appointed a law and a way . and if allah had pleased he would have made you a single people  but that he might try you in what he gave you . e so vie with one another in good works . to allah you will all return  so he will inform you of that in which you differed  49 and that you should judge between them by what allah has revealed  and do not follow their low desires  and be cautious of them that they do not seduce you from part of what allah has revealed to you . then if they turn away  know that allah desires to afflict them for some of their sins . and surely many of the people are transgressors . 50 is it then the judgment of ignorance that they desire  and who is better than allah to judge for a people who are sure  a  481  being a guardian over all previous revelation shows that whatever was of permanent value in the previous scriptures has been preserved in the quran . the previous books contained a light and guidance for the people for whom they were meant  and they were commanded to judge by those books  but the quran is now the book which judges all truth  wherever it may have been . b  482  the appointment of a law and a way for everyone refers to the giving of different laws to different nations in accordance with their requirements before the revelation of the quran  which fulfilled the requirements of all nations and all ages . thus the quran here recognizes the principle to which it refers fre quently  that prophets were raised among every people  for which see particularly 1047  137 and 3524. c  483  one significance is that man is placed above the whole of creation in that he has been granted discretionary powers . hence  people follow different ways  adopting different sects . if man had not been granted these powers  all humans would have been a single people  but then man s better qualities would not have been manifested . the words may  however  also mean  if allah pleases he will make you a single people   referring to the ultimate destiny of the human race . in fact all people are now growing to the consciousness that they are all but one nation .  editor s note  these words  along with what follows in this verse  also indicate that all religions  though they are different  set before their adherents the same goal of doing good works  and therefore the followers of each religion should try to excel followers of other religions  or vie with them  in the doing of good works . that is how god tries adherents of every religion in this life .  150 5 . food â « 551 section 8  relations of muslims with enemies 51 o you who believe  do not take the jews and the christians for friends . they are friends of each other . and whoever among you takes them for friends he is indeed one of them . surely allah does not guide the unjust people .  52 but you see those in whose hearts is a disease  hastening towards them  saying  we fear that a calamity may befall us .  maybe allah will bring the victory or a commandment from himself so they will regret what they hid in their souls . 53 and those who believe will say  are these they who swore by allah with their most forcible oaths that they were surely with you  their deeds will be fruitless  so they will be losers . 54 o you who believe  if anyone of you should turn back from his religion  then allah will bring a people whom he loves and who love him  humble towards the believers  mighty against the disbelievers  striving hard in allah s way and not fearing the censure of any censurer . this is allah s grace â€ ” he gives it to whom he pleases . and allah is amplegiving  knowing . a  51  all nonbelievers  whatever their own differences  had made common cause against islam  this is what is meant by their being friends of each other . muslims are warned that they should not expect help or friendship from any party of them  whether jews  christians  or idolaters . it would have been weakness of faith in the ultimate triumph of islam if  from fear of a powerful enemy  they had sought help and friendship here and there among a hostile people  as the next verse shows . see 6079 which make it clear that the prohibition against friendly relations with the disbelievers was only temporary  to be operative only so long as the war continued . those verses settle conclusively that friendly relations between muslims and nonmuslims  as such  are not prohibited . b  521  by hastening towards them is meant hastening to make friendship with them or seeking their help  fearing a muslim reverse . c  522  bringing about a commandment refers to the establishment of the rule of islam  by which is meant the dominance of islam  there being a further reference to the spiritual conquests of islam in v. 54. d  54  muslims were severely persecuted while at makkah and their troubles at madinah increased manifold owing to the presence of warring tribes on all sides . yet they faced all these hardships with the greatest perseverance  and cases of apostasy were rare . 555  those who mock 151 55 0nly allah is your friend and his messenger and those who believe  those who keep up prayer and give the due charity  and they bow down . 56 and whoever takes allah and his messenger and those who believe for friend â€ ” surely the party of allah  they shall triumph . section 9  those who mock 57 o you who believe  do not take for friends those who take your religion as a mockery and a sport  from among those who were given the book before you and the disbelievers  and keep your duty to allah if you are believers .  58 and when you call to prayer they take it as a mockery and a sport . that is because they are a people who do not understand . 59 say  o people of the book  do you find fault with us for only that we believe in allah and in what has been revealed to us and what was revealed before  while most of you are trans gressors  60 say  shall i inform you of those worse than this in retribution from allah  they are those whom allah has cursed and upon whom he brought his wrath and of whom he made apes and swine  and who serve the devil . these are in a worse plight and further astray from the straight path . 61 and when they come to you  they say  we believe  and surely they come in unbelief and they go forth in it . and allah knows best what they conceal . 62 and you see many of them hastening to  commit  sin and trans gression  and their devouring unlawful gain . certainly evil is what they do . 63 why do not the rabbis and the doctors of law prohibit them from their sinful utterances and their devouring unlawful gain  certainly evil are the works they do . a  57  muslims were prohibited from having friendly relations with those who mocked their religion and their prophet . friendship with such people would indeed have led to a similar bent of mind .  editor s note  this again makes clear that friendship is only disallowed with disbelievers when they behave in a hostile way towards islam . muslims are nowhere required to attack physically or punish those who mock their religion  but only withdraw friendship temporarily .  b  63  editor s note  it is for their committing of evil deeds  the sins prohibi ted in their own scriptures  that the jews are here condemned . verses 65 and 66 152 5 . food â « 564 64 and the jews say  the hand of allah is tied up . their own hands are fettered and they are cursed for what they say . no  both his hands are spread out .  he disburses as he pleases . and what has been revealed to you from jour lord will certainly make many of them increase in inordinacy and disbelief . and we have cast among them enmity and hatred till the day of resurrection . whenever they kindle a fire for war allah puts it out  and they strive to make mischief in the land . and allah does not love the mischiefmakers . 65 and if the people of the book had believed and kept their duty we would certainly have removed from them their evils  and made them enter gardens of bliss . 66 and if they had observed the torah and the gospel and what is revealed to them from their lord  they would certainly have eaten from above them and from beneath their feet . some of them keep to the moderate course  but most of them â€ ” evil is what they do . e make it clear that jews and christians should not have violated the good teachings of their own scriptures and that there were some of them who did not . a  641  muslims as a community were mostly poor people who accepted the truth . jews on the other hand carried on business and were rich  hence they taunted muslims  saying that allah s hand was fettered . see also 3181 . the words  both his hands are spread out  indicate that god will enrich muslims materially as well as spiritually . b  642  the casting of enmity among them may relate to the enmity between the jews and the christians  because both are again and again referred to in this chapter .  editor s note  that enmity has existed throughout their history  culminating in the atrocities against the jews in europe in the 20th century .  c  66  if they had observed the torah and the gospel which contained clear prophecies of the prophet s advent  they would have believed in the revelation of the quran as well . the eating from above is in reference to spiritual blessings and eating from beneath their feet signifies the earthly provisions  i.e.  they would have had abundance of both . the attitude of liberality adopted by islam towards even its most implacable foes is remarkable . despite their strong enmity to islam  some jews and christians are described as keeping to the moderate course .  editor s note  it may also be meant that if jews and christians had acted on the moral teachings of their respective scriptures they would at least have not opposed the prophet muhammad  still less tried to destroy islam .  5  67 â€¢ christian deviation from the truth 153 section 10  christian deviation from the truth 67 o messenger  deliver what has been revealed to you from your lord  and if you do not  you have not delivered his message . and allah will protect you from people . surely allah does not guide the disbelieving people .  68 say  o people of the book  you follow no good till you observe the torah and the gospel and what is revealed to you from your lord . and surely what has been revealed to you from your lord will make many of them increase in inordinacy and dis belief  so do not grieve for the disbelieving people . 69 surely those who believe and those who are jews and the sabians and the christians â€ ” whoever believes in allah and the last day and does good â€ ” they shall have no fear nor shall they grieve . 70 certainly we made a covenant with the children of israel and we sent to them messengers . whenever a messenger came to them with what their souls did not desire  some  of them  they called liars and some they  even  sought to kill . 71 and they thought that there would be no affliction   so they became blind and deaf  then allah turned to them  mercifully  but many of them  again  became blind and deaf . c and allah is seer of what they do . a  67  the promise is given here that the holy prophet will remain under divine protection as against the innumerable dangers that threatened him from all quarters and the numerous plots against his life . but it also refers to the prophet  s spiritual protection . god protects prophets by creating them pure from every sin in their very nature  keeping them firm in trials  sending down tranquillity upon them and protecting their hearts against evil . b  711  although they had been repeatedly warned of the afflictions which would befall them  they still thought that  being a favoured nation  they would not suffer punishment for their evil deeds . they had been subjected to great sufferings at the hands of nebuchadnezzar and the babylonian rulers who followed him  large numbers having been slain and the rest taken prisoners . and again they suf fered at the hands of titus . see v. 78 where this affliction is spoken of as coming after david and jesus . c  712  allah s turning mercifully to them signifies the advent of jesus  and their becoming blind and deaf a second time refers to their rejection of him . 154 5 . food â « 572 72 certainly they disbelieve who say  allah  he is the messiah  son of mary . and the messiah said  o children of israel  serve allah  my lord and your lord .  surely whoever sets up partners with allah  allah has forbidden to him the garden and his abode is the fire . and for the wrongdoers there will be no helpers . 73 certainly they disbelieve who say  allah is the third of the three . and there is no god but one god . and if they do not refrain from what they say  a painful punishment will surely befall such of them as disbelieved 74 will they not then turn to allah and ask his forgiveness  and allah is forgiving  merciful . 75 the messiah  son of mary  was only a messenger â€ ” messengers had indeed passed away before him . and his mother was a truthful woman . they both used to eat food . see how we make the messages clear to them  then see how they are turned away  from truth   76 say  do you serve besides allah that which controls for you neither harm nor benefit  and allah â€ ” he is the hearing  the knowing . 77 say  o people of the book  do not exaggerate in the matter of your religion unjustly  nor follow the a  72   you shall worship the lord your god  and him only you shall serve   matthew  410  . b  731  the wellknown christian doctrine of the trinity is here plainly referred to . it should be noted that the name of mary is never mentioned in connection with the doctrine of the trinity . but as the christians  especially the roman catholics  invested mary with divine character  as being the mother of god  the quran often mentions her along with jesus as being an ordinary mortal . c  732  the doctrine of the atonement has slowly and gradually made the christian world forget god altogether  and material advancement and the acquisition of worldly power has become their only concern . they first sought to subjugate the whole world  and  having done that  they are now seeking to overpower each other . their mutual hatred and enmity as a punishment for their violation of the covenant of god has been already clearly spoken of in v. 14  and again in v. 64  as also in an earlier revelation   and on that day we shall let some of them surge against others   1899  . d  75  feeling hungry and partaking of food shows that both jesus and his mother were ordinary mortals . every living thing needs food  it is only the supreme being who has no need of it . as jesus is clearly spoken of as eating food while alive  he could not remain alive without food  and this verse thus negatives the allegation that jesus is still alive . 5  78 â€¢ christian nearness to islam 155 low desires of people who went astray before and led many astray  and went astray from the right path . a section 1 1  christian nearness to islam 78 those who disbelieved from among the children of israel were cursed by the tongue of david and jesus  son of mary . this was because they disobeyed and exceeded the limits . 79 they did not forbid one another the hateful things they did . evil indeed was what they did . 80 ybu see many of them befriending those who disbelieve . certainly evil is what their souls send ahead for them  so that allah is displeased with them  and in punishment will they abide . 81 and if they believed in allah and the prophet c and what is revealed to him  they would not take them for friends  but most of them are transgressors . 82 fou will certainly find the most violent of people in enmity against the believers to be the jews and the idolaters  and you will find the nearest in friendship to the believers to be those who say  we are christians . that is because a  77  the exaggeration spoken of here refers to the christian doctrine raising a mortal to the dignity of godhead . the christians are here told that in making this doctrine the basis of their religion they have only followed an erro neous doctrine preached by people before them . recent criticism has shown that the christians have only followed previous idolatrous nations in ascribing a son to god . this subject has been fully discussed in the sources of christianity by the late khwaja kamaluddin . b  78  after moses  david and jesus  who represent the highest achievement of israelite prophethood in temporal and spiritual glory  spoke of the advent of the holy prophet in unmistakable terms . the curse is used here in its original sense of being removed further off from divine mercy . both prophets had warned the jews that their transgressions called for divine punishment which should soon overtake them if they did not mend their ways . the time of both was followed by a great affliction overtaking the jews  in the respective depredations of the babylonian kings and the destruction wrought by titus . c  81  by alnabl or the prophet in the quran is always meant the holy prophet muhammad  and he is often spoken of and addressed as alnabi or al rasul  the prophet or the messenger . in fact  he is referred to as the prophet or that prophet in earlier prophecy as well  john 121 25  . the jews professed belief in the unity of god  yet they made a common cause with the idolatrous quraish to uproot islam which was a religion of pure monotheism . 156 5 . food â « 583 there are priests and monks among them and because they are not proud .  83 and when they hear what has been revealed to the messenger you see their eyes overflow with tears because of the truth they recognize . they say  our lord  we believe  so write us down with the witnesses .  84 and what  reason  have we that we should not believe in allah and in the truth that has come to us  while we earnestly desire that our lord should make us enter with the righteous people  85 so allah rewarded them for what they said  with gardens in which rivers flow  to abide in them . and that is the reward of the doers of good . 86 and those who dis believe and reject our messages  such are the companions of the flaming fire . section 12  warning of sins of previous people 87 o you who believe  do not forbid the good things which allah has made lawful for you  nor exceed the limits . surely allah a  82  the christians were nearer to islam than the jews  not only because the muslims accepted jesus as a prophet of god  but because there were still among them many people who feared and worshipped god . in the holy prophet s own time  the negus  christian emperor of abyssinia  accepted islam  heraclius  the byzantine ruler  was favourably disposed towards it  and even the christian deputation of najran towards the end of the prophet s life was impressed with the prophet s arguments . but the words here are more of a prophetical nature . in the early history of islam  christians in egypt  north africa  syria  persia and other countries  accepted islam in very large numbers and at present  too  when islam is being presented to the west  the christians are receiving the message with an open heart . b  83  this refers to the christians who believed . an important such person age was the negus of abyssinia  in whose dominions the muslims found shelter in the early days of the prophet s mission  when compelled to flee from makkah on account of the severe persecutions of the quraish . when the portion of the chapter of the quran entitled mary  dealing with jesus christ was read out to him  the words so impressed him that he wept and said that jesus was not one whit more than the quran described him to be . that he subsequently became a true convert to islam is clearly shown by a funeral service having been held for him by the holy prophet when news of his death reached madinah . 588  warning of sins of previous people 157 does not love those who exceed the limits .  88 and eat of the lawful and good  things  that allah has given you  and keep your duty to allah  in whom you believe . 89 allah will not call you to account for what is vain in your oaths  but he will call you to account for the making of deliberate oaths  so its expiation is the feeding often poor persons with the average  food  you feed your families with  or their clothing  or the freeing of a slave . but whoever does not find  means  should fast for three days . this is the expiation of your oaths when you swear . and keep your oaths . thus does allah make clear to you his messages that you may give thanks . 90 o you who believe  intoxicants and games of chance and  sacrificing to  stones set up and  dividing by  arrows e are only an uncleanness  the devil s work  so shun it that you may succeed 91 the devil desires only to create enmity and hatred among you by means of intoxicants and games of chance  and to keep you back from the remembrance of allah and from prayer . will you then keep back  e 92 and obey allah and obey the messenger and a  87  muslims are told on the one hand not to follow the selfimposed restrictions of christian monks and priests  and at the same time they are warned against depriving themselves of divine blessings by falling into evil habits . b  89  the oaths referred to are in relation to vows  etc.  by which one forbids oneself what is otherwise lawful . the injunction at the end of this verse  keep your oaths  also shows that oaths can not be violated generally  and therefore expiation is only allowed in the case of oaths by which a person deprives himself of some lawful thing or of an occasion of virtue  as in 2226. c  901  for  stones set up  and  dividing by arrows  see 53 footnotes 2 and 3. d  902  this verse totally prohibits all intoxicants and games of chance  and besides  by classing them with sacrifices to stones set up for idols and dividing by arrows  subjects them to the prohibition of 53 . it is related that when this verse was revealed a crier proclaimed in the streets of madinah that wine was prohibi ted  and in response to this every jar of wine in a muslim house was emptied  so that wine flowed in the streets  bukhari  4620  . never in the history of the world was such a deeprooted evil as drink so suddenly yet so completely eradicated . e  91  only one very clear reason is here given why intoxicants and games of chance are forbidden . elsewhere it is clearly stated that in intoxicants and games of chance there is a great sin  2219  . 158 5 . food 593 be cautious . but if you turn back then know that the duty of our messenger is only to deliver the message clearly . 93 0n those who believe and do good there is no blame for what they eat  a when they keep their duty and believe and do good deeds  then keep their duty and believe  then keep their duty and do good  to others  . and allah loves the doers of good . section 13  inviolability of the kabah 94 o you who believe  allah will certainly try you in respect of some game which your hands and your lances can reach  that allah may know who fears him in secret . whoever exceeds the limit after this  for him is a painful punishment . 95 you who believe  do not kill game while you are on pilgrimage .  and who ever among you kills it intentionally  the compensation of it is the like of what he killed  from the cattle  as two just persons among you judge  as an offering to be brought to the kabah  or the expiation of it is the feeding of the poor or equivalent of it in fasting  that he may taste the unwholesome result of his deed . allah pardons what happened in the past . and whoever returns  to it   allah will punish him . and allah is mighty  lord of retri bution . 96 lawful to you is the game of the sea and its food  e a provision for you and for the travellers  and the game of the land is forbidden to you so long as you are on pilgrimage  and keep your duty to allah  to whom you shall be gathered . a  93  the verse speaks of those who died before the prohibition came . but even if it is taken generally  it would not justify doing what is unlawful  because one who believes  does good deeds  and keeps his duty will not approach any pro hibited thing . in three times mentioning belief and regard for duty  the reference is to the threefold duty of man  viz.  to allah  to himself  and to others . b  95  the prohibition to kill game when on pilgrimage  mentioned in verses 9496  is a token of respect for the security of the kabah  see v. 97   in addition to being a measure necessary for the safety of life in such a large gathering . c  96  by the game of the sea is meant all water game  whether sea  river  pond  or lake . the food of the sea is here distinguished from its game  and means what is found having been left by the sea or river on dry land  without needing to be caught . 5  97 â€¢ inviolability of the kabah 159 97 allah has made the kabah  the sacred house   a means of support for the people  and the sacred month and the offerings and the victims with garlands . that is that you may know that allah knows whatever is in the heavens and whatever is in the earth  and that allah is knower of all things . 98 know that allah is severe in retribution and that allah is forgiving  merciful .  the duty of the messenger is only to deliver the message . and allah knows what you do openly and what you hide . 100 say  the bad and the good are not equal  though the abundance of the bad may make you wonder . so keep your duty to allah  you people of understanding  that you may succeed . section 14  some directions for muslims 101 o you who believe  do not ask about things which  if made known to you  would give you trouble  and if you ask about them when the quran is being revealed  they will be made known to you . allah pardons this  and allah is forgiving  forbearing 102 a people before you indeed asked such questions  then became disbelievers in them . a  971  the word ka bah comes from the root meaning it swelled or became prominent  and it is so called because of its prominence  or it is a pro phetical name showing that it shall forever have eminence in the world . albait alharam  the sacred or inviolable house   used here  is also one of its names  and among the arabs it was known as bait allah  or the house of allah . b  972  this is a prophetic announcement that the kabah will forever remain a support or stay for mankind  where pilgrims will flock from all parts of the world . the words  that is that you may know that allah knows whatever is in the heavens and whatever is in the earth  indicate that the fulfilment of this pro phecy in all future ages will be a sign of the great knowledge of allah  who pronounced it at a time when the kabah was hardly known beyond the borders of arabia  see 397. c  101  islam prohibited questions relating to details on many points which would require this or that practice to be made obligatory  and much was left to individual will or the circumstances of the time and place . the exercise of judg ment occupies a very important place in islam and this gives ample scope to different nations and communities to frame laws for themselves to meet new and changed situations . the holy prophet also discouraged questions on details in which a muslim could choose a way for himself . 160 5 . food 5103 103 allah has not ordained a bahirah or a sdibah or a wasilah or a zawz   but those who disbelieve fabricate a lie against allah .  and most of them do not understand . 104 and when it is said to them  come to what allah has revealed and to the messen ger  they say  sufficient for us is that on which we found our fathers . what  even though their fathers knew nothing and had no guidance  105 o you who believe  take care of your souls â€ ” he who goes astray can not harm you when you are on the right way . to allah you will all return  so he will inform you of what you did . 106 o you who believe  call to witness between you  when death draws near to one of you  at the time of making the will  two just persons from among you  or two others from among others than you  if you are travelling in the land and the calamity of death befalls you . you should detain them after the prayer . then if you doubt  them   they shall both swear by allah  saying   we will not take for it a price even for a relative  nor will we hide the testimony of allah  c for then certainly we shall be sinners . 107 if it is discovered that they are guilty of a sin  two others shall stand up in their place from among those against whom the first two have been guilty of a sin  so they shall swear by allah  certainly our testimony is truer than the testimony of those two  and we have not exceeded the limit  for then surely we should be unjust . 108 thus it is more probable that they will give true testimony or fear that other oaths will be taken after their oaths . and keep your duty to allah and listen . and allah does not guide the trans gressing people . a  103  the liberation of certain animals in honour of idols was a practice among the arabs  and as islam uprooted every vestige of idolatry  this practice is condemned here . the terms bahirah  sdibah  wasilah and hami referred to vari ous types of camels and goat . b  1061  the words  others than you  show that the evidence of the follow ers of other religions is admissible according to the quran  who may be chosen as witnesses by muslims . c  1062   the testimony of allah  stands for the testimony which allah has enjoined to be borne uprightly . 5109  christian love of the material life 1 6 1 section 15  christian love of the material life 109 on the day when allah will gather together the messen gers and say  what was the response you received  they will say  we have no knowledge . surely you are the great knower of the unseen 110 when allah will say  o jesus  son of mary  remember my favour to you and to your mother  when i strengthened you with the holy spirit  you spoke to people in the cradle and in old age  and when i taught you the book and the wisdom and the torah and the gospel  and when you determined out of clay a thing like the form of a bird by my permission  then you breathed into it and it became a bird by my permission  and you healed the blind and the leprous by my permission  and when you raised the dead by my permission  and when i withheld the children of israel from you when you came to them with clear arguments â€ ” but those of them who disbelieved said  this is nothing but clear enchantment . ill and when i revealed to the disciples  saying  believe in me and my messenger  they said  we believe  and  ask you to  bear witness that we are submitting ones . 112 when the disciples said  jesus  son of mary  is jour lord able to send down food â° to us from heaven  he said  keep your duty to allah if you are believers . 113 they said  we desire to eat of it  and that our hearts should be satisfied  and that we may know that you have indeed spoken truth to us  and that we may be witnesses of it . 114 jesus  son of mary  said  o allah  our lord  send down to us food from a  109  only allah knew how their message was received  because they could not say how far its rejecters were guilty  nor how far the accepters of the message remained true to it after their death . b  110  for being strengthened with the holy spirit  see 287 footnote  for speaking in the cradle and in old age  see 346 footnote  for the miracles spoken of here  see 349 footnotes  for the withholding of the israelites  see 35455 foot notes . c  112  the word mdidah  also the title of this chapter  means both a table with food on it and food . it also means knowledge  because knowledge is the nourishment for hearts  as food is the nourishment for bodies . 162 5 . food 5115 heaven which should be to us an everrecurring happiness  to the first of us and the last of us  and a sign from you  and give us sus tenance and you are the best of the sustainers . 115 allah said  surely i will send it down to you  but whoever disbelieves after wards from among you  i will punish him with a punishment with which i will not punish anyone among the nations f section 16  false doctrines introduced after jesus  death 116 and when allah will say  o jesus  son of mary  didyou say to people  take me and my mother for two gods besides allah    he will say  glory be to you  it was not for me to say a  1141  the word id used here means a festival  the literal significance being an everrecurring happiness or source of enjoyment . b  1142  this passage seems to refer to the wellknown prayer for daily bread  which jesus appears to have included in the famous lord s prayer on account of the earthly inclinations of his disciples . the food of the earth has no doubt been granted in abundance to christians  but this has deprived them of the heavenly food . the muslim s prayer in the opening chapter of the quran craves not for bread but for the right path . the form of the prayer here  that it should be an everrecurring happiness  shows clearly that the prayer was not for a table laden with provisions  as is generally supposed . as to its being sent down from heaven  it should be borne in mind that  in the language of the quran  everything is with god and is sent down to people  see 1521. c  115  the terrible calamities which the two world wars brought to huma nity  and especially to the christian nations  are unprecedented in human history . the calamities which have befallen the world today are due to the mad race for bread and for the wealth of this world . the neglect of the higher values of life and running blindly after material comforts has already brought to the world a ruin which it has never witnessed before . rf  116  from this description of mary being taken for a god by christians  some critics of the quran conclude that it has mistakenly considered the trinity to consist of the three persons â€ ” god  jesus and mary . however  the doctrine of the trinity is not mentioned here  while the divinity of mary is not mentioned where the quran speaks of the trinity . see 4171 footnote 3 and 573 footnote 1 . as to mary being taken for a god  the catechism of the roman church includes the following doctrines   that she is truly the mother of god  and the second eve  by whose means we have received blessing and life  that she is the mother of pity and very specially our advocate  that her images are of the utmost utility   encyclopaedia britannica  llthed.  vol . 17  p. 813  . 5117  false doctrines introduced 163 what i had no right to  say  . if i had said it  you would indeed have known it . you know what is in my mind  and i do not know what is in your mind . surely you are the great knower of the unseen . 117 i said to them nothing but what you commanded me  serve allah  my lord and your lord  and i was a witness of them so long as i was among them  but when you caused me to die you were the watcher over them . and you are witness of all things .  m if you punish them  surely they are your servants  and if you protect them  surely you are the mighty  the wise . 119 allah will say  this is a day when their truth will profit the truthful ones . for them are gardens in which rivers flow  abiding therein forever . allah is well pleased with them and they are well pleased with allah . that is the mighty achievement . 120 auah s is the kingdom of the heavens and the earth and whatever is in them  and he is powerful over all things . a  117  this verse is a conclusive proof that jesus died a natural death  and is not now alive in heaven . here jesus says that so long as he was among his followers he was a witness of their condition  and he did not find them holding the belief in his divinity . the logical conclusion of this statement is that the false doctrine of his divinity was introduced into the christian faith after his death  after  you caused me to die   see further 355 footnote 1 . a saying of the holy prophet is recorded in which the holy prophet speaks concerning himself in the very words which are here put into the mouth of jesus . he said that he would be shown on the day of resurrection some of his followers who had gone against his teachings  and  i would say what the righteous servant said  i was a witness of them so long as i was among them  but when you caused me to die  you were the watcher over them   bukhari  608  . b  118  the words tagkfir lahum  protect them ox forgive them  refer to their final protection which will be granted to the christian nations through accep tance of islam . if the forgiveness of sins was meant  the divine attributes referred to would have been those speaking of forgiveness and mercy  as the forgiving  the merciful . instead of that the attributes referred to are the mighty  the wise  which generally indicate that some great purpose would be achieved and a trans formation would be brought about . chapter 6 alanam cattle the name of this chapter refers to certain superstitious and idolatrous practices of the preislamic arabs  v. 142144  which were to be abolished to establish the doctrine of divine unity . the chapter deals with this doctrine at length  presents evidence to prove its truth and declares its ultimate triumph over idolatry and all other kinds of polytheism . this chapter was revealed at makkah in the last year of the phase of the holy prophet s life there . section 1  ultimate triumph of divine unity in the name of allah  the beneficent  the merciful . 1 praise be to allah  who created the heavens and the earth  and made darkness and light . yet those who disbelieve set up equals to their lord .  2 he it is who created you from clay  then he decreed a term . and there is a term named with him  still you doubt .  3 and he is allah in the heavens and in the earth . he knows your secret  thoughts  and your open  words   and he knows what you earn .  a  1  the words that allah is the maker of darkness and light are directed against the dualistic doctrine of the magian religion  which holds light and dark ness to be two coeternal principles . the religion of islam is the purest mono theism  and thus it holds that the ultimate cause of all things is the great maker of the heavens and the earth . pure monotheism holds out before mankind the bright hope that  as goodness is inherent in the divine being  it is also the goal to which the creation moves on  while dualism considers the prevalence of evil to be necessary . b  2  the first term is that of life and the second the resurrection . all humans are here said to be created from clay  which means  in the case of adam as well as human beings generally  that the earth is the original source  and dust the first stage  of life . c  3  life in resurrection  spoken of in the previous verse  is here stated to be the result of man s own actions  which  whether done secretly or openly  are known to god . it is out of what you earn that he shapes a new life for you . 164 6  4 â€¢ ultimate triumph of divine unity 1 65 4 and no message comes to them of the messages of their lord but they turn away from it . 5 so they rejected the truth when it came to them  but soon will come to them the news of what they mocked . 6 do they not see how many a generation we destroyed before them  whom we had established in the earth as we have not established you  and we sent clouds pouring abundant rain on them  and we made rivers flow beneath them  then we des troyed them for their sins  and raised up after them another generation . 7 and if we had sent down to you a writing on paper  then they had touched it with their hands  those who disbelieve would have said  this is nothing but clear enchantment .  8 and they say  why has not an angel been sent down to him  and if we send down an angel  the matter would be decided and then they would not be given respite . 9 and if we had made him an angel  we would certainly have made him a man  and  thus  made confused to them what they confuse . c 10 and messengers before you were indeed mocked  but that which they derided befell those of them who scoffed a  7  if truth had been sent down to man in the physical form of a book  and had not been revealed to the mind of man  it could not bring about a transforma tion in the minds of human beings . but even if it had taken a physical shape  they would have called it an enchantment  and still rejected it . b  8  they wanted to see the spiritual reality of the angel in a physical form . the presence of angels was felt by the righteous in the transformation which they worked in their hearts but the hearts of the wicked were impervious to all good  and hence the only form in which the angels could make their presence felt to them was by punishing them for their evil deeds . hence the coming of the angels to the guilty is always spoken of in the quran as being synonymous with the infliction of the punishment with which they were threatened . compare 2210 and v. 158 of this chapter . c  9  if an angel were made a messenger to mankind  he would doubtless appear in the form of a man as the physical eye can not see angels . thus there would still be the same confusion in their minds as when a human being was en trusted with the divine message . moreover only a human being could serve as a model for people . d  10  they ridiculed the idea of the prophet and the believers being trium phant . truth had always triumphed  they are told  and it would triumph even now . 166 6 . cattle 611 section 2  greatness of divine mercy 11 say  travel in the land  then see what was the end of the rejectors . 12 say  to whom belongs whatever is in the heavens and the earth  say  to allah . he has ordained mercy on himself .  he will certainly gather you on the day of resurrection â€ ” there is no doubt about it . those who have lost their souls  they will not believe . 13 and to him belongs whatever dwells in the night and the day . and he is the hearing  the knowing . 14 say  shall i take for a friend other than allah  the origina tor of the heavens and the earth  and he feeds and is not fed  say  i am commanded to be the first of those who submit . and do not be of those who set up partners  with allah  . 15 say  surely i fear  if i disobey my lord  the punishment of a grievous day . 16 he from whom it is averted on that day  allah indeed has had mercy on him . and this is a manifest achievement . 17 and if allah touch you with affliction  there is none to remove it but he . and if he touch you with good  he is powerful over all things . 18 and he is the supreme  above his servants . and he is the wise  the aware . 19 say  what thing is of most weight in testimony  say  allah is witness between you and me . and this quran has been revealed to me that with it i may warn you and whomsoever it reaches . c do you really bear witness that there are other gods with allah  say  i do not bear witness . say  he is only one god  and surely i am innocent of what you set up  with him  . 20 those whom we have given the book recognize him as they recognize their sons . those who have lost their souls  they will not believe . a  12  the words he has ordained mercy on himself imply that mercy is in fact his very nature . the evidence of divine mercy is manifest in the physical world  he has created all things for the benefit of man . would he not deal equally mercifully with man in his spiritual needs and send a revelation to guide him  b  17  the meaning is  allah  being allpowerful  will bring good to you . c  19  the holy prophet was thus a warner  not for the arabs only  but for all people whom the quran may reach  i.e . for the whole world . d  20  for as they recognize their sons  see 2  146 and footnote . 621  polytheists  witness against themselves 167 section 3  polytheists  witness against themselves 21 and who is more unjust than one who forges a lie about allah  or calls his messages a lie  surely the wrongdoers will not be successful . 22 and on the day we gather them all together  then we shall say to those who set up partners  with allah   where are your associategods whom you asserted  23 then their excuse would be nothing but that they would say  by allah  our lord  we did not set up partners . 24 see how they lie against their own souls  and what they forged shall fail them  25 and some of them listen to you and we have cast veils over their hearts so that they do not understand it and a deafness into their ears . and  even  if they see every sign they will not believe in it . a so much so that when they come to you they only dispute with you â€ ” those who disbelieve say  this is nothing but stories of the ancients . 26 and they forbid  others  from it  and they keep away from it  and they ruin none but their own souls while they do not per ceive . 27 and if you could see when they are made to stand before the fire  and say  if only we were sent back  we would not reject the messages of our lord but would be from among the believers . 28 no  what they concealed before will become manifest to them . and if they were sent back  they would certainly go back to what they are forbidden  and surely they are liars . 29 and they say  there is nothing but our life of this world and we shall not be raised again . 30 and if you could see when they are made to stand before their lord  he will say  is not this the truth  they will say  certainly  by our lord  he will say  taste then the punishment because you disbelieved . a  25  veils were cast over their hearts because they would not believe even if they saw all the signs . as the words that follow show  they came to the prophet  not for the purpose of listening to and pondering over what he said  but to dispute with him . the veils were due to their own actions  see 210 and footnote . b  28  the evil consequences of their deeds were hidden in this life  but they will become manifest in the life after death . and since  if they were sent back  the evil consequences of evil deeds would again be hidden from the physical eye they would revert to evil deeds . 168 6 . cattle 631 section 4  rejection of the truth 31 they are losers indeed who reject the meeting with allah  until when the hour comes upon them suddenly   they will say  o our grief for our neglecting it  and they bear their burdens on their backs . now surely evil is what they bear  32 and this world s life is but an idle sport and play . and certainly the abode of the hereafter is better for those who keep their duty . do you not then understand  33 we know indeed that what they say grieves you  for surely they do not call you a liar  but the wrongdoers deny the messages of allah . 34 and messengers indeed were rejected before you  but they were patient when rejected and persecuted  until our help came to them . and there is none to change the words of allah . c and there has already come to you some information about the messengers . 35 and if their turning away is hard on you  then  if you can  seek an opening into the earth or a ladder to heaven  to bring them a sign   and if allah pleased  he would certainly have gathered them all to guidance  so do not be from among the igno rant . 36 0nly those accept who listen . and  as for  the dead  allah will raise them  then to him they will be returned . 6 a  31  by the hour is meant their doom  as well as the hour of the final judg ment . b  33  the holy prophet was known among them as alamln  i.e.  the faithful or the truthful one . his worst enemies at the height of their enmity admitted that he had never told a lie . it was after he received the divine revelation that he was called a liar  and hence it was really a denial of the divine revelation  not a denial as to the prophet s truthfulness . c  34  the context shows that by the words of allah here are meant the prophecies foretelling the triumph of truth and the overthrow of all opposition . d  35  by sign is meant a sign that should bring all to guidance . their doom was pronounced  and that word must be fulfilled  as affirmed in the previous verse  but the demand of the people to be overawed into an immediate submission to the prophet by a sign was not in accordance with the divine law . e  36  those addressed by the holy prophet are here divided into two classes   1  those who listen  they accept him and become believers   2  those who are spiritually dead and pay no heed to his warning . even the latter are not to be despaired of  for allah will raise them too to spiritual life . their being returned to allah stands here for their ultimate acceptance of the truth . 6  37 â€¢ consequences of rejection 169 37 and they say  why has not a sign been sent down to him from his lord  say  surely allah is able to send down a sign  but most of them do not know .  38 and there is no animal in the earth  nor a bird that flies on its two wings  but  they are  communities like yourselves . we have not neglected anything in the book . then to their lord will they be gathered . 39 and those who reject our messages are deaf and dumb  in darkness . whom allah pleases he leaves in error . and whom he pleases he places on the right way . 40 say  see  if the punishment of allah overtake you or the hour come upon you  will you call on others than allah  if you are truthful  41 no  him you call upon  so he removes that for which you pray  if he pleases  and you forget what you set up as partners  with him  . section 5  consequences of rejection 42 and indeed we sent  messengers  to nations before you then we seized them with distress and affliction that they might humble themselves . 43 yet why did they not  when our punishment came to them  humble themselves  but their hearts hardened and the devil made all that they did seem good to them . 44 then  when they neglected what they had been admonished with  we opened for them the gates of all things . c until  when they rejoiced in what they were given  we seized them suddenly  then they were in a  37  allah did send the very sign demanded  as we find the arabs sub mitting to the holy prophet almost in a body after the conquest of makkah . b  38  other creatures are all provided for by allah as human beings are  so far as physical needs are concerned . but man s nature aspires to something higher  and it is to satisfy that spiritual craving that prophets are sent . this verse  more over  points  as it were  to two classes of people â€ ” those who  like beasts  are wholly bent on earth and can not rise  and those who rise like birds  soaring upward to the higher spiritual regions . the concluding words of the verse â€ ” then to their lord will they be gathered â€ ” are in reference to mankind and  as com pared with other animals  point to the higher life  the life eternal in god . there is no mention here or anywhere else in the quran of the lower animals being raised to a new life for judgment . c  44  by opening the gates of all things is meant that all comforts of life were made accessible to them . 170 6 . cattle 645 utter despair  45 so the roots of the people who did wrong were cut off . and praise be to allah  the lord of the worlds .  46 say  have you considered that if allah should take away your hearing and your sight and seal your hearts  who is the god besides allah that can bring it to you  see how we repeat the messages yet they turn away  47 say  see  if the punishment of allah should overtake you suddenly or openly  will any be des troyed but the wrongdoing people  48 and we do not send messengers but as bearers of good news and warners  then whoever believes and acts aright  they shall have no fear  nor shall they grieve . 49 and as for those who reject our messages  punishment will afflict them because they transgressed . 50 say  i do not say to you  i have with me the treasures of allah  nor do i know the unseen  nor do i say to you that i am an angel  i follow only what is revealed to me . say  are the blind and the seeing alike  do you not then reflect  section 6  reward of believers 51 and warn with it those who fear that they will be gathered to their lord â€ ” there is no protector for them  nor any intercessor besides him â€ ” so that they may keep their duty . 52 and do not drive away those who call upon their lord  morning and evening  desiring only his pleasure . neither are you accountable for them at all  nor are they accountable for you at all  that you should drive them away and thus be one of the wrongdoers . c 53 and thus do we a  45  by cutting off the roots is meant the destruction of the ringleaders in particular . b  50  appearing among a superstitious and ignorant people  the holy prophet could have claimed any supernatural powers for himself . but he told them plainly that he was a man who had no treasures  nor did he lay claim as a man to know the secrets of the future  nor did he profess to be any more than a mortal . allah had revealed his will to him  and he faithfully followed and translated into practice everything that he received from on high . and as he himself was  so he wanted others to be . the unique greatness of the prophet lies in the fact that he never tried to put himself before people as superhuman . c  52  this verse was revealed when some leading quraish expressed their 654  divine judgment 171 try some of them by others so that they say  are these they upon whom allah has conferred benefit from among us   does not allah best know the grateful  54 and when those who believe in our messages come to you  say  peace be on you  your lord has ordained mercy on himself   so  that if anyone of you does evil in ignorance  then turns after that and acts aright  then he is for giving  merciful . 55 and thus do we make distinct the messages so that the way of the guilty may become clear . section 7  divine judgment 56 say  i am forbidden to serve those whom you call upon besides allah . say  i do not follow your low desires  for then indeed i should go astray and should not be of the guided ones . 57 say  surely i have manifest proof from my lord and you call it a lie . i do not have with me  the power to bring  what you seek to hasten . the judgment is only allah s . he relates the truth and he is the best of deciders . 58 say  if i had with me  the power to bring  what you seek to hasten  the matter would have certainly been decided between you and me . and allah best knows the wrongdoers . 59 and with him are the treasures of the unseen â€ ” none knows them but he . and he knows what is in the land and the sea . and no leaf falls but he knows it  nor is there a grain in the darkness of the earth  nor anything green or dry  but  it is all  in a clear book . 60 and he it is who takes your souls at night  and he willingness to accept the prophet if the poorer muslims were not allowed to remain in his company at the time . the poor and the rich are here brought to the same level  they have equal claims to learn and practise the truth . truth is equally accessible to all . to the religion of islam  no aristocracy is known . before the great master the differences of rank  wealth and colour sink into insignificance  and therefore before allah s messenger  as before allah himself  they must all stand upon one level . everyone is answerable for what he does is the golden prin ciple preached by islam . a  53  the simple and decisive answer given above no doubt wounded the pride of the wealthy quraish  who were required to sit along with the poor slaves whom they never treated as human beings  and thus they were tried . b  59  the clear book is the great law of cause and effect . the falling of the 172 6 . cattle 661 knows what you earn by day  then he raises you up in it that an appointed term may be fulfilled . then to him is your return  then he will inform you of what you did . section 8  divine judgment 61 and he is the supreme above his servants  and he sends keepers over you  until when death comes to one of you  our messengers cause him to die  and they are not remiss . 62 then are they sent back to allah  their master  the true one . now surely his is the judgment and he is swiftest in taking account . 63 say  who is it that delivers you from the calamities of the land and the sea   when  you call upon him  in humility and in secret  if he deliver us from this  we will certainly be of the grateful ones . 64 say  allah delivers you from this and from every distress  yet you set up partners  with him  . 65 say  he has the power to send on you a punishment from above you or from beneath your feet  or to throw you into confusion   making you  of different factions  and make some of you taste the violence of others . see how we repeat the messages that they may under stand   leaf indicates that its power to draw nourishment has come to an end  thus do individuals and nations fall . the grain in the darkness of the earth stands for the mission of the prophet  for that grain was destined to sprout forth  growing into a tree of exceptional proportions . the  green  indicates those people that prosper and the  dry  those that must fall off . a  65  the three forms of punishment were witnessed by the holy prophet s opponents later on . a punishment from above took the form of a storm during the wellknown battle of the allies  when an army between ten and twenty thousand strong took to flight on account of a great storm  a punishment from beneath took the form of a drought which brought great affliction upon the people of makkah for seven years  while they were made to taste the violence at the hands of the muslims in the battles which they themselves started and which brought about the final disruption of the power of the quraish . applied to the modern west  the punishment from above and punishment from below are  respectively  the tyranny of the bourgeois and the tyranny of the proletariate . the capitalists first tyrannized labour and then communism wreaked vengeance on the capitalists . to these two punishments is now added a third . the whole world is divided into parties which aim at each other s destruction and the violence of man against man has reached a 6  66 â€¢ abraham s argument for divine unity 1 73 66 and your people call it a lie and it is the truth . say  i am not put in charge of you . 67 for every prophecy is a term  and you will soon come to know  it  . a 68 and when you see those who talk nonsense about our messages  withdraw from them until they enter into some other discourse . and if the devil cause you to forget  then do not sit after recollection with the unjust people . 69 and those who keep their duty are not accountable for them at all but  theirs  is only to remind  perhaps they may guard against evil . 70 and leave those who take their religion for a play and an idle sport  and whom this world s life has deceived  and remind  people  with this  message  in case a soul be destroyed for what it has earned . it has besides allah no friend nor intercessor  and though it offer every compensation  it will not be accepted from it . those are they who are destroyed for what they earn . for them is a drink of boiling water and a painful punishment  because they disbelieved . section 9  abraham s argument for divine unity 71 say  shall we call  besides allah  on that which does not benefit us nor harm us  and shall we be turned back on our heels after allah has guided us  like one whom the devils cause to follow his low desires  in bewilderment in the earth â€ ” he has companions who call him to the right way  saying   come to us . say  surely the guidance of allah  that is the  true  guidance . and we are commanded to submit to the lord of the worlds  72 and that you should keep up prayer and keep your duty to him . and he it is to whom you shall be gathered . 73 and he it is who created the peak unthought of by the world . whole cities with their millions of residents are turned into graves in the twinkling of an eye  and this wholesale destruction of man by man is considered as the greatest feat of material civilization . a  67  the prophecy of the vanquishment of the powerful opponents of islam is declared with even greater emphasis than in the earlier stage of the pro phet s mission  despite the apparent triumph of opposition to his cause which had succeeded in scattering the few people who accepted islam . 174

to be impossible to people â€ ” is meant . b  732  the reference may be either to the resurrection when human beings will be raised to be brought to judgment  or the great spiritual resurrection which was to be brought about through the holy prophet when the whole of arabia was destined to receive a new life  the life spiritual  or perhaps to the still greater spiri tual resurrection when the whole of humanity was destined to receive a new life through the triumph of islam . c  74  whether azar was the father of abraham  or his grandfather or uncle  is a much disputed point . the word ab means a father as well as an ancestor  and in 2133 it is applied to an uncle because there ishmael is spoken of as an ab of jacob . abraham s father  walid  is indicated in 1441 to be a believer  while the sire  ab  is elsewhere mentioned as having stuck to idolatry till his death  9114  . hence i prefer sire as the significance of the word . d  75  showing abraham the kingdom of the heavens and the earth signifies granting him an insight into the divine laws of nature working in the kingdom of the heavens and the earth . this insight had convinced him that allah was the real controller of the universe  while the sun  the moon  the stars and other heavenly bodies  were only his creation and subject to his laws . e  76  these words  which literally mean this is my lord  do not contain abraham s conviction . the words are either uttered by way of surprise or  as trans lated here  the phrase may be interrogatory  expressing disapproval . it should be borne in mind that abraham never worshipped idols or the heavenly bodies like his people . he has already been spoken of in v. 74 as denouncing the idolworship of his people  and in v. 75 as possessing certainty of faith in one god . further on  we find it clearly stated in v. 83 that what is related here was an argument by which abraham tried to convince his people that they worshipped false deities  which were themselves subject to divine laws . 678  abraham s argument for divine unity 1 75 he said  if my lord had not guided me  i should certainly be of the people who are in error . 78 then when he saw the sun rising  he said  is this my lord  is this the greatest  so when it set  he said  my people  i am clear of what you set up  with allah  . 79 surely i have turned myself  being upright  wholly to him who originated the heavens and the earth  and i am not of those who set up partners  with allah  . 80 and his people disputed with him . he said  do you dispute with me respecting allah and he has guided me indeed  and i do not fear in any way those that you set up with him  unless my lord please . my lord comprehends all things in his knowledge . will you not then be mindful  81 and how should i fear what you have set up  with him   while you do not fear to set up partners with allah for which he has sent down to you no authority  which then of the two parties is surer of security  if you know  82 those who believe and do not mix up their faith with wrong doing â€ ” for them is security and they go aright . section 10  prophets among abraham s descendants 83 and this was our argument which we gave to abraham against his people . we exalt in degrees whom we please . surely your lord is wise  knowing . 84 and we gave him isaac and jacob . each did we guide  and noah did we guide before  and of his descendants  david and solomon and job and joseph and moses and aaron . and thus do we reward those who do good  to others   85 and zacharias and john and jesus and elias  each one  of them  was of the righteous  86 and ishmael and elisha and jonah and lot  and each one  of them  we made to excel the people  87 and some of their fathers and their descendants and their brethren . and we chose them and guided them to the right way . 88 this is allah s guidance with which he guides whom he pleases of his servants . and if they had set up partners  with him   all that they did would have been fruitless . 89 these are they to 176 6 . cattle 690 whom we gave the book and authority and prophecy.  therefore if these disbelieve in it  we have indeed entrusted it to a people who are not disbelievers in it . 90 these are they whom allah guided  so follow their guidance . say  i do not ask you for any reward for it . it is nothing but a reminder for the nations . section 1 1  truth of divine revelation 91 and they do not honour allah with the honour due to him  when they say  allah has not revealed anything to a mortal . c say  who revealed the book which moses brought  a light and a gui dance to people â€ ” you make it into  scattered  papers  which you a  89  each one of the prophets was given three things . the first was the kitdb  the book  or the divine revelation which the prophet was granted to guide people aright . the second is called hukm  which means authority to judge . this shows that every prophet received authority directly from god  and it was by divine authority that he judged his people . the third is nubuwwat  which means prophethood or the gift of prophecy . the book contains directions for guidance of the people and nubuwwat is the prophetical part which is meant to strengthen faith . thus the holy prophet muhammad was granted the gift of prophecy long before he was granted the book which began with the words  read in the name of your lord  96  1  . further there is a vast number of his prophecies which are contained in the hadith and which do not form a part of the book  the quran . b  90  the prophet is told to follow the guidance of all the earlier prophets because his message was for all the nations to whom previous prophets had sepa rately come . hence the quran is called a reminder  showing that it was meant for all the nations  to whom it was a reminder of what they had received before . the prophet is  in fact  here told that he was now the representative of all the prophets that had gone before him  and therefore possessed all the excellences which were granted to those prophets separately . c  911  the words allah has not revealed anything to a mortal may mean a total denial of god revealing himself to man or simply a denial of revelation to the holy prophet . the jews and the christians are told in this verse that the same god who revealed a book to moses  containing a clear prophecy of a prophet like him  has now in fulfilment of that prophecy sent the like of moses . their only answer to that clear prophecy was that they would not mention it or talk of it at all â€ ” and you conceal much . the deniers of divine revelation are also told  more generally  that the proof of revelation was in the knowledge which it gave â€ ” you are taught what neither you nor your fathers knew . rf  912  the book was not kept intact  hence its description as scattered papers . 6  92 â€¢ ultimate triumph of the truth 1 77 show and you conceal much  and you are taught what neither you nor your fathers knew . say  allah . then leave them sporting in their idle talk . 92 and this is a blessed book we have revealed  verifying what is  already  before it  and that you may warn the mothertown  and those around it . and those who believe in the hereafter believe in it  and they keep a guard over their prayers . 93 and who is more unjust than he who forges a lie against allah  or says  revelation has been granted to me  while nothing has been revealed to him  and he who says  i can reveal the like of what allah has revealed   and if you could see when the wrong doers are in the agonies of death and the angels stretch forth their hands   saying   yield up your souls . this day you are awarded a punishment of disgrace because you spoke against allah other than truth  and  because  you scorned his messages . 94 and cer tainly you have come to us one by one as we created you at first  and you have left behind your backs what we gave you . and we do not see with you your intercessors about whom you asserted that they were  allah s  partners in respect to you . certainly the ties between you are now cut off and what you asserted has failed you . section 12  ultimate triumph of the truth 95 surely allah causes the grain and the datestone to germi nate . he brings forth the living from the dead and he is the bringer forth of the dead from the living . that is allah . how are you then turned away  from truth   e 96 he is the cleaver of the daybreak  a  92  umm alqura or the mother of the towns is the title by which makkah is known . the reason is not only that it was both the political and the spiritual centre of arabia  but also because it was destined to be the universal spiritual centre â€ ” the real mother of the whole world . b  93  these words declare the holy prophet free of having forged a lie against allah . the claim  i can reveal the like of what allah has revealed  are the words of those who refuse to believe in the truth of divine revelation . c  95  the preaching of the holy prophet is likened to the sowing of the seed which  though to all appearance it is lost in the earth  soon springs forth into a large tree . the bringing forth the living from the dead is the bringing forth a living 178 6 . cattle â€¢691 and he has made the night for rest  and the sun and the moon for reckoning . that is the measuring of the mighty  the knowing .  97 and he it is who has made the stars for you that you might follow the right way by them in the darkness of the land and the sea . indeed we have made plain the signs for a people who know . 98 and he it is who has brought you into being from a single soul  then there is  for you  an abode and a repository indeed we have made plain the signs for a people who under stand . 99 and he it is who sends down water from the clouds  then we bring forth with it buds of all  plants   then we bring forth from it green  foliage   from which we produce clustered grain  and of the datepalm  of the sheaths of it  come forth clusters  of dates  within reach  and gardens of grapes and the olive and the pomegranate  alike and unlike . look at the fruit of it when it bears fruit and the ripening of it . surely there are signs in this for a people who believe  iâ°â°and they regard the jinn to be partners with allah  and he created them  and they falsely attribute to him sons and daughters without knowledge . glory be to him  and supreme ly exalted is he above what they ascribe  to him   people from the spiritually dead arabs  and the bringing forth the dead from the living alludes to the spiritual death of those who had been previously granted spiri tual life through divine revelation . a  96  the darkness prevailing in the earth would soon be dispelled  and would give place to light  even as  with the break of the morning  darkness gives place to light . b  97  the holy prophet is likened to the sun  and those who receive light from him and transmit it to others are likened to the stars . the analogy is that he who makes light to guide you physically could not have neglected your spiritual guidance . c  98  the abode may indicate this life and the repository the grave . d  100  the reference is either to the dualistic doctrine of the magi  who thought that while allah was the creator of good  the devil was the creator of evil  or to the arab belief that the jinn had a hand in the transaction of their affairs  or in bringing them good fortune or ill luck . 6101  gradual progress 179 section 13  gradual progress 101 wonderful originator of the heavens and the earth  how could he have a son when he has no consort  and he created everything  and he is the knower of all things .  102 that is allah  your lord . there is no god but he  the creator of all things  there fore serve him  and he has charge of all things . 103 vision can not comprehend him  and he comprehends  all  vision  and he is the knower of subtleties  the aware . 104 clear proofs have indeed come to you from your lord  so whoever sees  it is for the good of his own soul  and whoever is blind  it is to its harm . and i am not a keeper over you . 105 and thus do we repeat the messages  and that they may say  7ou have studied  and that we may make it clear to a people who know . 106 follow what is revealed to you from jour lord â€ ” there is no god but he  and turn away from those who set up partners  with allah  . 107 and if allah had pleased  they would not have set up others  with him  . and we have not appointed you a keeper over them  and you are not in charge of them . 108 and do not abuse those whom they call upon besides allah  in case  exceeding the limits  they abuse allah through ignorance . c thus to every people have we made their deeds seem good  then to their lord is their return so he will inform them of what they did . 109 and they swear their strongest oaths by allah that if a sign comes to them they would certainly believe in it . say  signs are with allah . and what should make you know that when they come they do not believe  110 and we turn their hearts a  101  this verse and those that follow describe the transcendental unity of the divine being . to attribute a son to him is to acknowledge that he had a con sort  otherwise the word son will have to be taken simply as a metaphor . b  103  the physical vision of man  working as it does only within narrow limits and being able only to see bodies  can not comprehend the infinite one . he is the allpervading spirit  and can be seen only with the spiritual eye . c  108  here muslims are forbidden to abuse even the idols of other people  though their worship is condemned in the strongest terms . rf  109  many signs of the holy prophet s truth had appeared while he was 180 6 . cattle 6111 and their sights  just as they did not believe in it the first time  and we leave them in their inordinacy  blindly wandering on .  section 14  idolaters  opposition 111 and even if we send down to them the angels and the dead speak to them and we bring together all things before them  they would not believe unless allah please  but most of them are ignorant . 112 and thus did we make for every prophet an enemy  the devils from among the people and the jinn  some of them inspiring others with gilded speech to deceive  them   and if your lord pleased  they would not do it  so leave them alone with what they forge â€ ” 113 and that the hearts of those who do not believe in the hereafter may incline to it  and that they may be pleased with it  and that they may earn what they are earning . 114 shall i then seek a judge other than allah  when he it is who has sent down to you the book fully explained . and those still at makkah  but they still went on demanding signs . the reply   signs are with allah   means that the sign which they demanded would be shown and that allah had the power to show all kinds of signs . but even then they would not believe . the first sign of the overthrow of the power of the quraish appeared in the battle of badr  but they did not believe even then . a  110  the turning of their hearts and sights is allah s leaving them in their inordinacy  as explained by the verse itself . and even this is due to their own action in rejecting the truth . when an attitude of enmity is assumed towards the truth  the heart becomes estranged from it  and this growing estrangement is term ed the turning away of the heart from it . b  111  there are always some people who turn a deaf ear to every argu ment  and it is of such leaders of evil that this verse speaks  see next verse . the coming of the angels stands for the execution of the decree of their punishment . the speaking of the dead refers either to the raising of the spiritually dead to life  see v. 122   or to the evidence of those who had passed away before the prophet  being given through their writings . and lastly  by the bringing together of all things is meant the bringing together of things relating to their punishment . the meaning is that some of the opponents are so blind that the clearest of signs or proofs would not convince them . c  112  by the people and the jinn here are apparently meant the ordinary people and the leaders  suggesting to each other varnished tales of falsehood . see later v. 128 footnote 1 for a fuller discussion of the word mo . 6115  idolaters  opposition 181 whom we have given the book know that it is revealed by your lord with truth  so do not be one of the disputers . 115 and the word of jour lord has been accomplished truly and justly . there is none who can change his words  and he is the hearer  the knower .  116 and if you obey most of those in the earth  they will lead you astray from allah s way . they follow nothing but con jecture  and they only lie . 117 surely jour lord â€ ” he knows best who goes astray from his way  and he knows best the guided ones . 118 eat  then  of that on which allah s name has been men tioned  if you are believers in his messages . 119 and what reason have you that you should not eat of that on which allah s name is mentioned  when he has already made plain to you what he has forbidden to you â€ ” except what you are compelled to . c and surely many lead  people  astray by their low desires through ignorance . surely jour lord â€ ” he best knows the transgressors . 120 and avoid open sins and secret ones . surely they who earn sin will be rewarded for what they have earned . 121 and do not eat of that on which allah s name has not been mentioned  and that is surely a transgression . 2 and certainly the devils inspire their friends a  115  the word signifies the prophetic word  see 634 footnote . b  118  the establishment of the doctrine of divine unity  which is the object of this chapter  required the abolition of all idolatrous practices  among which was the practice of slaughtering animals in the names of idols . it is allowed to mus lims to slaughter animals for food  but allah s name must be mentioned when the animal is slaughtered . this is also a reminder to man that this act of the taking of a life  even though it is the life of an animal  is made lawful only by divine per mission  for the attainment of a necessary purpose . c  119  the reference in these words is to what is said in an earlier revela tion  see 16115 . the same subject is again referred to in 6145  as also in 2173 and in greater detail in 53  both of these being revelations at madinah . d  120  the muslim is here commanded to consider open and secret sins to be equally hateful . in fact there are very few people who commit open sins as compared with those who are guilty of secret sins . e  121  these words are explained by the majority as containing only a pro hibition against the eating of that which is slaughtered in the name of others than allah . 182 6 . cattle 6122 to contend with you  and if you obey them  you will surely be those who set up partners  with allah  . section 15  the chief opponents 122 is he who was dead  then we raised him to life and made for him a light by which he walks among the people  like him whose likeness is that of one in darkness from which he can not come forth  a thus their doings are made to seem good to the dis believers . 123 and thus have we made in every town the leaders of its guilty ones  that they may make plans in it . and they plan only against themselves  and they do not perceive . 124 and when a message comes to them they say  we will not believe till we are given the like of what allah s messengers are given . allah best knows where to place his message . humiliation from allah and severe punish ment will surely befall the guilty for their planning . 125 so whomsoever allah intends to guide  he expands his breast for islam  and whomsoever he intends to leave in error  he makes his breast close  and  narrow as though he were ascending upwards . thus does allah lay uncleanness on those who do not believe . 126 and this is the path of jour lord   a  straight  path  . indeed we have made the messages clear for a people who are mindful . 127 theirs is the abode of peace with their lord  and he is their friend because of what they do . 128 and on the day when he will gather them all together  o assembly of jinn  e you took away a great part of the people . and a  122  these words explain what is meant by the raising of the dead to life through the prophets . through the quran the dead were raised to life and given a light by which they showed the way to others . the concluding words of the verse show that  despite witnessing this great transformation  the leaders of mischief went on opposing the truth as if it were a good deed . b  125  the concluding words of the verse show that uncleanness of the heart  which makes a person s breast close and narrow  as though he were ascen ding upwards  is the result of a man s own disbelief and rejection of the truth . c  1281  the word jinn is derived from janna  meaning he covered or concealed or hid ox protected . the class of beings that goes under this name stands in the quran for the spirits of evil or the beings that invite man to evil  as opposed 6  129 â€¢ evils of idolatry 183 their friends from among the people will say  our lord  some of us profited by others and we have reached our appointed term which you appointed for us . he will say  the fire is your abode â€ ” you shall abide in it  except as allah please .  surely your lord is wise  knowing . 129 and thus do we make some of the wrong doers to befriend others on account of what they earn . section 16  evils of idolatry 130 o community of jinn and people  did not messengers come to you from among you  relating to you my messages and warning you of the meeting of this day of yours  they will say  we bear witness against ourselves . and this world s life deceived them  and they will bear witness against themselves that they were disbelievers . 131 this is because your lord would not destroy towns unjustly while their people are negligent . c 132 and for all are degrees according to their doings . and your lord is not heedless of what they do . 133 and your lord is the selfsufficient one  the lord of mercy . if he please  he may remove you  and make whom to the angels  who invite him to good  both being alike invisible to the human eye . but there is a wider use of the word in arabic literature as well as in the quran . one signification of the word is explained under 721 . but the word is also applied in the quran to powerful leaders who  through their importance and detachment from the masses  do not mix freely with them  so they remain distant or  hidden from their eyes  . verses 129131 show that by the jinn here are meant the human leaders of evil . a  1282  the words except as allah please indicate that those in hell shall after all be delivered from it . b  130  by calling the jinn and people a single community  the quran has made it clear that the jinn and the people spoken of here are not two different classes of beings . again  the jinn and the people are told that messengers had come to them from among them  i.e . from among jinn and people . but as the only messengers spoken of in the quran and other reliable histories of prophets are those who belong to mankind  it follows that the jinn spoken of here belong to mankind  and not to any other class of creation . c  131  that is  while the reminder and the warning had not yet come to them . or  the words mean that it is not for negligence that nations are destroyed  it is only when they become wrongdoers and spread mischief in the world that they are overtaken by punishment in this life . 184 6 . cattle 6134 he pleases successors after you  just as he raised you up from the offspring of other people . 134 surely what you are promised will come to pass  and you can not escape  it  . i 3s say  my people  act according to your ability  i too am acting  so you will soon come to know for whom is the  good  end of the abode . surely the wrongdoers will not succeed . 136 and they set apart a portion for allah out of what he has created of crops and cattle  and say  this is for allah â€ ” so they assert â€ ” and this for our associategods . then that which is for their associategods does not reach allah  and that which is for allah reaches their associategods . evil is what they judge.  137 and thus their associategods have made it seem good to many idolaters the killing of their children  that they may cause them to perish and obscure for them their religion . and if allah had pleased  they would not have done it  so leave them alone with what they forge . 138 and they say  such and such cattle and crops are prohi bited â€ ” none shall eat them except such as we please â€ ” so they assert â€ ” and cattle whose backs are forbidden  and cattle on which they would not mention allah s name c â€ ” forging a lie against him . he will recompense them for what they forge . i 39 and they say  what is in the wombs of such and such cattle is reserved for our males  and forbidden to our wives  and if it be a  136  it was a custom among the arab idolaters to set apart certain portions of the produce of their fields and their cattle  one portion for allah and another portion for the idols . the portion for idols was always applied to their use  but the portion set apart for allah  though ordinarily spent to feed the poor and the needy  was in certain cases diverted to the use of the idols . the portion for the idols was handed over to the priests . b  137  this refers to the practice of killing or burying alive the female children  and also to the human sacrifices to idols  as they sometimes vowed that  if they had a number of sons  they would sacrifice one of them to an idol . by introducing these superstitious and evil customs they were making confused and obscure the true religion â€ ” the religion of the service of one god . c  138  that is  such as were sacrificed in the name of idols . all these along with what is said in the next two verses are denounced as being idolatrous prac tices . 6  140 â€¢ idolaters  selfimposed prohibitions 185 stillborn  they are partners in it . he will reward them for their  false  attribution . surely he is wise  knowing . 140 they are losers indeed who kill their children foolishly without knowledge  and forbid what allah has provided for them  forging a lie against allah . they indeed go astray  and are not guided . section 17  idolaters  selfimposed prohibitions 141 and he it is who produces gardens  trellised and untrellised  and palms and seedproduce of which the fruits are of various sorts  and olives and pomegranates like and unlike . eat of its fruit when it bears fruit  and pay the due of it on the day of its reaping  and do not be extravagant . surely he does not love the extravagant  142 and of the cattle  he has created  some for burden and some for slaughter . eat of what allah has given you and do not follow the footsteps of the devil . surely he is your open enemy â€ ” 143 eight in pairs â€ ” of the sheep two and of the goats two . say  has he forbidden the two males or the two females or what the wombs of the two females contain  inform me with knowledge  if you are truthful   144 and of the camels two and of the cows two . say  has he forbidden the two males or the two females or what the wombs of the two females contain  or were you witnesses when allah enjoined you this  who is then more unjust than he who forges a lie against allah to lead people astray without know ledge  surely allah does not guide the wrongdoing people . section 18  prohibited foods 145 say  i do not find in what is revealed to me anything forbidden for an eater to eat of  except if it is what dies of itself  or blood poured forth  or flesh of swine â€ ” for that surely is unclean â€ ” or what is a transgression  other than the name of allah having been invoked on it . but whoever is driven by necessity  not desiring a  143  the arabs considered those animals which were otherwise lawful for them to be unlawful in particular cases . these practices  which were all super stitious  resulting from idolworship  are here condemned . b  145  the reason for the prohibition of what dies of itself and blood and 186 6 . cattle 6146 nor exceeding the limit  then surely jour lord is forgiving  merciful . 146 and to those who are jews we forbade every animal having claws  and we forbade them the fat of oxen and sheep  except such as was on their backs or the entrails or what was mixed with bones . this was a punishment we gave them on account of their rebellion  and we are surely truthful . 147 but if they reject you  then say  your lord is the lord of allencompass ing mercy  and his punishment can not be averted from the guilty people . 148 those who set up partners  with allah  say  if allah pleased we would not have set up partners  with him  nor our fathers  nor would we have made anything unlawful . thus did those before them reject  the truth  until they tasted our punish ment . say  have you any knowledge so you would bring it forth to us  you only follow a conjecture and you only tell lies . 149 say  then allah s is the conclusive argument  so if he had pleased  he would have guided you all . i 50 say  bring your witnesses who bear witness that allah forbade this . if they bear witness  then do not bear witness with them . and do not follow the low desires of swine s flesh is that these things are physically unclean  while the reason for the prohibition of animals on which other than allah s name is invoked is that all things are to be avoided which are in any way associated with idolatry . a  147  the allencompassing mercy of allah is mentioned even in speaking of those who rejected the holy prophet . it was because of the mercy of allah that the disbelievers were not destroyed immediately  but as punishing the  guilty  is in itself a mercy towards the weak and the oppressed  they are warned that they will not escape punishment if they persist in their evil ways . b  149  the previous verse records the statement of the disbelievers   if allah pleased we would not have set up partners with him  . the reply is that allah reveals his will through his chosen messengers  so bring forth any divine revelation that you possess sanctioning idolatry . the argument is here carried on further . allah does not mislead people  but  in fact  he sends his prophets to guide them into the right path . his pleasure is therefore that everyone should walk in the right path and serve only one master . that is the conclusive argument against the false assertion of the idolaters . the guidance of allah is  moreover  brought through prophets  and people are never compelled to accept the right way  much less could they be compelled to follow the wrong course . man was created with a will free within certain limits to act as he pleases . 6151  guiding rules of life 1 87 those who reject our messages and those who do not believe in the hereafter  and they make  others  equal with their lord . section 19  guiding rules of life 151 say  come  i will recite what your lord has forbidden to you  set up no partner with him  and do good to parents  nor kill your children for  fear of  poverty â€ ” we provide for you and for them  nor go near to indecencies  open or secret  nor kill the soul which allah has made sacred except in the course of justice . this he enjoins upon you that you may understand . 152 and do not app roach the property of the orphan except in the best manner   until he attains his maturity . and give full measure and weight with equity â€ ” we do not impose on any soul a duty beyond its ability . and when you speak  be just  even  against  a relative . and fulfil allah s covenant . this he enjoins on you that you may be mind ful  153 and  know  that this is my path  the right one  so follow it  and do not follow  other  ways  for they will lead you away from his way . this he enjoins on you that you may keep your duty . 154 again  we gave the book to moses to complete  our blessings  on him who would do good  and making plain all things c and a guidance and a mercy  so that they might believe in the meeting with their lord . section 20  the goal for the faithful 155 and this is a book we have revealed  full of blessings  so follow it and keep your duty that mercy may be shown to you  156 in case you say that the book was revealed only to two parties a  1521  that is  unless you do it with the object of improving it or making it profitable . wages of the guardian may be paid from it  for which see 46. b  1522  islam requires a person to be so upright as not to be led away by the ties of relationship . truth is not to be sacrificed to any interest but every interest must be sacrificed to truth . c  154  by all things are meant all those things needed for the guidance of the israelites . 188 6 . cattle â€¢ 6  157 before us and we were truly unaware of what they read   157 or  you say  if the book had been revealed to us  we would have been better guided than they . so indeed clear proof has come to you from your lord  and guidance and mercy . who is then more unjust than he who rejects allah s messages and turns away from them  we reward those who turn away from our messages with an evil punishment because they turned away . 158 they only wait that the angels should come to them  or that your lord should come   or that some of the signs of your lord should come . on the day when some of the signs of your lord come  its faith will not benefit a soul which did not believe before  nor earned good through its faith. say  wait  we too are waiting . 159 as for those who split up their religion and became sects  you have no concern with them . their affair is only with allah  then he will inform them of what they did . 160 whoever brings a good deed will have tenfold like it  and whoever brings an evil deed  will be recompensed only with the like of it  and they shall not be wronged . a  156  as in arabia there lived only the jews and the christians besides the idolaters  the arabs spoke of only two parties to whom the book was given . b  1581  for a similar expression see 2210 . also v. ill and note . similar words occur also in 1633   they only wait that the angels should come to them or that your lord s command should come to pass  . here the words are that your lord should come . thus the coming of the lord carries the same significance as the coming to pass of his command  or the execution of his decree  i.e . the final doom of the opponents . the coming of the angels stands for the smaller visita tions or distresses the opponents witnessed in the battles which they fought to annihilate islam  in which the coming of angels is spoken of  see 3125126  89. c  1582  the only time when faith does not benefit a soul is the approach of death  and hence i am of opinion that by  some of the signs of your lord  are meant clear signs of approach of death . a person s death is in one sense also his resurrection   whoever dies  his resurrection comes to pass   mishkat  266  . d  160  no other sacred book gives such prominence to the quality of mercy in the divine being . while evil must have its evil consequence  it is only its like  but virtue brings a tenfold reward . according to a saying of the holy prophet  evil is pardoned or recompensed with its like  while good brings from a tenfold to a sevenhundredfold reward  bukhari  8133  . thus the verse mentions only the maximum punishment of evil and the minimum reward of good . 6161  the goal for the faithful 1 89 161 say  as for me  my lord has guided me to the right path â€ ” a right religion  the faith of abraham  the upright one  and he was not of those who set up partners  with allah  . 162 say  my prayer and my sacrifice and my life and my death are surely for allah  the lord of the worlds â€ ” 163 no partner has he . and this am i commanded  and i am the first of those who submit .  164 say  shall i seek a lord other than allah  while he is the lord of all things  and no soul earns  evil  but against itself . nor does a bearer of burden bear another s burden . then to your lord is your return  so he will inform you of that in which you differed . i 65 and he it is who has made you successors in the land and exalted some of you in rank above others  that he may try you by what he has given you . surely your lord is quick in retribution  and he is surely the forgiving  the merciful . e a  163  the idea of entire submission to the divine being conveyed in the word islam finds its perfect manifestation in the holy prophet  who is the first of the muslims . above even the noblest object that a person can set for himself stands the love of the divine being . it is the highest goal of human life  and every muslim is taught to set that goal before himself . b  164  in these words the christian doctrine of atonement is rejected by the quran . elsewhere we have   that no bearer of burden bears another s burden  and that man can have nothing but what he strives for   533839  . every person who is born is called a bearer of burden  not because he is a sinner  but because he starts life with certain responsibilities of his own . c  165  with the highest goal of life before them  muslims are now told that they were going to be made rulers in the land . their exaltation above others  how ever  was not due to their wealth or to their political power but simply to the fact that they submitted themselves to god  that their prayers and their sacrifices were not for their nation or their country but for god  who was the rabb  the nourisher to perfection  of the whole of humanity . hence they were a people who had the betterment of the whole of humanity in view . but even they are told  in the con cluding words of the verse  that if they fall off and follow evil ways they will be requited  though the forgiveness and mercy of the divine being will ultimately take them by the hand . chapter 7 aiaraf the elevated places the title of this chapter is taken from the mention of the elevated places  v. 46  on which stand the perfect righteous servants of allah . the main theme of this chapter is the truth of divine revelation . it illustrates this by referring to the histories of several prophets  warning that the opponents of the holy prophet would meet the same fate as the opponents of the earlier prophets if they did not mend their ways . the chapter goes on to relate the history of moses  as the prophet muhammad appeared in the likeness of moses accord ing to prophecies in the torah . towards the end  it gives the essence of the last and present chapter . this chapter was revealed at makkah  just prior to the emigration of the holy prophet . section 1  opponents  doom in the name of allah  the beneficent  the merciful . 1 i  allah  am the best knower  the truthful . a 2 a book revealed to you â€ ” so let there be no worry in your heart con cerning it â€ ” that you may warn with it  and a reminder to the believers . c 3 follow what has been revealed to you from your lord and do not follow besides him any guardians  little mindful are you  4 and how many a town have we destroyed  so our punish ment came to it by night or while they slept at midday . 5 yet their a  1  of the four letters alif  lam  mim  and sad  the first three are the same as at the commencement of ch . 2  for which see 21 footnote  while sad stands for sadiq  meaning truthful  whose promise would not fail . b  21  this parenthetical passage is introduced to console the holy prophet  who at this time was encountering the greatest opposition and was surrounded by difficulties on all sides . c  22  the quran is called a reminder because  being in consonance with human nature  it is a reminder of what is imprinted on human nature . it may  how ever  have the alternative meaning of honour or eminence  for which see 2  1 52 . 190 7  6 â€¢ opponents  doom 191 cry  when our punishment came to them  was nothing but that they said  surely we were wrongdoers . 6 then certainly we shall question those to whom messengers were sent  and we shall ques tion the messengers  7 then surely we shall recount to them with knowledge  and we are never absent . 8 and the judging on that day will be just  so as for those whose good deeds are heavy  they are the successful . 9 and as for those whose good deeds are light  those are they who ruined their souls because they disbelieved in our messages . 10 and certainly we established you in the earth and made in it means of livelihood for you  little thanks you give  section 2  the devil s opposition to man 11 and we indeed created you  then we fashioned you  then we said to the angels  be submissive to adam . so they sub mitted  but not iblts  he was not of those who submitted . 12 he said  what hindered you from submitting when i commanded you  he said  i am better than he  you have created me of fire  while him you did create of dust . c 13 he said  then get forth from this  state   for it is not for you to behave proudly in it . go forth  a  6  those to whom messengers were sent will be questioned as to how they treated the messengers  and the latter as to how they were received . b  11  that what is stated here of adam is true of all mankind is made clear by the opening words of this verse . human beings are created first  then fashion ed  then the order is given to the angels to make submission to adam  who in this sense typifies a human being . thus the angels are really required to make sub mission to every human being . c  12  not only is adam created from dust  but all human beings are spoken of as being similarly created  see 359 footnote  and see also 1837  225 and 3020 . as a contrast to man s creation from dust  the devil claims to have been created from fire . there may be a reference here to the nature of the temperaments of the two classes  human beings and devils . the quran says elsewhere   man is created of haste   2137   which means that he is hasty . in like manner the devil s creation of fire may mean that he is made of a fiery temperament  while the perfect man is humble and meek  being created of dust  which stands for humility and meekness . elsewhere it is stated that the jinn were created of fire  1527   and also that iblls was one of the jinn  1850  . 192 7 . the elevated places â€¢ 7  14 therefore  surely you are a degraded one . 14 he said  grant me respite till the day when they are raised .  15 he said  surely jou are granted respite . 16 he said  as you have judged me to be in error  i will certainly lie in wait for them in your straight path  17 then i shall certainly come upon them from in front of them and from behind them  and from their right and from their left  and you will not find most of them thankful . 18 he said  get out of it  despised  driven away . whoever of them will follow you  i will certainly fill hell with you all . 19 and  we said   o adam  dwell you and jour wife in the garden  and eat from wherever you wish  but do not go near this tree or you would be from among the unjust . 20 but the devil made an evil suggestion to them that he might make manifest to them their shame that had been hidden from them   and he said  your lord has only forbidden you this tree that you may not become angels or become immortals . 21 and he swore to them both  surely i am a sincere adviser to you â€ ” 22 thus he caused them to fall by deceit . so when they had tasted of the tree  their shame became manifest to them  and they both began to cover themselves with the leaves of the garden . c and their lord called to them  did i not forbid you that tree  and say to you that the devil is surely your open enemy  23 they said  our lord  we have wronged ourselves  a  14  the devil s grip continues only so long as man is not spiritually raised to life . the raising here stands for the spiritual resurrection of man . if the final resurrection is meant  the significance would be that the devil would mislead man so long as man lives on this earth . b  20  the devil s suggestions always lead man to the disclosure of his shame . c  22  the covering with the leaves of the garden is the desire to make up by human effort any fault that may have been committed . the clothing that guards against evil  which is spoken of in v. 26 as being the best clothing  explains the meaning of covering here . divine revelation points out to man the true way  enabling him to cover himself or guard himself against evil . and  further  the state ment in v. 27  pulling off from them both their clothing that he might show them their shame shows that covering with the leaves of the garden is an allegorical statement  see v. 27 footnote 1 . 7  24 â€¢ warning against the devil s insinuations 1 93 and if you do not forgive us and have mercy on us  we shall certainly be from among the losers . 24 he said  go forth â€ ” some of you are enemies of others . and there is for you in the earth an abode and a provision for a time . 25 he said  in it shall you live  and in it shall you die  and from it shall you be raised . section 3  warning against the devil s insinuations 26 o children of adam  we have indeed sent down to you clothing to cover your shame and  clothing  for beauty  and clothing that guards against evil â€ ” that is the best .  this is of the messages of allah that they may be mindful . 27 children of adam  do not let the devil seduce you  as he expelled your parents from the garden  pulling off from them both their clothing that he might show them their shame . he surely sees you  he as well as his company  from where you do not see them . surely we have made the devils to be the friends of those who do not believe 28 and when they commit an indecency they say  we found our fathers doing this  and allah has commanded us to do it . say  surely allah does not command indecency . do you say of allah what you do not know  29 say  my lord commands  the doing of  justice . and set upright your faces at every time of prayer and call on him  being sincere to him in obedience . as he brought you a  26  clothing at first simply served to cover shame  with further progress people sought to embellish their persons with it  but there is yet a third kind of clothing  says the quran  which is the best  and that is the clothing of piety  literally the clothing that guards one against evil . it indicates a further step in the progress of man  for virtue is an embellishment of the mind  and when man has seen the good of embellishing his person  he will soon be aware of the necessity of embellishing his mind . b  271  that the clothing for the body is not meant here is clear from the fact that all men and women are warned against a similar attack of the devil . as to the clothing of which adam was divested  there remains no doubt  when it is seen that the devil tries to divest every child of adam of the same clothing  it is the clothing that guards against evil . c  272  it is because they do not believe in the truth that the devils are made their friends . those who sever their connection with the source of purity must fall into impurity . 194 7 . the elevated places â€¢ 7  30 into being  so shall you return . 30 some has he guided  and others â€ ” error is justly their due .  surely they took the devils for friends instead of allah  and they think that they are rightly guided . 31 children of adam  attend to your adornment at every time of prayer  and eat and drink and do not be extravagant  surely he does not love the extravagant . section 4  messengers sent for uplift of humanity 32 say  who has forbidden the adornment of allah  c which he has brought forth for his servants  and the good provisions  say  these are for the believers in the life of this world  purely  theirs  on the day of resurrection . thus do we make the mess ages clear for a people who know . 33 say  my lord forbids only indecencies  such of them as are apparent and such as are con cealed  and sin and unjust rebellion  and that you set up with allah partners for which he has sent down no authority  and that you say of allah what you do not know . 34 and every nation has a term  so when its term comes they can not postpone it an hour  nor can they bring it forward . 35 children of adam  if messengers come to you from among you relating to you my messages  then whoever guards against evil and acts aright â€ ” they shall have no fear  nor shall they grieve . a  30  error is justly their due because they have taken the devils for their friends . whoever continues to follow the devil must surely remain in error . b  31  attending to one s adornment carries a double significance here . it requires adorning oneself physically  i.e . being clean and clothed appropriately for prayer  especially for the friday and id gatherings . but what is specially aimed at is adornment in a spiritual sense . a muslim must attend to inner beautification  for prayer is really meant as an aid to the beauty of the soul . he must come to prayer with a heart free from all impurities and full of the highest aspirations and noblest sentiments . c  321  by the adornment of allah is meant the adornment which allah has made lawful for people to avail themselves of . d  322  in the life of this world the believer and the disbeliever equally benefit by the good things  but in the life after death all good shall be exclusively for those who have accepted and acted on the right principles . 736  messengers sent for uplift of humanity 1 95 36 and those who reject our messages and turn away from them haughtily â€ ” these are the companions of the fire  they shall abide in it . 37 who is then more unjust than he who forges a lie against allah or rejects his messages  these â€ ” their portion of the book shall reach them  a until when our messengers come to them caus ing them to die  they say  where are those you used to call upon besides allah  they would say  they are gone away from us . and they shall bear witness against themselves that they were disbelie vers . 38 he will say  enter into the fire among the nations of jinn and people that have passed away before you . every time a nation enters  it curses its sister  until when they all follow one another into it  the last of them will say with regard to the first of them  c our lord  these led us astray  so give them a double punishment of the fire . he will say  each one has double but you do not know . 39 and the first of them will say to the last of them  you have no preference over us  so taste the punishment for what you earned . section 5  those who accept the message 40 those who reject our messages and turn away from them haughtily  the doors of heaven will not be opened for them  nor will they enter the garden until the camel pass through the eye of the needle . and thus do we reward the guilty . 41 they shall have a a  37  that is  the punishment promised in the book will overtake them . b  381  by the sister nation is meant the nation which resembles it in its deeds . c  382  by the last and has first are meant here the common people and the leaders  because  though the words would bear both interpretations  i.e . the last and the first in time or the last and the first in position  the latter significance is corroborated by similar expressions in several other places  such as 2166  1421  3431334047  etc . d  383  the common people would desire that the leaders should suffer a double torment  for their own sins as well as for having misled others . they are told that if the leaders were guilty of misleading them  they themselves deserved a double punishment for having blindly followed the leaders . 196 7 . the elevated places â€¢ 7  42 bed of hell and over them coverings  of it  . and thus do we recompense the wrongdoers . 42 and as for those who believe and do good â€ ” we do not impose on any soul a duty beyond its scope â€ ” they are the owners of the garden  in it they abide . 43 and we shall remove whatever of bitterness is in their hearts â€ ” rivers flow beneath them . and they say  all praise is due to allah  who guided us to this  and we would not have found the way if allah had not guided us . certainly the messengers of our lord brought the truth . and it will be cried out to them  this is the garden which you are made to inherit for what you did . 44 and the owners of the garden call out to the companions of the fire  we have found what our lord promised us to be true  have you  too  found what your lord promised to be true  they will say  yes . then a crier will cry out among them  the curse of allah is on the wrongdoers  45 who hinder  people  from allah s way and seek to make it crooked   and they are disbelievers in the here after . 46 and between them is a veil . and on the elevated places are men who know all by their marks .  and they call out to the owners of the garden  peace be on you  they have not yet entered it  though they hope .  47 and when their eyes are turned towards the companions of the fire  they say  our lord  do not place us with the unjust people a  45  by seeking to make allah s way crooked is meant that they suggest doubts regarding the truth . b  461  the veil which here separates the wicked from the righteous and on account of which the former fail to see the bliss which the latter enjoy will assume a perceptible form in the next life . thus it is not distance that separates heaven from hell but only a veil  and they hear and even see one another . c  462  the men spoken of here as being on the elevated places  the title of this chapter  ala raf  are the same righteous servants of allah who are distinctly mentioned in 561011   and the foremost are the foremost â€ ” these are drawn near to allah  . besides this  the prophets are again and again spoken of as a class by themselves  being witnesses over their people . d  463  they are  as it were  standing at the door of the garden  ready to enter it . e  47  thus do pray those who hope to enter paradise . 7  48 â€¢ helplessness of opponents 197 section 6  helplessness of opponents 48 and the owners of the elevated places call out to men whom they recognize by their marks  saying  of no avail were to you your amassings a and your arrogance . 49 are these they about whom you swore that allah would not bestow mercy on them  enter the garden  you have no fear  nor shall you grieve . 50 and the companions of the fire call out to the owners of the garden  pour on us some water or some of what allah has provided for you . they say  surely allah has forbidden them both to the disbelievers  51 who take their religion for an idle sport and a play  and this world s life deceives them . so this day we shall forsake them  as they neglected the meeting of this day of theirs  and as they denied our messages . 52 and certainly we have brought them a book which we make clear with knowledge  a guidance and a mercy for a people who believe . 53 do they wait only for its final sequel  on the day when its final sequel comes  those who neglected it before will say  indeed the messengers of our lord brought the truth . are there any intercessors on our behalf so that they should intercede for us  or could we be sent back so that we should do  deeds  other than those which we did  indeed they have lost their souls  and what they forged has failed them . section 7  the righteous will prosper 54 surely your lord is allah  who created the heavens and the earth in six periods and he is established on the throne a  48  the word used may mean either your amassing worldly wealth  or it may mean your multitude or strength in numbers . b  53  by final sequel is meant the ultimate state of the perfect manifestation of truth by the fulfilment of the prophecies  the end ox the ultimate consequence . c  541  the word yaum means not only day but also a period  whatever period it may be . the six periods of time in which the heavens and the earth are created refer in fact to the six stages in which they have grown to their present condition . in the case of the earth these six stages are detailed in 41910 . 198 7 . the elevated places â€¢ 7  55 of power .  he makes the night cover the day  which it pursues incessantly . and  he created  the sun and the moon and the stars  made subservient by his command . surely his is the creation and the command . blessed is allah  the lord of the worlds  55 call on your lord humbly and in secret . surely he does not love the transgressors . 56 and do not make mischief in the earth after its reformation  and call on him  fearing and hoping . surely the mercy of allah is near to the doers of good .  57 and he it is who sends forth the winds bearing good news before his mercy  till  when they bear a laden cloud  we drive it to a dead land  then we send down water on it  then bring forth thereby fruits of all kinds . thus do we bring forth the dead that you may be mindful 58 and the good land â€ ” its vegetation comes a  542  the true significance of the word arsh is power or control of the creation . it is not a physical throne for sitting on . the phrase  he is established on the throne of power  arsh   is used in the quran here and on six other occa sions  viz.  in 103  132  205  2559  324 and 574 . it is invariably used after mentioning the creation of the heavens and the earth and in relation to the divine control of his creation and the law and order to which the universe is made to submit by its great author  as shown by the words that follow here  his is the creation and the command . the meaning is that after creating the universe  god has not left it to run its course independently of him  but he it is whose command holds sway and who regulates the affairs as he has planned them . b  543  in the words rabh al alamin   lord of the worlds   there is also a deeper reference to the spiritual evolution of man which is being worked out under the divine plan  and the arsh is mentioned specially in this connection  as man s perfection does not consist in the working of the material laws which prevail in the universe but in the spiritual laws which are needed for his per fection . in 4015 the lord of the arsh is clearly stated to be the sender of revela tion to man to bring about his spiritual perfection . in 407 it is added   those who bear the arsh and those around it celebrate the praise of their lord and believe in him and ask protection for those who believe  . the bearers of the arsh or the throne of power are  in fact  the bearers of the divine message . c  56  the feeling which should be entertained towards allah should be a combination of fear and hope  of awe as well as love  because the fear of his dis pleasure ennobles the mind no less than the hope of his mercy . d  571  his mercy represents the rain in the physical world . e  572  the bringing forth of the spiritually dead to life through the revela tion of the quran is always likened to the bringing of the dead earth to life by rain . 759 noah 199 forth  abundantly  by the permission of its lord . and that which is inferior â€ ”  its vegetation  comes forth but scantily . thus do we repeat the messages for a people who give thanks . a section 8  noah 59 certainly we sent noah to his people  so he said  my people  serve allah  you have no god other than him . indeed i fear for you the punishment of a grievous day . 60 the chiefs of his people said  surely we see you in clear error . 61 he said  my people  there is no error in me  but i am a messenger from the lord of the worlds . 62 i deliver to you the messages of my lord  and i offer you good advice  and i know from allah what you do not know . 63 do you wonder that a reminder has come to you from your lord through a man from among you  that he may warn you and that you may guard against evil  and that mercy may be shown to you  64 but they called him a liar  so we delivered him and those with him in the ark  and we drowned those who rejected our messages . surely they were a blind people  c the wind bearing the good news was the movement towards islam  which was daily becoming more and more powerful . a  58  revelation is here likened to the rain and the good or bad nature of man to good or inferior land . if some people do not benefit by the revelation  it is just as some lands do not benefit by rain . b  59  having warned the opponents of the evil consequences of their oppo sition to the holy prophet  several illustrations are now given from sacred history  showing how those people were dealt with who refused to listen to the voice of the warners . the object is not to narrate history as such  but to bring out common characteristics of the histories of different nations  to mention incidents which contain prophetical allusion to the holy prophet s life and to illustrate the general warnings made regarding the ultimate consequences of the rejection of truth . the quran relates the broad facts that every prophet preached divine unity  every prophet laid stress on the doing of good  every prophet was received with severe opposition  and that every prophet ultimately succeeded in establishing the truth . c  64  see further 1 1 37 â€ ” 48 and 232729 . the quran does not support the idea of a world deluge  for it states here that noah was sent only to his people  not to all nations . only the people to whom noah was sent called him a liar  and only those were drowned who rejected the message of allah delivered through noah . 200 7 . the elevated places â€¢ 7  65 section 9  hod 65 and to ad  we sent  their brother hud .  he said  my people  serve allah  you have no god other than him . will you not then guard against evil  66 the chiefs of those who disbelieved from among his people said  certainly we see you in folly  and we certainly think you to be a liar . 67 he said  my people  there is no folly in me  but i am a messenger of the lord of the worlds . 68 i deliver to you the messages of my lord and i am a faithful adviser to you . 69 do you wonder that a reminder has come to you from your lord through a man from among you that he may warn you  and remember when he made you successors after noah s people and increased you in excellence of make . so remember the bounties of allah  that you may be successful . 70 they said  have you come to us that we may serve allah alone  and give up what our fathers used to serve  then bring us what you threaten us with  if you are truthful . 71 he said  indeed uncleanness and wrath from your lord have come upon you . do you dispute with me about names which you and your fathers have named  c allah has not sent any authority for them . so wait  i too am waiting along with you . 72 so we delivered him and those with him by mercy from us  and we cut off the roots of those who rejected our messages and were not believers . a  65  ad was the grandson of aram  mentioned in 897   who was a grand son of noah  and the tribe of ad spoken of here is called the first ad  5350   as distinguished from the tribe of thamud  which is called the second ad . this tribe lived in the desert of alahqaf  4621  which is marked on the maps of arabia and extends from oman to hadramaut . the male member of a tribe is generally spoken of as their brother  as here hod is called . the prophet hud is the eber of the bible  because hud is said to be the grandson of arphaxad  the grandson of noah . compare genesis 1024 for eber s genealogy . b  69  by making them khulafa  or successors is meant that they were made a ruling nation and possessors of a vast kingdom . c  71  the reference here is to their deities . d  72  they were destroyed by a storm  697  . 7  73 â€¢ salih and lot 201 section 10  salih and lot 73 and to thamud  we sent  their brother salih .  he said  my people  serve allah  you have no god other than him . clear proof has indeed come to you from your lord . this is allah s she camel â€ ” a sign for you â€ ” so leave her alone to pasture in allah s earth  and do her no harm or a painful punishment will afflict you . 74 and remember when he made you successors after ad and settled you in the land â€ ” you make mansions on its plains and carve out houses in the mountains . so remember allah s bounties and do not act corruptly in the land  making mischief . 75 the arro gant chiefs of his people said to those who were weak  to those who believed from among them  do you know that salih is one sent by his lord  they said  surely we are believers in that with which he has been sent . 76 those who were arrogant said  surely we are disbelievers in what you believe . 77 then they hamstrung the shecamel and revolted against their lord s commandment  and said  salih  bring us what you threaten us with  if you are one of the messengers . 78 so the earth quake seized them  and they were motionless bodies in their abodes . 79 so he turned away from them and said  my people  indeed i delivered to you the message of my lord and gave you good advice  but you do not love good advisers . c 80 and  we sent  lot  when he said to his people  do you a  731  ad and thamud  though two nearly related tribes  were separated both as regards time and place . thamud is known after a grandson of aram  the grandson of noah . historical traces of it are met with in ptolemy . the tribe flouri shed more than two hundred years after ad  and occupied the territory known as alhijr  1580   and the plain known by the name of wadi1qura  which forms the southern boundary of syria and the northern one of arabia . salih was a des cendant in the sixth generation after thamud . b  732  it is called allah s shecamel because it was given as a sign from allah . it was an ordinary shecamel  which was given as a sign to a people . their slaying of it was a sign that they would neither accept the truth  nor cease persecu ting salih and his followers . c  79  this evidently refers to the survivors from the great disaster . d  80  lot is one of those prophets who have been maligned in the bible . he 202 7 . the elevated places  781 commit foul deeds which no one in the world did before you  81 surely you come to males with lust instead of females . indeed  you are a people exceeding bounds . 82 and the answer of his people was only that they said  turn them out of your town  surely they are a people who aspire to purity  83 so we delivered him and his followers  except his wife â€ ” she was among those who remained behind . 84 and we rained upon them a rain . a see  then  what was the end of the guilty  section 1 1  shuaib 85 and to midian  we sent  their brother shuaib . he said  my people  serve allah  you have no god other than him . clear proof indeed has come to you from your lord  so give full measure and weight and do not diminish to people their things nor make mischief in the land after its reform . this is better for you  if you are believers . 86 nor lie in wait on every road  threatening and turning away from allah s way him who believes in him and seeking to make it crooked . and remember when you were few  then he multiplied you  and see what was the end of the mischief makers  87 and if there are some of you who believe in what i am sent with  and others who do not believe  then wait patiently till allah judges between us  and he is the best of judges . 88 the arrogant chiefs of his people said  we will certainly 3 turn you out  shuaib  and those who believe with you from our town  or you shall come back to our religion . he said  even though we dislike  it   89 indeed we should have forged a lie against allah  was considered a righteous servant by abraham  genesis  1823   but a little further on in the same book we are told that lot was guilty of incestuous inter course with his daughters . the record there has evidently been manipulated . a  84  the punishment which overtook the people of lot is frequently called rain  while in 1182 and 1574 stones are said to have been rained down upon them . see also 5434 . it was a volcanic eruption combined with an earthquake . b  851  shuaib was a descendant of abraham in the fifth generation . it is generally supposed to be another name for jethro of the bible  exodus  31  . c  852  the injunction do not diminish to people their things stands for not depriving or defrauding people of their rights . â–º0 ss 7  90 â€¢ shuaib 203 if we go back to your religion after allah has delivered us from it . and it is not for us to go back to it  unless allah our lord please . our lord comprehends all things in his knowledge . in allah do we trust . our lord  decide between us and our people with truth  and you are the best of deciders . 90 and the chiefs of his people  who disbelieved  said  if you follow shuaib  you are surely losers . 91 so the earthquake overtook them  and they were motion less bodies in their homes â€ ” 92 those who called shuaib a liar were as though they had never dwelt there â€ ” those who called shuaib a liar  they were the losers . 93 so he turned away from them and said  my people  indeed i delivered to you the messages of my lord and i gave you good advice  how  then  should i be sorry for a disbelieving people  section 12  makkans warned of punishment 94 and we did not send a prophet to a town but we seized its people with distress and affliction that they might humble them selves .  95 then we changed the evil for good  till they became affluent and said  distress and happiness did indeed touch our fathers . so we took them by surprise while they did not perceive . 96 and if the people of the towns had believed and kept their duty  we would certainly have opened for them blessings from the heavens and the earth . but they rejected  so we seized them for what they earned . 97 are the people of the towns  then  secure from our punishment coming to them by night while they sleep  98 0r  are the people of the towns secure from our punishment coming to them in the morning while they play   are they secure from allah s plan  but none feels secure from allah s plan except the people who perish . a  94  that the histories of the nations are meant as a warning to all oppo nents of truth is evident . it is also plain that even afflictions and distress sent on a people are meant for their spiritual betterment  that they might humble themselves . b  98  the playing may be taken either literally or it may indicate the worldly engagements in which they were occupied to the utter neglect of higher aspirations . 204 7 . the elevated places â€¢ 7  100 section 13  moses sent to pharaoh with signs 100 is it not clear to those who inherit the earth after its  former  residents that  if we please  we would afflict them for their sins  and seal their hearts so they would not hear  101 such were the towns some of whose news we have related to you . and certainly their messengers came to them with clear arguments  but they would not believe what they had rejected before . thus does allah seal the hearts of the disbelievers . 102 and we did not find in most of them  faithfulness to  covenant  and we found most of them to be transgressors . 103 then  after them  we sent moses  with our messages to pharaoh and his chiefs  but they disbelieved them . see  then  what was the end of the mischiefmakers  104 and moses said  o pharaoh  surely i am a messenger from the lord of the worlds  iâ° 5 worthy of not saying anything about allah except the truth . i have come to you indeed with clear proof from your lord  so let the children of israel go with me . iâ° 6 he said  if you have come with a sign  produce it  if you are truthful . 107 so he threw down his staff  then lo  it was an obvious snake . 108 and he drew forth his hand  and lo  it was white to the onlookers . a  103  the history of moses is here taken up in detail . the holy prophet muhammad had more in common with moses than with any other prophet  and he is called the like of moses in the mosaic prophecies . b  108  it is nowhere stated that whenever moses threw down his rod it turned into a snake . only on two occasions the rod is stated to have turned into a snake   1  when moses held communion with god before going to pharaoh   2  when he first came before pharaoh  or when pharaoh summoned the enchan ters to his help . on the first of these occasions the rod was seen turning into a snake by moses alone  when he was in a state of vision â€ ” the state in which a prophet is temporarily transported to a spiritual sphere . on the latter occasion others besides moses witnessed the change  but it is a fact that the effect of inspired vision is sometimes so strong that others besides the seer partake in it . whatever their real nature  these miracles of moses were not mere play . the great truth underlying the rod or staff turning into a snake was that the followers of moses  as represented by his rod  would prevail over their enemies  and the sig nificance underlying the whitening of moses  hand was that his arguments would shine forth with clearness . 7  109 â€¢ pharaoh summons enchanters 205 section 14  pharaoh summons enchanters 109 the chiefs of pharaoh s people said  surely this is a skilful enchanter  110 he intends to turn you out of your land .  pharaoh said   what do you advise  m they said  put him off and his brother  and send heralds into the cities  112 to bring to you every skilful enchanter . 113 and the enchanters came to pharaoh  saying  we must surely have a reward if we prevail . 114 he said  yes  and you shall certainly be among those who are near  to me  . 115 they said  moses  will you throw  or shall we  be the first to  throw  116 he said  you throw . so when they threw  they decei ved the people s eyes and overawed them  and they produced a mighty enchantment . 117 and we revealed to moses  throw down jour staff . then lo  it swallowed up their lies . 118 so the truth was established  and what they did became null . 119 there they were defeated  and they went back humiliated . 120 and the enchanters fell down prostrate â€ ” 121 they said  we believe in the lord of the worlds  122 the lord of moses and aaron . 123 pharaoh said  you believe in him before i give you per mission  surely this is a plot which you have plotted in the city  to turn out of it its people  but you shall know  n4 i shall certainly cut off your hands and your feet on opposite sides  then i shall crucify you all together  125 they said  surely to our lord do we return . m and you take revenge on us only because we believed in the messages of our lord when they came to us . our lord  pour out on us patience and cause us to die in submission  to you    a  126  the bible does not speak of the magicians as believing in the divine mission of moses when they were vanquished  but according to rabbinical litera ture  some egyptians accompanied moses when he departed from egypt . it should be noted that the magicians could not have believed unless they had heard the arguments of moses as to the existence of god and as to a life after death in which they now believed so staunchly that they were ready to sacrifice their very lives for their faith . it shows that moses had explained the essential religious truths to the whole gathering before he showed the signs . 206 7 . the elevated places â€¢ 7  127 section 15  persecution of israelites continues 127 and the chiefs of pharaoh s people said  will you leave moses and his people to make mischief in the land and forsake you and your gods  he said  we will kill their sons and spare their women  and surely we are dominant over them . 128 moses said to his people  ask help from allah and be patient . surely the land is allah s â€ ” he gives it for an inheritance to such of his servants as he pleases . and the end is for those who keep their duty . 129 they said  we were persecuted before you came to us and since you have come to us . he said  it may be that your lord will destroy your enemy and make you rulers in the land  then he will see how you act . a section 16  moses shows more signs 130 and certainly we overtook pharaoh s people with droughts and shortage of fruits that they might be mindful . 131 but when good befell them they said  this is due to us . and when evil afflicted them  they attributed it to the illluck of moses and those with him . surely their evil fortune is only from allah  but most of them do not know . 132 and they said  whatever sign you may bring us to charm us with it â€ ” we shall not believe in you . 133 so we sent upon them widespread death  and the locusts and the lice and the frogs and the blood â€ ” clear signs . but they behaved haughtily and they were a guilty people . 134 and when the plague fell upon them  they said  moses  pray for us to your lord as he has made promise with you . if you remove the plague from us  we will certainly believe in you and will let the children of israel go with you . 135 but when we re moved the plague from them till a term which they should attain  a  129  by the land is meant the promised land  for it was there that moses was taking them . their being made rulers in the land was conditional upon their doing good  this is suggested in the concluding words of the verse . b  131  their evil fortune is from allah means that the misfortunes which they were made to suffer were brought about by allah as a result of their own evil deeds . 7  136 â€¢ moses shows more signs 207 lo  they broke  their promise  .  136 so we exacted retribution from them and drowned them in the sea  because they rejected our signs and were heedless of them . 137 and we made the people who were considered weak to inherit the eastern lands and the western ones which we had blessed . and the good word of your lord was fulfilled in the children of israel â€ ” because of their patience . and we destroyed what pharaoh and his people had produced and what they had built . 138 and we took the children of israel across the sea . then they came to a people who were devoted to their idols . they said  moses  make for us a god as they have gods . e he said  surely you are an ignorant people  139  as to  these  what they are engaged in shall be destroyed and what they do is futile . 140 he said  shall i seek for you a god other than allah  while he has made you excel  all  created things  i 41 and when we delivered you from pharaoh s people  who subjected you to severe torment  killing your sons and sparing your women . and in it there was a great trial from your lord . section 17  moses receives the law 142 and we appointed for moses thirty nights  and completed them with ten  so the appointed time of his lord was complete a  135  a reference to exodus  ch . 8â€ ” 11  will show that pharaoh again and again broke his promise to let the children of israel go â€ ” promises which he made on condition that a certain affliction should be removed . b  137  the land that was blessed is none other than the holy land  for which a divine promise was given to abraham . the good word referred to here is that contained in genesis 178 . the eastern and the western lands might signify the eastern and the western tracts of the holy land  or the lands on the eastern and western sides of the jordan . c  138  the israelites undoubtedly came across idolatrous nations in their wanderings . they themselves had idolatrous leanings   ... the people gathered together to aaron  and said to him  come  make us gods that shall go before us   exodus  321  . many other anecdotes show a similar tendency to idolworship . rf  140  moses  argument against idolatry is the one to which the quran repeatedly calls attention  namely  that man  being as it were the lord of creation under god  and excelling the whole of creation  should not take objects lower than himself as his gods . 208 7 . the elevated places â€¢ 7  143 forty nights . and moses said to his brother aaron  take my place among my people  and act well and do not follow the way of the mischiefmakers . 143 and when moses came at our appointed time and his lord spoke to him  he said  my lord  show me  yourself  so that i may look at you . he said  fou can not see me  but look at the mountain  if it remains firm in its place  then will you see me . so when his lord manifested his glory to the mountain  he made it crumble and moses fell down fainting .  then when he recovered  he said  glory be to you  i turn to you  and i am the first of the believers . 144 he said  o moses  surely i have chosen you above the people by my messages and my words . so take hold of what i give you and be of the grateful ones . 145 and we ordained for him in the tablets admonition of every kind and clear explanation of all things . so take hold of these  teachings  with firmness and command your people to take hold of the best of these . i shall show you the abode of the trans gressors . 146 i shall turn away from my messages those who are unjustly proud in the earth . and if they see every sign  they will not believe in it  and if they see the way of rectitude  they do not take it for a way  and if they see the way of error  they take it for a way . this is because they reject our messages and are heedless of them . 147 and those who reject our messages and the meeting of a  143  the words you can not see me negative the seeing of the divine being with the physical eye . moses  request seems to have been based on the elders  demand spoken of in 255 . i venture  however  another explanation . what moses wanted to see was the great manifestation of divine glory which was reser ved for the holy prophet muhammad . in fact  both moses and jesus were not equal to the task which was reserved for the prophet muhammad . jesus said that he could not teach his followers all things  but that when the comforter made his appearance he would guide them into all truth . that moses was unequal to the holy prophet s task was clearly demonstrated by his falling down in a swoon when he beheld the great manifestation . b  1451  the words admonition of every kind and explanation of all things can not be taken generally  but are limited by the requirements of the time in which moses appeared . c  1452  the meaning is that a time will come to the israelites when they will become transgressors  i.e . they will not keep the divine commandments . 7  148 â€¢ israelites worship a calf 209 the hereafter â€ ” their deeds are fruitless . can they be rewarded except for what they do  section 18  israelites worship a calf 148 and moses  people made of their ornaments a calf after him â€ ” a  lifeless  body  having a lowing sound .  could they not see that it did not speak to them  nor guided them in the way  they took it  for worship  and they were unjust . 149 and when they repented and saw that they had gone astray  they said  if our lord have not mercy on us and forgive us  we shall certainly be losers . 150 and when moses returned to his people  angry  grieved  he said  evil is what you have done after me  did you hasten on the judgment of your lord  and he threw down the tablets and seized his brother by the head  dragging him towards him .  aaron  said  son of my mother  the people reckoned me weak and had almost killed me . so do not make the enemies to rejoice over me and do not count me among the unjust people . 151  moses  said  my lord  forgive me and my brother  and admit us to your mercy  and you are the most merciful of those who show mercy .  section 19  the torah and the prophet s advent 152 those who took the calf  for a god  â€ ” wrath from their lord  and disgrace in this world s life  will surely come upon them . a  148  the word jasad means a body  as well as red or intensely yellow . the former meaning indicates that the calf was a mere lifeless body  yet it was so made that it gave a lowing sound like that of a calf . the other meaning also pro vides a true description of the calf as it was made of gold ornaments . b  149  the israelites  repentance  though mentioned first  was subsequent to moses  return  254  . the order here connects the repentance with the sin . c  151  aaron s excuse and moses  acceptance of it show clearly that aaron was quite innocent  having had a share neither in making the calf nor in wor shipping it . the bible account  which makes a righteous prophet of god guilty of the most heinous crime  must be rejected as untrue . that forgiveness was not sought for any fault in connection with calfworship is clear from the fact that moses joins himself with aaron in the prayer given in this verse . forgiveness here  as frequently elsewhere in the quran  is equivalent to the divine protection which everyone should seek against the shortcomings of human nature . 210 7 . the elevated places  7153 and thus do we recompense those who invent lies . 153 and those who do evil deeds  then repent after that and believe â€ ” your lord after that is surely forgiving  merciful . 154 and when moses  anger calmed down  he took up the tablets  and in the writing thereof was guidance and mercy for those who fear their lord . 155 and moses chose of his people seventy men for our appointment .  so when the earthquake struck them  he said  my lord  if you had pleased  you would have destroyed them before and myself  too  . will you destroy us for what the foolish among us have done  it is only your trial . you cause to perish by it whom you please and guide whom you please . you are our pro tector  so forgive us and have mercy on us  and you are the best of those who forgive . 156 and ordain for us good in this world s life and in the hereafter  for surely we turn to you . he said  i afflict with my punishment whom i please  and my mercy encom passes all things . so i ordain it for those who keep their duty and give the due charity  and those who believe in our messages â€ ” 1s7 those who follow the messengerprophet  the umml  c whom they find mentioned in the torah and the gospel . he enjoins a  155  exodus 24  1 speaks of moses having taken up seventy elders of israel along with him  though they were forbidden to  come near the lord   and on this occasion moses was in the mountain forty days and forty nights  exodus  2418  . although the bible also speaks of moses as going to the mountain for forty days and forty nights after the incident of the calfworship  exodus  3428   the quran refers only to the first occasion . b  156  no attribute of god receives such prominence in the quran as the attribute of mercy â€ ” my mercy encompasses all things . even punishment is a phase of divine mercy because it seeks to correct the evildoers . c  1571  ummt means one who neither writes nor reads a writing . hence the arabs are called an ummt people  and the ummt prophet is either the prophet of the ummt people  i.e . the arabs  because he was like them  or he was so called because he himself did not know reading and writing . but according to some  the prophet is called ummt because he came from the umm alqura  i.e . makkah  which is the metropolis of arabia . d  1572  there are many prophecies regarding the advent of the holy pro phet in the bible . the torah and the gospel are specially mentioned here because moses and jesus were respectively the first and the last of the israelite prophets . deuteronomy 181518 speaks very clearly of the raising of a prophet  who shall 7158  divine favours on israelites 2 1 1 them good and forbids them evil  and makes lawful to them the good things and prohibits for them impure things  and removes from them their burden and the shackles which were on them . so those who believe in him and honour him and help him  and follow the light which has been sent down with him â€ ” these are the successful . section 20  divine favours on israelites 158 say  o mankind  surely i am the messenger of allah to you all  of him whose is the kingdom of the heavens and the earth .  there is no god but he  he gives life and causes death . so believe in allah and his messenger  the ummt prophet who believes in allah and his words  and follow him so that you may be guided aright . 159 and of moses  people is a party who guide with truth and with it they do justice .  i fi0 and we divided them into twelve tribes  as nations . and we revealed to moses when his people asked him for water  march on to the rock with jour staff  so out flowed from it twelve springs . each tribe knew its drinkingplace . and we made the clouds to give shade over them and we sent to them manna and quails . eat of the good things we have given be the like of moses  from among the brethren of the israelites  i.e . the ishmaelites or the arabs  while deuteronomy 332 speaks of the shining forth of the manifes tation of the lord  i.e . his coming in full glory  from mount paran  . the gospel is full of prophecies of the advent of the holy prophet  matthew 21 3344  mark 12111  luke 20918  where the lord of the vineyard comes after the son  i.e . jesus  is maltreated  and matthew 133132  john 121  john 1416  john 1426 all contain such prophecies . a  158  as against the various prophets spoken of in this chapter  every one of whom was sent to his people  the prophet muhammad is here spoken of as hav ing been sent to all people  to the whole of mankind . thus the appearance of the prophet muhammad was a turning point in the history of humanity . the day of the national prophet was over and a new era had dawned in which the whole of humanity was ultimately to be united under one spiritual head . the idea of nation ality had to give place to the broader idea of one humanity  and the basis of it was laid by the quran . b  159  thus the quran recognizes that there were good people among the jews . see also v. 168 . 212 7 . the elevated places  7161 you . and they did not do us any harm  but they wronged their own souls . 161 and when it was said to them  dwell in this town and eat from it wherever you wish  and make petition for forgiveness  and enter the gate submissively  we shall forgive you your wrongs . we shall give more to the doers of good . 162 but those who were unjust among them changed it for a word other than that which they were told  so we sent upon them a pestilence from heaven for their wrongdoing section 21  israelites  transgressions 163 and ask them about the town which stood by the sea . when they violated the sabbath  when their fish came to them on their sabbath day on the surface  and when it was not their sabbath they did not come to them . thus did we try them because they transgressed . 164 and when some of them said  why do you preach to a people whom allah would destroy or whom he would punish with a severe punishment  they said  to be free from blame before your lord  and that perhaps they may guard against evil . 165 so when they neglected what they had been reminded of  we delivered those who forbade evil and we overtook those who were wrongdoers with an evil punishment because they trans gressed . 166 so when they revoltingly persisted in what they had been forbidden  we said to them  be  as  apes  despised and hated . 167 and when your lord declared that he would send against them to the day of resurrection those who would subject them to severe torment . surely jour lord is quick in retribution  and surely he is forgiving  merciful . 168 and we divided them in the earth into a  162  for the statements made in v. 160162  see 25760 and footnotes . b  163  the city referred to here is generally recognized as being ela  which was situated on the red sea . the incident alluded to is mentioned as an instance of the jewish violation of the sabbath . the fish appeared on the surface of the water on the sabbath because they had a sense of security on that day . this was a temptation for the people to break the law . 7  169 â€¢ israelites  transgressions 213  different  groups â€ ” some of them are righteous and some of them are otherwise . and we tried them with blessings and misfortunes that they might turn . 169 then after them came an evil generation who inherited the book  taking the frail goods of this low life and saying  it will be forgiven us . and if  more  such good came to them  they would take it  too  . a was not a promise taken from them in the book that they would not speak anything about allah but the truth  and they study what is in it . and the abode of the hereafter is better for those who keep their duty . do you not then understand  170 and as for those who hold fast by the book and keep up prayer â€ ” surely we do not waste the reward of the reformers . m and when we shook the mountain over them as if it were a covering  and they thought that it was going to fall down upon them  hold on firmly what we have given you  and bear in mind what is in it  so that you may guard against evil . 4 section 22  evidence of divine impress on man s nature 172 and when jour lord brought forth from the children of adam  from their loins  their descendants  and made them bear witness about themselves  am i not your lord  they said  yes  we bear witness . c in case you should say on the day of resurrection  we were unaware of this  173 or you should say  only our fathers a  169  first they commit a crime for the frail goods of this life  saying that they will be forgiven  then persist in their evil course and when a similar occasion arises  they again return to the old crimes . there is no repentance . b  171  the stories built upon these simple words by some commentators must be rejected . the words simply relate the experience of the elders of israel when they stood at the foot of the mountain  which rose above them . there was a severe earthquake  which is referred to in v. 155  causing them to think that the mountain would fall down upon them . c  172  the verse does not mention the bringing forth of descendants from adam  but from the children of adam  and this seems clearly to refer to every human being as he comes into existence . the evidence is  therefore  given by human nature itself . it is  in fact  the same evidence which is elsewhere spoken of as being afforded by human nature as in  the nature made by allah in which he has created mankind   3030  . 214 7 . the elevated places â€¢ 7  174 set up partners  with allah  before  us   and we were  their  descendants after them . will you destroy us for what liars did  174 and thus do we make the messages clear  and that perhaps they may return . 175 and recite to them the news of him to whom we give our messages  but he withdraws himself from them  so the devil follows him up  and he is of those who perish .  176 and if we had pleased  we would have exalted him thereby  but he clings to the earth and follows his low desire . his parable is as the parable of the dog â€ ” if you drive him away  he lolls out his tongue  and if you leave him alone  he lolls out his tongue . such is the parable of the people who reject our messages . so relate the narrative that they may reflect . 177 evil is the likeness of the people who reject our messages and wrong their own souls . 178 he whom allah guides is on the right way  and he whom he leaves in error â€ ” they are the losers . 179 and certainly we have created for hell many of the jinn and the people â€ ” they have hearts with which they do not under stand  and they have eyes with which they do not see  and they have ears with which they do not hear . c they are as cattle  rather  they are more astray . these are the heedless ones . 180 and allah s are the best names  so call on him thereby d and leave alone those a  175  this verse speaks generally of everyone to whom guidance is brought but he turns aside from it . this view is corroborated by what is stated at the con clusion of the parable in v. 176  such is the parable of the people who reject our messages . b  176  earth here stands for all that is earthly  for things material . the people spoken of here are those who do not care for the higher values of life . c  179  many people and jinn are created for hell  but they are none other than the heedless ones who do not care for what is said . allah has not created them differently from others  but they themselves do not use the faculties which allah has granted them . d  1801  by the best names are meant names expressing the most excellent attributes of the divine being . by calling on him thereby is meant that man should always keep the divine attributes before his mind  endeavouring to possess those attributes . 7181  the coming of the doom 2 1 5 who violate the sanctity of his names .  they will be recompensed for what they do . 181 and of those whom we have created is a community who guide with the truth and with it they do justice . section 23  the coming of the doom 182 and those who reject our messages â€ ” we lead them  to destruction  step by step from where they do not know . 183 and i grant them respite . surely my scheme is effective . 184 do they not reflect  that  there is no madness in their companion  he is only a plain warner . 185 do they not consider the kingdom of the heavens and the earth and what things allah has created  and that it may be that their doom has drawn near  in what announcement after this will they then believe  186 whomsoever allah leaves in error  there is no guide for him . and he leaves them alone in their inordinacy  blindly wandering on . 187 they ask you about the hour  c when will it take place  say  its knowledge is with my lord only . none but he will mani fest it at its time . it is momentous in the heavens and the earth . it will not come to you but suddenly . they ask you as if you could find out about it  by effort  . say  its knowledge is with allah only  but most people do not know . 188 say  i do not control benefit nor harm for myself except as allah please . and if i had known the unseen  i should have much of good  and no evil would touch me . i am but a warner and the giver of good news to a people who believe . a  1802  violation of the sanctity of his names is of two kinds  firstly  giving him an improper or inaccurate attribute  and secondly  to interpret his attributes in a manner which does not befit him . b  183  the word kaid  scheme   in relation to god  indicates skill in the management or ordering of affairs . c  187  that is  the hour with which they are threatened as being the hour of their doom . the word sa ah or the hour is used in the quran to indicate both the doom of the guilty in this life and the time when a perfect manifestation of rewards and punishments will take place in the hereafter . rf  188  the simplicity and nobility of this statement as indicating the mission of a prophet is unsurpassed . he gives glad news of triumph to those who 216 7 . the elevated places â€¢ 7  189 section 24  the final word 189 he it is who created you from a single soul  and of the same did he make his mate  that he might find comfort in her . so when he covers her she bears a light burden  then moves about with it . then when it grows heavy  they both call upon allah  their lord  if you give us a good one  we shall certainly be grateful . 190 but when he gives them a good one  they set up with him part ners in what he has given them .  supremely exalted is allah above what they set up as partners  with him  . 191 do they set up  with him  that which has not created anything  while they are them selves created  192 and they can not give them help  nor can they help themselves . 193 and if you invite them to guidance  they will not follow you . it is the same to you whether you invite them or you are silent . 194 those whom you call on besides allah are slaves like your selves  so call on them  then let them answer you  if you are truthful . 195 do they have feet with which they walk  or do they have hands with which they hold  or do they have eyes with which they see  or do they have ears with which they hear  say  call upon your associategods then plot against me and give me no respite . 196 surely my friend is allah  who revealed the book  and he befriends the righteous . 197 and those whom you call upon besides him are not able to help you  nor can they help them selves . 198 and if you invite them to guidance  they do not hear  and you see them looking towards you  yet they do not see . 199 take to forgiveness and enjoin good and turn away from the ignorant . believe  warns the evildoers of the evil consequences of their deeds in this life as well as in the next  but he does not claim the possession of divine powers . a  190  this describes the condition of man in general and refers to the evidence of his nature  for when in distress he always turns to allah  but when in ease he goes after other gods or his own low desires . b  193  invitation to truth must be extended to all  though some may not benefit by it . the meaning is further clarified in verses 198199 . 7  200 â€¢ the final word 2 1 7 200 and if a false imputation from the devil afflict .you   seek refuge in allah . surely he is hearing  knowing . 201 those who guard against evil  when a visitation from the devil afflicts them  they become mindful  then lo  they see . 202 and their brethren c increase them in error  then they do not cease . 203 and when you do not bring them a sign  they say  why do you not demand it  say  i follow only what is revealed to me from my lord . these are clear proofs from your lord and a guidance and a mercy for a people who believe . 204 and when the quran is recited  listen to it and remain silent  that mercy may be shown to you . 205 and remember your lord within yourself humbly and fearing  and in a voice not loud  in the morning and the evening  and do not be one of the heedless . 206 surely those who are with your lord are not too proud to serve him  and they glorify him and prostrate themselves before him . a  200  the devil in this case  as frequently in the quran  stands for the devilish enemies who spread all kinds of false reports concerning the holy pro phet  against which he is told to seek refuge in allah . b  201  the visitation of the devil means the happening of any grievous inci dent or the coming of an affliction from the hands of the devil  or the wicked acting in opposition to the righteous . being endowed with insight  they see their way out of the affliction . the devil s visitation may also signify anger which blinds a man  and those who guard against evil are not blinded by it . c  202  that is  the brethren of the devils  or the devil s human associates . chapter 8 aianfai voluntary gifts this chapter deals with the battle of badr  the first battle which the muslims had to fight  and it goes under the name of anfal  literally voluntary gifts  because the muslim state had at the time no treasury  nor any arsenal  nor an army and voluntary gifts were therefore called for . it was not only this battle but all the succeeding battles which muslims had to fight were carried on only by voluntary gifts . success in this battle  against all odds  provided proof of the truth of the holy prophet s mission and thus this chapter occurs after a dis cussion of prophethood in the last chapter . most of this chapter was revealed in 2 a.h.  while the concluding verses of sections 7 and 8 were revealed around the time of the conquest of makkah in 8 a.h . section 1  the battle of badr â€ ” muslims go forth in the name of allah  the beneficent  the merciful . 1 they ask you about voluntary gifts . say  voluntary gifts are for allah and the messenger so keep your duty to allah and set aright your differences  and obey allah and his messenger  if you are believers . 2 they only are believers whose hearts are full of fear when allah is mentioned  and when his messages are recited to them they increase them in faith  and in their lord do they trust  3 those who keep up prayer and spend  on good works  out of what we have given them . 4 these are the believers truly . for them are with their lord exalted grades and protection and an honourable sustenance . a  1  there is much difference of opinion among the commentators as to what is meant by anfal here . the most generally received opinion is that it means property acquired during the war . i take the word anfal as carrying here its literal significance of voluntary gifts for the advancement of the cause of islam  such voluntary gifts being most needed at a time when the very life of islam was threat ened . indeed there is no better justification for a war than that it is carried on by the voluntary gifts of those whose life is in danger . it is the only war that is really carried on by the people in selfdefence . 218 85  the battle of badr 219 5 even as your lord caused you to go forth from your house with truth  though some of the believers were surely averse   disputing with you about the truth after it had become clear â€ ” as if they were being driven to death while they saw  it  . 7 and when allah promised you one of the two parties that it should be yours  and you loved that the one not armed should be yours  and allah desired to establish the truth by his words  c and to cut off the root of the disbelievers â€ ” 8 that he might cause the truth to triumph and bring falsehood to failure  though the guilty disliked . 9 when you sought the aid of your lord  so he answered you  i will assist you with a thousand of the angels following one an other . 10 and allah gave it only as good news  and that your hearts a  5  the circumstances of the battle of badr have been misunderstood . it is alleged that the holy prophet had made preparations for attacking an unarmed caravan of the quraish on its way back from syria to makkah  when abu sufyan  the caravan leader  sent word to makkah and obtained an escort of nearly a thousand men . if the holy prophet had desired to plunder the caravan when it approached madinah  he would have done so long before abu sufyan could obtain assistance from makkah  as madinah was thirteen days  journey from makkah . badr lies at a distance of three days  journey from madinah . the enemy had marched forth for ten days and the muslims only for three days when the two forces encountered each other at badr  which shows clearly that the muslims had turned out to take the defensive against an invading force . it is clearly stated here that some of the believers were averse to fighting . they could not have been averse if they had to encounter only an unarmed caravan . it is said in the next verse that they went forth as if they were being driven to death . they knew that they were going to meet an enemy treble in numbers and much more powerful and efficient . b  71  the two parties referred to were the unarmed caravan of the quraish going to makkah and the armed force of the quraish that was on its way to madinah . naturally  some of the muslims desired that their encounter should take place with the unarmed quraish caravan . c  72  by his words is meant here the fulfilment of his words  because the holy prophet had declared at makkah long before that an encounter would take place between the muslims and the quraish  in which the former would be victo rious . the holy prophet himself repeated one of these prophecies aloud in the field when he prayed on the day of badr   soon shall the armies be routed  and they will show their backs   5445  . 220 8 . voluntary gifts 811 might be at ease by it . a and victory is only from allah  surely allah is mighty  wise . section 2  the battle of badr â€ ” fighting 11 when he made slumber fall on you as a security from him  and sent down upon you water from the clouds that he might purify you with it   and take away from you the uncleanness of the devil  and that he might fortify your hearts and make firm  your  feet by it . e 12 when jour lord revealed to the angels  i am with you  so make firm those who believe . i will cast terror into the hearts of those who disbelieve . so strike above the necks and strike every fingertip of them . 13 this is because they opposed allah and his messenger . and whoever opposes allah and his messenger â€ ” then surely allah is severe in retribution . 14 this â€ ” taste it  and  know  that for the disbelievers is the punishment of the fire . a  10  see 3124 footnote . it is nowhere stated in the quran that the angels actually fought  but here  as in 3126  we are told that the angels were sent down to bear good news of victory and to ease the hearts of the muslims . here  how ever  we are further told that  as a result of the coming of the angels  calm fell upon the muslims  their hearts being strengthened and their footsteps being steadied  v. 11   and that while the believers were thus made firm  terror was cast into the hearts of the disbelievers  v. 12  . hence it is that the number of angels corresponds with the strength of the enemy force in each case . b  111  compare 2525  which is a prophecy about the events of this remarkable battle   and on the day when the heaven bursts apart with clouds  and the angels are sent down  as they are sent  . the rainfall brought many advantages to the muslims  for which see the next footnote . c  112  before the rain fell the muslim position was very weak . the enemy had the command of the water and the muslims were in a low and sandy place . therefore there were some who had misgivings  which  as is said here  were due to the devil s uncleanness . the enemy having taken possession of the drinking water  the muslims feared being troubled by thirst  which is called the devil of the desert . the rain strengthened the position of the muslims and consequently com forted their hearts . this was a purification  for after the rainfall they all became certain of divine help and so of their triumph over the enemy . d  12  the two phrases  strike above the necks and strike the fingertips  respectively signify the killing of the enemy and disabling him so as to render him unfit for taking further part in fighting . 815  the battle of badr 221 15 o you who believe  when you meet those who disbelieve marching for war  do not turn your backs to them . 16 and whoever turns his back to them on that day â€ ” unless manoeuvring for battle or turning to join a company â€ ” he indeed incurs allah s wrath and his refuge is hell . and an evil destination it is . 17 so you did not kill them but allah killed them  and you  o prophet  did not strike when you struck  the enemy   but allah struck  him   a and that he might confer upon the believers a benefit from himself . surely allah is hearing  knowing . 18 this c â€ ” and  know  that allah will weaken the struggle of the disbelievers . 19 if you sought a judgment  the judgment has indeed come to you  and if you cease  fighting   it is better for you . and if you return  to fighting   we  too  shall return and your forces will not avail you at all  though they may be many  and  know  that allah is with the believers . section 3  the way to success 20 o you who believe  obey allah and his messenger and do not turn away from him while you hear . 21 and do not be like those who say  we hear  and they do not hear . 22 surely the vilest of beasts  in allah s sight  are the deaf  the dumb  who do a  171  rama carries a number of significances  including throwing  fling ing  assailing and striking . it is used in connection with fighting  and therefore striking is its equivalent here . the first part of the verse about killing refers to the muslims generally  the address being in the plural  and the second part  being in the singular  is understood as referring to the holy prophet . the muslims killed the enemy  but it is affirmed that really they did not kill  but it was allah who killed them  the meaning apparently being that allah s hand was working in the battle . the same applies to the other passage relating to the striking of the enemy by the holy prophet . whether the prophet actually threw a handful of pebbles at the enemy  which discomfited the latter  is a different question . it was allah s hand that killed them  and it was his hand that struck them and ultimately put them to rout . b  172  the benefit spoken of here is a victory which strengthened the foundations of islam  and dealt a deathblow to the evil designs of those who were determined to exterminate it  as is plainly stated in the next verse . c  18  this here stands for  this was the divine purpose in bringing about this encounter . 222 8 . voluntary gifts â€¢ 8  23 not understand .  23 and if allah had known any good in them  he would have made them hear . and if he makes them hear  they would turn away while they are averse . 24 o you who believe  respond to allah and his messenger  when he calls you to that which gives you life .  and know that allah comes in between a man and his heart   and that to him you will be gathered . 25 and guard yourselves against an affliction which may not strike those of you exclusively who are wrong doers  and know that allah is severe in retribution . 26 and remember when you were few  considered weak in the land  fearing if people should carry you off by force  he shel tered you and strengthened you with his help  and gave you good things that you might give thanks . 27 you who believe  do not be unfaithful to allah and the messenger  nor be unfaithful to your trusts  while you know . 28 and know that your wealth and your children are a temptation  and that allah is he with whom there is a mighty reward . section 4  muslims to be guardians of the sacred mosque 29 o you who believe  if you keep your duty to allah  he will grant you a distinction and do away with your evils and protect you . and allah is the lord of mighty grace . 30 and when those a  22  the deaf and the dumb signify those who are spiritually deaf and dumb â€ ” those who do not understand . b  241  faith or submission to allah is life  and disbelief is death . by the expression that which gives you life some understand the quran  others take it to meanjihad  or exertion in the cause of truth . evidently it is faith . c  242  by heart is meant the desires of the heart . the divine intervention is the cutting off of those desires . the faithful are enjoined to be quick in respond ing to the call of the holy prophet  and not to indulge in worldly desires  for these may soon be cut off . or  the meaning is that they must respond to the call of the holy prophet in case  having deprived themselves of one occasion of doing good  the heart should be hardened  and  as a punishment for the first rejection  allah may so turn it that it may not turn to good at all . d  25  this refers to afflictions that are of such a widespread nature as to overtake even others  in addition to those for whom they are primarily intended . 831  guardians of the sacred mosque 223 who disbelieved devised plans against you that they might confine you or kill you or drive you away â€ ” and they devised plans and allah  too  had arranged a plan  and allah is the best of planners.  31 and when our messages are recited to them  they say  we have heard . if we wished  we could say the like of it  this is nothing but the stories of the ancients . 32 and when they said  o allah  if this is indeed the truth from you  then rain down on us stones from heaven or inflict on us a painful punishment . 33 and allah would not punish them while you were among them  nor would allah punish them while they seek forgiveness . e 34 and what excuse have they that allah should not punish them while they hinder  people  from the sacred mosque and they are not its  true  guardians  its guardians are only those who keep their duty  but most of them do not know. 35 and their prayer at the house is nothing but whistling and clapping of hands . 2 taste  then  the punishment  because you disbelieved . 36 surely those who disbelieve spend their wealth to hinder  people  from the way of allah . so they will go on spending it  then it will be to them a regret  then they will be overcome . and those who disbelieve will be gathered together to hell  37 that allah a  30  the reference is to the final plans of the quraish when  the com panions having emigrated to madinah  the prophet was left alone at makkah . the divine plan was that the disbelievers should see the downfall of their power at the hands of the prophet . b  31  that this was an empty boast is confirmed by the fact that  although the quran repeatedly challenged them to produce anything like it  they could not produce even the like of its shortest chapter . c  33  the punishment was to overtake them when the holy prophet was no more among them  i.e . after his flight from makkah . but even then the punish ment might be averted if they asked for forgiveness . d  34  the words contain a prophecy not only as to the deprivation of the disbelieving quraish of the guardianship of the kabah  but also as to the passing of the guardianship into the hands of the muslims . e  35  in fact the house was not used by them for offering prayers to god but for sacrilegious talk and gossiping . 0 â£0 224 8 . voluntary gifts â€¢ 8  38 may separate the wicked from the good  and put the wicked upon one another  then heap them together  then cast them into hell . these indeed are the losers . section 5  badr as sign of the prophet s truth 38 say to those who disbelieve  if they cease  fighting   what is past will be forgiven them  and if they return  to it   then the example of those of old has already gone .  39 and fight with them until there is no more persecution  and all religions are for allah . but if they cease  then surely allah is seer of what they do . 40 and if they turn back  then know that allah is your patron . most excellent the patron and most excellent the helper  41 and know that whatever you acquire in war  a fifth of it is for allah and for the messenger and for the near of kin and the orphans and the needy and the traveller if you believe in allah a  38  they had gone away from badr quite discomfited  and they were told that  if they ceased fighting  they would be forgiven . otherwise  they could read their own doom in the doom of those with whom allah had dealt previously in similar circumstances . b  39  that is  if they cease fighting and put an end to their mischief  god s decree of punishment will not be executed . the state of religious liberty which islam aimed at is put tersely in the two opening statements â€ ” there is no more persecution and all religions are for allah  everyone being at liberty to hold any belief he likes . c  411  the onefifth spoken of here is to be divided again into five parts  the prophet  the near of kin  the orphans  the poor  and the traveller being equal sharers . the near of kin included all individuals belonging to the tribes of bani hashim and bani abdul muttalib  to whom zakat money was not allowed . the poor among them were thus paid from this source of income . as to the holy prophet s twentyfifth  it was also used for the benefit of the muslims . the re maining fourfifths of the acquisitions were divided among those who took part in the battle  as they were not otherwise paid for their services  but there is no order to this effect in the quran itself . this arrangement was simply an exigency . war was forced on muslims all of a sudden when the state had not yet been properly formed  there was no army at all  nor a treasury from which to pay it  and just as they were required to carry on war on the basis of voluntary gifts  so they were allowed a share in the war acquisitions . if the state pays its soldiers as it pays its civil servants  the war acquisitions would all go to the state treasury . 8  42 â€¢ badr as sign of the prophet s truth 225 and in what we revealed to our servant  on the day of distinction  the day on which the two forces met .  and allah is powerful over all things . 42 when you were on the nearer side  of the valley  and they were on the farther side  while the caravan was in a lower place than you . and if you had tried to make a mutual appointment  you would certainly have broken away from the appointment  but c â€ ” in order that allah might bring about a matter which had to be done  that he who perished by clear argument might perish  and he who lived by clear argument might live . 6 and surely allah is hearing  knowing  43 when allah showed them to you in jour dream as few  â€ ” and if he had shown them to you as many  you  o muslims  would certainly have become weakhearted and you would have disputed about the matter  but allah saved  you  . surely he is knower of what is in the hearts . 44 and when he showed them to you  when you met  as few in your eyes  and he made you to appear few in their eyes  in order that allah might bring about a matter which had to be done . g and to allah are all affairs returned . a  412  the day of distinction  yaum alfurqan  referred to here is the battle of badr . b  421  the muslims were on the side nearer to madinah  the main army of the quraish was on the side which was farther from madinah  while the caravan was in a lower place  i.e . towards the seacoast  and farther away from madinah  on its way to makkah . c  422  there is a break here  the meaning being but an encounter was brought about without an appointment . the muslims were so weak that they could not think of making an appointment with the enemy â€ ” they would have broken away from the appointment . d  423  the matter referred to is the defeat of the opponents of islam . e  424  the disbelievers had seen clear arguments of the holy prophet s truth  yet they rejected him and had thus perished in a spiritual sense  they were now vanquished in the battle and thus perished temporally .   43  the holy prophet s seeing them few in a vision must be interpreted as signifying their actual weakness  despite their great number . g  44  here we are told that they were also shown to be few to the muslims when the two armies met . see 313 and footnote . 226 8 . voluntary gifts â€¢ 8  45 section 6  success does not depend on numbers 45 o you who believe  when you meet an army  be firm  and remember allah much  that you may be successful . 46 and obey allah and his messenger and do not dispute with one another so that you get weakhearted and your power departs  and be stead fast . surely allah is with the steadfast . 47 and do not be like those who came forth from their homes exultingly and to be seen by people  and they hinder  people  from the way of allah .  and allah encompasses what they do . 48 and when the devil made their works seem good to them  and said  no man can overcome you this day  and i am your protector . but when the two armies came in sight of one another  he turned upon his heels  and said  surely i am clear of you  i see what you do not see  surely i fear allah . and allah is severe in retribution . section 7  enemy s strength weakened 49 and when the hypocrites and those in whose hearts is a disease said  their religion has deluded them . and whoever trusts in allah  then surely allah is mighty  wise . 50 and if you could see when the angels cause to die those who disbelieve  striking their faces and their backs  and  saying   taste the punishment of burning . 51 this is for what your hands have sent ahead  and because allah is not in the least unjust to the servants â€ ” 52 in the manner of the people of pharaoh and those before them  they disbelieved in allah s messages  so allah punished them for their sins . surely allah is strong  severe in retribution . 53 this is because allah never changes a favour which he has conferred upon a people until they change their own condition â€ ” and because allah is hearing  knowing â€ ” 54 in the manner of the people of pharaoh  and those before them . they rejected the messages of their lord  a  47  this clearly refers to the army of the quraish which had marched forth in great exultation to destroy madinah . b  48  the person referred to here as the devil is said to have been suraqa ibn malik who gave the quraish promise of help . however  what is stated here may only be the devil s suggestion to the quraish leaders . 855  peace to be secured by strength 227 so we destroyed them for their sins . and we drowned pharaoh s people and they were all wrongdoers . 55 surely the vilest of beasts in allah s sight are those who disbelieve  then they would not believe â€ ” 56 those with whom you make an agreement  then they break their agreement every time  and they do not keep their duty .  57 so if   ou overtake them in war  scatter by them those who are behind them  that they may be mind ful . 58 and if you fear treachery on the part of a people  throw back to them  their treaty  on terms of equality . surely allah does not love the treacherous . c section 8  peace to be secured by strength 59 and those who disbelieve should not think that they can outstrip  us  . surely they can not escape . 60 and make ready for them whatever force you can and horses tied at the frontier  to frighten thereby the enemy of allah and your enemy and others besides them  whom you do not know â€ ” allah knows them . and whatever you spend in allah s way  it will be paid back to you fully and you will not be wronged . a  56  it shows how the opponents of islam disregarded their responsibility and violated their agreements . the use of the words every time shows clearly that the muslims never hesitated in making a new agreement when one was violated  but the disbelievers did not even then respect their agreements  hence  as a last resort  muslims were allowed to repudiate unrespected agreements  v. 58  . b  57  that is  an exemplary punishment should be inflicted on them  so that a stop might be put to further fighting and bloodshed . c  58  if the other party does not remain faithful to the agreement of peace  muslims may also repudiate it . the word fear does not indicate that a mere appre hension  unsupported by any action on the other side s part  is sufficient for repudiation . read it along with v. 62  and the meaning is clear . d  60  muslims had won a victory at badr  though they were not even well equipped and had made no preparation for the war . but they are told that they must in future keep themselves well prepared and avail themselves of all sources of strength  so that the enemy should by their very preparedness assume a peace ful attitude . it was evident that the weakness of the muslims was a temptation for their opponents to attack them . 228 8 . voluntary gifts â€¢ 8  61 61 and if they incline to peace  you  must  incline to it also  and trust in allah . surely he is the hearer  the knower . 62 and if they intend to deceive you  then surely allah is sufficient for you .  he it is who strengthened you with his help and with the belie vers  63 and he has united their hearts . if you had spent all that is in the earth  you could not have united their hearts  but allah united them . surely he is mighty  wise . 64 prophet  allah is sufficient for you and those who follow you from the believers . section 9  muslims to meet overwhelming numbers 65 o prophet  urge the believers to fight . if there are of you twenty steadfast  they shall overcome two hundred  and if there are of you a hundred  they shall overcome a thousand of those who disbelieve  because they are a people who do not understand 66 now allah has lightened your burden and he knows that there is weakness in you . so if there are of you a hundred steadfast  they shall overcome two hundred  and if there are of you a thousand  they shall overcome two thousand by allah s permission . and allah is with the steadfast . a  62  the deceit is in relation to what has been said in the previous verse  the meaning being that   they intend to deceive you under the cloak of peace  even in such a case peace is to be accepted . b  651  it should be noted that the war to which muslims were to be urged was the defensive war which they had to fight to save themselves and to protect the religion of islam . the sword had been taken up against them  see 2190  2217  2239  etc . c  652  there is a clear prophecy here that  despite their fewer numbers  muslims shall be victorious . after the battle of badr came the battle of uhud  in which muslims were less than 1 to 4 against the enemy  this was followed by the battle of the ahzab  in which they were 1 to 10  yet the enemy was routed . d  66  the statements in verses 65 and 66 relate to two different states of the muslims . at the time of the battle of badr there was no muslim army in exis tence . they had very few arms  and they had never been trained . this is referred to in the words  he knows that there is weakness in you . so the muslim forces as then constituted could at most be a match for double their numbers . but a time did come when they were a match for ten times their numbers . so both the

the frail goods of this world  while allah desires  for you  the hereafter .  and allah is mighty  wise . 68 if an ordinance from allah had not gone before  surely a great punishment would have

relations of muslim state with others 70 o prophet  say to those of the captives who are in your hands  if allah knows anything good in your hearts  he will give you better than what has been taken from you  and will forgive you . and allah is forgiving  merciful . 71 and if they intend to be treacherous to you  so indeed they have been treacherous to allah before  but he gave  you  mastery over them . and allah is know ing  wise . 72 surely those who believed and fled  their homes  and struggled hard in allah s way with their wealth and their lives  and those who gave shelter and helped â€ ” these are friends of a  67  the commentators are of opinion that this verse and the next refer to releasing the prisoners of war taken at badr after taking ransom from them  which act  it is said  is here disapproved . but various considerations show that these verses refer to some other incidents . the reference is to the desire â€ ” not to an action already completed â€ ” of a party of the muslims referred to in v. 7  and you loved that the one not armed should be yours . some muslims desired to attack and capture the unarmed caravan  but depredations like these  though committed by disbelievers upon muslims  were not fit for a prophet . he must fight a hard fight in his defence first and then  if he overcomes the enemy  he may take pri soners . thus this injunction also declares slavery to be illegal  and allows only the retaining of those who are taken prisoners in war . the frail goods of this world appropriately refer to the caravan and its merchandise  while the addition of the concluding words in v. 69  eat then of the lawful and good things which you have acquired in war  shows that the ransom received on account of the prisoners is among the lawful and good things . b  68  that ordinance from allah was to bring about an encounter with the main army of the quraish at badr . it is referred to in v. 7 and v. 42 . 230 8 . voluntary gifts â€¢ 8  73 one another . and those who believed and did not flee  you are not responsible for their protection until they flee . and if they seek help from you in the matter of religion  it is your duty to help  them  except against a people between whom and you there is a treaty .  and allah is seer of what you do . 73 and those who disbelieve are friends of one another . if you do not do it  there will be persecu tion in the land and great mischief . 74 and those who believed and fled and struggled hard in allah s way  and those who gave shelter and helped â€ ” these are the believers truly . for them is forgiveness and an honourable provision . 75 and those who believed afterwards and fled and struggled hard along with you  they are of you . and the relatives are nearer to one another in the ordinance of allah . c surely allah is knower of all things . a  72  those who believed  and  having been persecuted  fled from their homes  i.e . the muhajirin  formed a community at madinah along with those who gave them shelter and helped them  i.e . the ansar . but there were those who chose to remain in their homes . the muslim community at madinah could not undertake to guard the interests of such persons  and this is what is meant by saying  you are not responsible for their protection . but if they seek help in the matter of religion  it is incumbent on the muslim community to give them help  unless there exists a treaty of alliance with the people against whom such help is sought . b  73  if you do not help your brethren in the matter of religion  the dis believers will become more daring in their persecutions and in causing mischief and disorder in the land . c  75  when even strangers who have accepted islam and fled from their homes become  of you   those who have in addition ties of relationship  possess every title to have their interests guarded by the muslim community . chapter 9 aibaraat immunity the name of this chapter  which is also called a ltaubah or repentance  refers to the declaration in its opening verses that muslims were now not subject to their agreements with certain idolatrous arab tribes who had been constantly breaking them  verses 713  . the chapter thus first deals with the subject of agreements with them as depending on their adherence to them  and goes on to prophesy the triumph of islam in arabia and later in the world . it then refers to the expedition to tabuk by muslims undertaken at great sacrifice  and deals with the subject of those who excused themselves and the hypocrites . at the end  muslims are reminded of the importance of the propagation of islam and contributing towards it  which was the real object of islam . this chapter was revealed in 9 a.h . this is the only chapter of the quran not opening with bismillah   in the name of allah  the beneficent  the merciful   as it is  in a sense  a continuation of the last chapter . section 1  declaration of immunity 1 a declaration of immunity from allah and his messenger to those of the idolaters with whom you made an agreement .  2 so go about in the land for four months and know that you can not escape allah and that allah will disgrace the disbelievers . 3 and an announcement from allah and his messenger to the people on the day of the greater pilgrimage that allah is free from liability to the idolaters  and so is his messenger . so if you repent  it will be a  1  this is a declaration of immunity from obligations with such of the idolatrous tribes of arabia as had repeatedly broken their agreements with the muslims . they broke their agreements again and again  856   yet the muslims were enjoined to accept peace if the disbelievers consented to it  even after repea ted violations  861  . but this state of things could not continue long  for it was soon found that it was impossible to trust such neighbours . this repudiation of agreements took place on a large scale when the muslims were absent on the tabuk expedition . b  3  the first thirteen verses of this chapter were publicly proclaimed by ali on the occasion of the pilgrimage in 9 a.h. 231 232 9 . the immunity â€¢ 9  4 better for you  and if you turn away  then know that you will not escape allah . and announce painful punishment to those who disbelieve â€ ” 4 except those of the idolaters with whom you made an agreement  then they have not failed you in anything and have not backed up anyone against you  so fulfil their agreement to the end of their term . surely allah loves those who keep their duty .  5 so when the sacred months have passed  kill the idolaters  wherever you find them  and take them captive and besiege them and lie in wait for them in every ambush .  but if they repent and keep up prayer and give the due charity  leave their way free . c surely allah is forgiving  merciful . 6 and if anyone of the idola ters seek your protection  protect him till he hears the word of allah  then convey him to his place of safety . this is because they are a people who do not know. a  4  the exception given here makes it clear that the muslims were not fighting with the idolaters on account of their religion  but on account of their having been untrue to their agreements . b  51  the clear exception of the last verse shows that by the idolaters here are meant  not all idolaters or polytheists wherever they may be found in the world  not even all idolaters of arabia  but only those idolatrous tribes of arabia assem bled at the pilgrimage who had first made agreements with the muslims and then violated them . the order to kill them and to make them prisoners and to besiege them and ambush them amounts clearly to an order to fight against them  as it is in war only that all these actions are made lawful .  editor s note  the expression  kill them wherever you find them  has also been used in 2190191  where it is also declared clearly   and fight in the way of allah against those who fight against you but do not be aggressive  . thus  wherever you find them  means wherever you find those who are engaged in fighting against you  after they have been the first to attack you .  c  52  the whole verse relates to certain idolatrous arab tribes who had broken their engagements with the muslims  and who had now been apprised of a similar repudiation by the muslims . they had so often broken their word that they could no more be trusted . yet  if they joined the brotherhood of islam  and there was an absolute change in their condition  the punishment which they otherwise deserved could be remitted . it was a case of forgiving a guilty people who had repented . nothing could be further from the truth than the allegation that this offers to the disbelievers the alternative of either being killed or accepting islam . d  6  this verse leaves no doubt that the holy prophet was never ordered by god to kill anyone on account of his religion . any idolater seeking the protection 97 reasons for the immunity 233 section 2  reasons for the immunity 7 how can there be an agreement for the idolaters with allah and with his messenger  except those with whom you made an agreement at the sacred mosque  so as long as they are true to you  be true to them . surely allah loves those who keep their duty . a 8 how  can it be   and if they prevail against you  they respect neither ties of relationship nor covenant in your case . they would please you with their mouths while their hearts refuse  and most of them are transgressors . 9 they have taken a small price for the messages of allah  so they hinder  people  from his way . surely evil is what they do . 10 they respect neither ties of relationship nor covenant in the case of a believer . and these are they who go beyond the limits . n but if they repent and keep up prayer and give the due charity  they are your brethren in faith . and we make the messages clear for a people who know . 12 and if they break their oaths after their agreement and revile your religion  then fight the leaders of disbelief â€ ” surely their oaths are nothing â€ ” so that they may ceased 13 will you not fight a people who broke their oaths and aimed at the expulsion of the messenger  and they attacked you first  do you fear them  but allah has more right that you should fear him  if you are believers . 14 fight them  allah will punish of the muslims in order to learn about islam was to be granted safe conduct to return home in case he did not think it fit to embrace islam . a  7  so long as the idolaters were true to their agreements  muslims were required to be true to them . just as in the case of war  muslims were not allowed to fight until the enemy had first attacked  so  in the case of repudiation of agree ments  it was the enemy who first repudiated the agreement . b  10  note the repeated assertions of the quran that the disbelievers were not to be fought against for their disbelief but for their being first in starting war or repudiating agreements . c  12  those leaders of disbelief are to be fought against who break their oaths after their agreements . d  13  editor s note  this again makes clear that muslims are only required to fight those who attacked them first . 234 9 . the immunity â€¢ 9  15 them at your hands and bring them to disgrace  and assist you against them and relieve the hearts of a believing people  15 and remove the rage of their hearts . and allah turns  mercifully  to whom he pleases . and allah is knowing  wise . 16 do you think that you would be left alone while allah has not yet known those of you who struggle hard and do not take anyone as an intimate friend besides allah and his messenger and the believers  and allah is aware of what you do . section 3  idolaters  service of the sacred house 17 the idolaters have no right to maintain the mosques of allah  while bearing witness to disbelief against themselves . these it is whose deeds are fruitless  and in the fire will they abide . 18 only he can maintain the mosques of allah who believes in allah and the last day  and keeps up prayer and gives the due charity and fears none but allah . so these it is who may be of the guided ones . 19 do you hold the giving of drink to the pilgrims and the maintenance of the sacred mosque equal to  the service of  one who believes in allah and the last day and strives hard in allah s way  they are not equal in the sight of allah . and allah does not guide the wrongdoing people . 20 those who believed and fled  their homes   and strove hard in allah s way with their wealth and their lives  are much higher in rank with allah . and it is these that shall triumph . 21 their lord gives them good news of mercy and pleasure  from himself  and gardens in which lasting blessings will be theirs  22 abiding in them forever . surely allah has a mighty reward with him . 23 o you who believe  do not take your fathers and your brothers for friends if they love disbelief above faith . and who a  17  by the mosques of allah is meant particularly the sacred mosque at makkah  as being the centre of all the mosques of the world . this is made clear in v. 19 . it had long remained in the hands of the idolaters  who visited and repaired it  having placed a large number of idols within it . with the conquest of makkah the sacred mosque was denuded of all idols  and was now as pure an emblem of monotheism as in the time of abraham . hence the idolworshippers had nothing to do with it now . 9  24 â€¢ islam made triumphant in arabia 235 ever of you takes them for friends  such are the wrongdoers . 24 say  if your fathers and your sons and your brethren and your wives and your kinsfolk and the wealth you have acquired  and trade whose dullness you fear  and dwellings you love  are dearer to you than allah and his messenger and striving in his way  then wait till allah brings his command to pass . and allah does not guide the transgressing people .  section 4  islam made triumphant in arabia 25 certainly allah helped you in many battlefields  and on the day of hunain  when your great numbers made you proud  but they availed you nothing  and the earth with all its vastness was narrowed for you  then you turned back retreating . 26 then allah sent down his calm upon his messenger and upon the believers  and sent armies which you did not see  and punished those who disbelieved . and such is the reward of the disbelievers . 27 then will allah  after this  turn mercifully to whom he pleases . and allah is forgiving  merciful . 28 o you who believe  the idolaters are surely unclean  c so a  24  a true muslim may have wealth  may carry on trade  may have mag nificent houses  but these should not be dearer to him than allah and exertion in his path . he should be ready to sacrifice all these interests for a higher purpose  before which all these sink into insignificance . the quran does not require one actually to hate riches  but rather not to be obsessed by wealth to the neglect of one s higher duties . the acquisition of wealth is not harmful so long as it is not made the real aim of life  but has its proper place as the means to an end . b  25  the battle of hunain  fought in 8 a.h. in the valley of hunain  about three miles from makkah  differed from the other battles in that the muslims here outnumbered the enemy . however  the archers of the enemy were good marks men  and had occupied strong positions in the mountain passes . the muslim army contained some men from makkah still adhering to idolatry . unfortunately this was the advance party of the army  and  unable to face the archers  they retreated causing disorder to the whole army . the holy prophet  however  led the assault  at first alone  in face of the archers  but was soon joined by others and a victory was obtained  as the next verse shows . c  281  because they indulged in evil practices and went naked round the kabah . compare 590  where idols are declared to be unclean . 236 9 . the immunity â€¢ 9  29 they shall not approach the sacred mosque after this year of theirs .  and if you fear poverty  then allah will enrich you out of his grace  if he please . surely allah is knowing  wise . 29 fight those who do not believe in allah  nor in the last day  nor forbid what allah and his messenger have forbidden  nor follow the religion of truth  out of those who have been given the book  until they pay the tax in acknowledgement of superiority and they are in a state of subjection a  282  the year of the proclamation  i.e . 9 a.h. b  283  the importance of makkah as a commercial centre lay in the fact that the whole of arabia repaired to it in the season of the pilgrimage  and there carried out important commercial transactions . the prohibition referred to in the first part of the verse could have been easily foreseen as affecting the commerce  and consequently the prosperity of makkah  but worldly or business considera tions never interfered with the carrying out of the moral reforms of islam . c  29  the great christian power  the roman empire  had just mobilized its forces for the subjection of the new religion  and the tabflk expedition took place  which is dealt with further on in this chapter . as the object of this christian power was simply the subjection of the muslims  their final defeat by the muslims is spoken of as subjection . it was not in any way the object of the quran to bring the christians into subjection . on the other hand  the christians first moved them selves to bring muslim arabia under subjection . tbsjizyah or tax spoken of here is  according to lane s lexicon  the tax that is taken from the free nonmuslim subjects of the muslim government whereby they ratify the compact that ensures them protection . the permission to fight given to muslims is subject to the condition that the enemy should first take up the sword  2190  . the holy prophet never over stepped this limit  nor did his followers . he fought against the arabs when they took up the sword to destroy the muslims  and he led an expedition against the christians when the roman empire first mobilized its forces with the object of subjugating the muslims . when he found that the enemy had not yet taken the ini tiative  he did not attack the roman empire  but returned without fighting . later on  however  the roman empire  like the persians  fomented trouble against the newly established muslim kingdom  as a result of which both these empires came into conflict with the muslims and  despite the fact that both the persians and the romans were very powerful nations with unlimited resources and strong military organizations  and that they both tried at the same time to subjugate islam  the result was what is predicted here in clear words â€ ” they were both reduced to a state of subjection by an insignificant nation like the arabs . 9  30 â€¢ islam will triumph in the world 237 section 5  islam will triumph in the world 30 and the jews say  ezra is the son of allah  a and the chris tians say  the messiah is the son of allah . these are the words of their mouths . they imitate the saying of those who disbelieved before . allah s curse be on them  how they are turned away  from truth   31 they take their doctors of law and their monks for lords besides allah and  also  the messiah  son of mary . and they were enjoined that they should serve one god only â€ ” there is no god but he . glory be to him from what they set up as partners  with him   32 they desire to put out the light of allah with their mouths  but allah will allow nothing except the perfection of his light  though the disbelievers are averse 33 he it is who has sent his messenger with the guidance and the religion of truth that he may make it prevail over all religions  though those who set up partners  with allah  are averse . e a  301  it has been shown by muslim historians that there was a sect among the jews who raised ezra to the dignity of godhead or son of god . the quran never blames the jewish nation as a whole for entertaining this belief . however  the word son in case of ezra may have been used here freely as meaning a special favourite  in the same way as elsewhere the quran says of the jews and the chris tians that they call themselves the sons of allah and his beloved ones  518  . b  302  we are here told that the christian doctrine that jesus christ was the son of god was borrowed from earlier pagan people . recent research has estab lished the fact beyond all doubt . in fact  when st. paul saw that the jews would on no account accept jesus christ as a messenger of god  he introduced the pagan doctrine of sonship of god into the christian religion  so that it might become more acceptable to the pagans . c  31  this does not mean that they took them actually for gods  the meaning is that they followed them blindly in what they enjoined and what they forbade  attaching to them a divine dignity . muslims who accord a similar position to their ulama  spiritual leaders or saints are guilty of the same error . d  32  this is a prophecy of the ultimate triumph of islam in face of severe opposition . all opposition to truth  whether based on force or propaganda  is here compared with putting out the divine light by blowing with the mouth to show that all such attempts would prove futile . the divine light will be made perfect  by which is meant the triumph of islam  as the next verse states clearly . e  33  the prophecy of the ultimate triumph of islam in the whole world is 238 9 . the immunity â€¢ 9  34 34 o you who believe  surely many of the doctors of law and monks eat away people s property falsely  and hinder  them  from allah s way . and those who hoard up gold and silver and do not spend it in allah s way â€ ” announce to them a painful punishment  3s on the day when it will be heated in the fire of hell  then their foreheads and their sides and their backs will be branded with it  this is what you hoarded up for yourselves  so taste what you used to hoard .  36 surely the number of months with allah is twelve months by allah s ordinance  since the day when he created the heavens and the earth â€ ” of these four are sacred . that is the right religion  so do not wrong yourselves in regard to them . and fight the idolaters all together as they fight you all together. and know that allah is with those who keep their duty . 37 postponing  of the sacred month  is only an addition in disbelief  by which those who disbelieve are led astray . they allow it one year and forbid it  another  year  that they may agree in the number  of months  repeated three times in the quran  in exactly the same words â€ ” here and in 4828 and 619 . in arabia itself  islam became triumphant in the lifetime of the holy prophet . after his death  the first century of the muslim era saw vast christian communities swelling the ranks of islam  in egypt  north africa  asia minor  persia and central asia . more amazing was the fact that islam  coming in contact with other great religions  with zoroastrianism in persia  with buddhism and hinduism in india and afghanistan  and with confucianism in china  conquered the hearts of the followers of every religion and they accepted the message of truth in vast numbers . and the final manifestation of this great prophecy is fore shadowed in the gradual acceptance of the principles of islam in the whole world today  despite the fact that the political power of islam is at its lowest ebb . a  35  the punishment of an evil is spoken of throughout the quran as simi lar to the evil . even in this world  a man feels a torment similar to the nature of the evil in which he indulges . being branded with the hoarded wealth is thus a fit description of the punishment of the hoarders . b  361  the allusion here is to the arab practice of postponing the pilgri mage to a month other than that in which it fell  for which see the next verse . c  362  fighting was prohibited in the sacred months  2217  . excepting this  the muslims were told to fight with the idolaters as the idolaters fought with them  i.e . since all idolaters united in fighting with the muslims  the latter  too  should unite in fighting with them . 938  the tabuk expedition 239 which allah has made sacred  and thus make lawful what allah has forbidden .  the evil of their doings is made to seem good to them . and allah does not guide the disbelieving people . section 6  the tabuk expedition 38 o you who believe  what  excuse  have you that when it is said to you  go forth in allah s way  you should incline heavily to earth  are you contented with this world s life instead of the hereafter  the provision of this world s life is but little as com pared with the hereafter . 39 if you do not go forth  he will punish you with a painful punishment  and bring in your place a people other than you  and you can do him no harm . c and allah is power ful over all things . 40 if you do not help him  allah certainly helped him when those who disbelieved expelled him â€ ” he being the second of the two  when they were both in the cave  when he said to his com panion  do not grieve  surely allah is with us . so allah sent a  37  the reference here is to the practice of postponing observance of the sacred month  thus allowing an ordinary month to be observed as sacred and a sacred month to be treated as ordinary . this practice interfered with the security of life which was guaranteed in the sacred months  and is  therefore  denounced . b  38  this refers to the expedition of tabuk  which was undertaken in the middle of 9 a.h. owing to the threatening attitude of the roman empire . there were many hindrances to the raising of an army sufficient to meet the strong forces of the roman empire  the main ones being  a great drought  the length of the journey to syria  the ripening of the fruits which were now ready to be gathered  the heat  and the organization and power of the roman army . in spite of all these difficulties 30000 men gathered round the holy prophet s banner . c  39  the reference here and in what follows is to certain men  who  while professing belief  hesitated to accept the holy prophet s call to get ready for the expedition . rf  40  this refers to the holy prophet s flight from makkah  when he was forced to hide himself in a cave called thaur  about three miles from makkah  with only one companion  abu bakr   the second of the two  . the believers are told that allah saved the prophet from the hands of his enemies when he had just one companion amidst a whole nation of enemies  and that allah would help him now . 240 9 . the immunity â€¢ 9  41 down his tranquillity on him and strengthened him with forces which you did not see  and made lowest the word of those who disbelieved . and the word of allah  that is the uppermost . and allah is mighty  wise . 41 go forth  light and heavy   and strive hard in allah s way with your wealth and your lives . this is better for you  if you know . 42 if it had been a near gain and a short journey  they would cer tainly have followed you  but the hard journey was too long for them . and they will swear by allah  if we had been able  we would have gone forth with you . they cause their own souls to perish  and allah knows that they are liars . section 7  the hypocrites 43 allah pardon youf why did you permit them until those who spoke the truth had become apparent to you and you had known the liars  44 those who believe in allah and the last day do not ask permission from you  to stay away  from striving hard with their wealth and their persons . and allah is knower of those who keep their duty . 45 they alone ask permission from you who do not believe in allah and the last day  and their hearts are in doubt  so in their doubt they waver . 46 and if they had intended to go forth  they would certainly have provided equipment for it  but allah did not like their going forth . so he withheld them  and it was said  hold back with those who hold back . 47 if they had gone a  41  that is  whether it is easy or difficult for you to proceed or whether you are sufficiently armed or not . b  42  tabuk was midway between madinah and damascus . the arabs were accustomed to fighting near home  hence  the distance was one of the chief consi derations which held back those who were insincere . c  43  this expression does not convey the significance of pardon of sins  it is rather the equivalent of allah bless you  or may allah set your affairs aright  in previous battles  too  the hypocrites always stayed away  offering one excuse or another . but the divine purpose in this last expedition of the holy prophet was to bring about a clear distinction  and to clean the muslim society of the hypocritical element thoroughly . such a distinction was really brought about later on as verses 8384 point out . 9  48 â€¢ the hypocrites 241 forth with you  they would have added to you nothing but trouble  and would have hurried to and fro among you seeking  to sow  dissension among you . and among you there are those who would listen to them . and allah well knows the wrongdoers . 48 certainly they sought  to sow  dissension before  and they devised plots against you till the truth came  and allah s command prevailed  though they did not like  it  . 49 and among them is he who says  excuse me and do not try me . surely into trial have they already fallen  and truly hell en compasses the disbelievers . 50 if good befalls you  it grieves them  and if hardship afflicts you  they say  indeed we had taken care of our affair before . and they turn away rejoicing . 51 say  nothing will afflict us except what allah has ordained for us . he is our patron  and on allah let the believers rely . 52 say  do you await for us but one of two most excellent things  a and we await for you that allah will afflict you with punishment from himself or by our hands . so wait  we too are waiting with you . 53 say  spend willingly or unwillingly  it will not be accepted from you . surely you are a transgressing people . 54 and nothing hinders their contributions being accepted from them  except that they disbelieve in allah and in his messenger and they do not come to prayer except as lazy people  nor do they spend  on good works  but reluctantly . 55 do not  then  let their wealth nor their children excite your admiration . allah only wishes to punish them by means of these in this world s life and  that  their souls may depart while they are disbelievers . c 56 and they swear by allah that a  521  the two most excellent things are  the laying down of life in the cause of truth  or being sharer in the ultimate triumph of truth . b  522  the only punishment that the hypocrites received from the hands of the muslims was that they were named and asked to leave the mosque . otherwise their liberty was not interfered with . see also the next verse . c  55  the hypocrites experienced earthly torture about their property and children for two reasons   1  because  avowing their belief in islam  they had to take some share in its defensive expeditions and thus spend part of their property  unwillingly though it was  in the cause of islam   2  the children of many of them were true believers  and they knew that after their death their property and their 242 9 . the immunity â€¢ 9  57 they are truly of you . and they are not of you  but they are a people who are afraid . 57 if they could find a refuge or caves or a place to enter  they would certainly have turned to it  running away in all haste . 58 and some of them blame you in the matter of the  distribu tion of  charity . so if they are given out of it  they are pleased  and if they are not given out of it  lo  they are enraged . 59 and  better it would be  if they were content with what allah and his messen ger gave them  and had said  allah is sufficient for us  allah will soon give us  more  out of his grace and his messenger too â€ ” surely to allah we make petition . section 8  the hypocrites 60  the due  charity a is only for the poor and the needy  and those employed to administer it  and those whose hearts are made to incline  to truth   and  to free  the captives  and those in debt  and in the way of allah and for the traveller â€ ” an ordinance from allah . and allah is knowing  wise . children were to become a source of strength to the very religion which they tried to extirpate . a  601  the word sadaqat  used here for charity  refers in this verse to the obligatory charity called zakat  and not to voluntary alms which is its common meaning . this is shown by the concluding words of the verse  which call it an ordinance from allah . b  602  the verse defines the objects for which the zakat or due charity may be spent . eight heads of expenditure are recognized . there are the poor  or those in difficult circumstances . then there are the needy  by which are meant people who need some help to enable them to earn their living  poor students and crafts men or business men without sufficient means are included in this category . thirdly  there are the collectors of zakat and other people employed to administer the funds . this shows that the institution was meant for raising a public fund  whose management should entirely be in the hands of a public body . in the fourth class are people whose hearts are made to incline to truth â€ ” carrying the message of truth to them needs funds  and there are also people who may need help if they accept the truth . the fifth head relates to the freeing of the prisoners of war . islam thus laid down a permanent basis for the abolition of slavery . the sixth class is that of debtors â€ ” people who incur debts for right purposes . squan derers of wealth are  however  not included in this category . the seventh head is 9  61 â€¢ the hypocrites 243 61 and some of them molest the prophet and say  he is  all  ear .  say  a hearer of good for you â€ ” he believes in allah and believes the faithful  and is a mercy for those of you who believe . and those who molest the messenger of allah  for them is a pain ful punishment . 62 they swear by allah to you to please you  and allah â€ ” as well as his messenger â€ ” has a greater right that they should please him  if they are believers . 63 do they not know that whoever opposes allah and his messenger  for him is the fire of hell to abide in it  that is the grievous disgrace . 64 the hypocrites fear that a chapter may be sent down con cerning them  telling them plainly of what is in their hearts . say  go on mocking  surely allah will bring to light what you fear . 65 and if you ask them  they would certainly say  we were only talking idly and sporting . say  was it allah and his messages and his messenger that you mocked  66 make no excuse  you dis believed after your believing . if we pardon some of you  we shall punish others because they are guilty . c section 9  the hypocrites 67 the hypocrites  men and women  are all alike . they enjoin evil and forbid good and withhold their hands . they have forsaken allah  so he has forsaken them . surely the hypocrites are the transgressors . 68 auah promises the hypocrites  men and women  and the disbelievers the fire of hell to abide in it . it is enough in general words  in the way of allah  . this would include those fighting in defence of faith and the community  or those engaged in propagating islamic truths  but the words may be taken generally and include every charitable purpose . the eighth head is that of travellers  people who are stranded in a country  to what ever religion or nation they may belong . a  61  the hypocrites made various derogatory remarks concerning the holy prophet  saying among other things  that he was a man who believed everything that he heard  and they were therefore sure that they would make him believe their hypocritical professions . b  62  though allah and his messenger are both mentioned together  the duty of the faithful is here said to be to please him  i.e . allah alone . c  66  history shows that most of the hypocrites ultimately repented and sincerely joined the ranks of the faithful . 244 9 . the immunity â€¢ 9  69 for them . and allah curses them  and for them is a lasting punish ment . 69 like those before you â€ ” they were stronger than you in power and had more wealth and children . so they enjoyed their portion  thus have you enjoyed your portion as those before you enjoyed their portion  and you indulge in idle talk as they did . these are they whose deeds are fruitless in this world and the here after  and these are they who are the losers . 70 has not the story reached them of those before them â€ ” of the people of noah and ad and thamud  and the people of abraham and the dwellers of midian and the overthrown cities  their messengers came to them with clear arguments . so allah did not wrong them but they wronged themselves . 71 and the believers  men and women  are friends of one another . they enjoin good and forbid evil and keep up prayer and give the due charity  and obey allah and his messenger . as for these  allah will have mercy on them . surely allah is mighty  wise . 72 allah has promised to the believers  men and women  gardens  in which rivers flow  to abide in them  and goodly dwell ings in gardens of perpetual abode . and greatest of all is allah s goodly pleasure . that is the mighty achievement . section 10  the hypocrites 73 o prophet  strive hard against the disbelievers and the hypocrites and be firm against them .  and their abode is hell  and evil is the destination . 74 they swear by allah that they said nothing . and certainly they did speak the word of disbelief  and dis believed after their islam  and they aimed  to do  what they could a  73  jihad signifies striving hard . it is in a secondary sense that the word signifies fighting  and it is repeatedly used in the quran in its primary signifi cance . it is a fact that those who professed islam insincerely were never fought against by the muslims â€ ” as on this occasion and on the occasion of the battle of uhud . the holy prophet is commanded here to carry on a jihad against dis believers as well as hypocrites . hence the only significance that can be attached to these words is that he must continue to exert himself hard in preaching both to the disbelievers and the hypocrites . 9  75 â€¢ the hypocrites 245 not attain . and they sought revenge only because allah â€ ” as well as his messenger â€ ” had enriched them out of his grace . so if they repent  it will be good for them  and if they turn away  allah will punish them with a painful punishment in this world and the hereafter  and they shall have in the earth neither a friend nor a helper . 75 and some of them made a covenant with allah  if he give us out of his grace  we will certainly give in charity and be of the righteous . 76 but when he gave them out of his grace  they became miserly with it and they turned away and they are averse . 77 so he repaid them with hypocrisy in their hearts till the day when they meet him  because they broke their promise with allah and because they lied . 78 do they not know that allah knows their hidden thoughts and their secret counsels  and that allah is the great knower of the unseen things  79 those who taunt the free givers of charity among the believers as well as those who can not find anything  to give  but with their hard labour â€ ” they scoff at them . allah will pay them back their mockery  and for them is a painful punishment 80 ask forgiveness for them or do not ask forgiveness for them . even if you ask forgiveness for them seventy times  allah will not forgive them . this is because they disbelieve in allah and his messenger . and allah does not guide the transgressing people . a  741  they did their best to put an end to the life of the holy prophet and bring about the extirpation of islam . b  742  the advent of the muslims in madinah had enriched its inhabitants . was it not  then  a matter for wonder that those men who had gained by islam should turn against their very benefactors  c  79  when subscriptions were raised for the expedition to tabuk  the wealthier members of the muslim community gave large donations  while the poorer ones  the labourers  also paid their mite out of their hard earnings . the hypocrites taunted both  the former as making a show of their wealth  the latter as bringing in their small subscriptions only to be counted among the subscribers . d  80  spiritual relations with the hypocrites were henceforth cut off . the mention of seventy may not indicate the specific number here . when abdullah ibn ubayy  the recognized leader of the hypocrites  died  the holy prophet was asked 246 9 . the immunity â€¢ 9  81 section 1 1  the hypocrites 81 those who were left behind were glad on account of their remaining behind allah s messenger  and they disliked to strive in allah s way with their property and their persons  and said  do not go forth in the heat . say  the fire of hell is fiercer in heat . if only they could understand  82 then let them laugh a little and weep much â€ ” a recompense for what they earned . 83 so if allah bring you back to some of them  then they ask your permission to go forth  say  never shall you go forth with me and never shall you fight an enemy with me . you chose to sit  at home  the first time  so sit  now  with those who remain behind .  84 and never offer prayer for anyone of them who dies  nor stand by his grave . surely they disbelieved in allah and his messenger and they died in transgression . 85 and do not let their to conduct the burial service . the holy prophet got up  but umar objected on the ground that abdullah was a hypocrite  and referred to his hostile attitude through out his life . the holy prophet replied that allah had given him a choice  referring to the words of this verse  ask forgiveness for them or do not ask forgiveness for them   and that he would ask forgiveness for him for over seventy times  so that forgiveness could be extended to the dead man . then he offered prayers for him . verse 84 is said to have been revealed then to stop the offering of prayers for those who were known to be hypocrites  bukhari  2384  . the incident shows how kind and forgiving the holy prophet was to his severest enemies . abdullah ibn ubayy was the man who had led the hypocrite movement against him  and thus was not only one of his worst enemies  but a most dangerous one  because he was aware of all the movements of the muslims and deceived them at the most critical moments . yet the holy prophet forgave him entirely . a  83  this is the only punishment given to the hypocrites  namely  that they were not allowed to take part in future expeditions against the enemies of the muslims . it is also related that from one of them the holy prophet and the three caliphs who followed him refused to accept the zakat . these were the only dis advantages  if it is right to call them so  which the hypocrites suffered . they were not looked upon as members of the muslim community  but as citizens they enjoyed all the rights of other citizens . b  84  the prophet is now told that  though they professed islam outwardly  they were disbelievers at heart  and the burial service  which was only for mus lims  should not be extended to them . but it was through divine revelation that the prophet learnt that they were really disbelievers . it is  further  clear from these 9  86 â€¢ the hypocrites 247 wealth and their children excite jour admiration . allah only intends to punish them thereby in this world  and  that  their souls may depart while they are disbelievers . 86 and when a chapter is revealed  saying  believe in allah and strive hard along with his messenger  the wealthy among them ask permission of you and say  leave us  behind   that we may be with those who sit  at home  . 87 they prefer to be with those who remain behind  and their hearts are sealed so they do not under stand . 88 but the messenger and those who believe with him strive hard with their property and their persons . and these it is for whom are the good things and these it is who are successful . 89 allah has prepared for them gardens in which rivers flow  to abide therein . that is the mighty achievement . section 12  the hypocrites 90 and the defaulters from among the dwellers of the desert came that permission might be given to them  and they sat  at home  who lied to allah and his messenger . a painful punish ment will afflict those of them who disbelieve . 91 no blame lies on the weak  nor on the sick  nor on those who can find nothing to spend  if they are sincere to allah and his messenger . there is no way  to blame  against the doers of good . and allah is forgiving  merciful â€ ” 92 nor on those to whom  when they came to you that you should carry them  you said  i can not find anything on which to carry you .  they went back  their eyes overflowing with tears of grief that they could not find anything to spend . 93 the way  to blame  is only against those who ask permission of you  though they are rich . they have chosen to be with those who remained behind  and allah has sealed their hearts  so they do not know . words that those who were known to be hypocrites were not fought against but lived to die a natural death . there is not a single case on record of any one of them having been put to death . standing by the grave refers to the holy prophet s practice of praying for the deceased standing by his grave after the burial . a  92  what they wanted in order to join the expedition  and what the holy prophet could not find for them  were beasts on which they should be carried  along with their provisions and necessaries . see also 1927 footnote 1 . 0 248 9 . the immunity â€¢ 9  94 94 they will make excuses to you when you return to them . say  make no excuse  we shall not believe you  allah has informed us of matters relating to you . and allah and his messenger will now see your actions  then you will be brought back to the knower of the unseen and the seen  then he will inform you of what you did .  95 they will swear by allah to you  when you return to them  so that you may leave them alone . so leave them alone . surely they are unclean and their refuge is hell â€ ” a recompense for what they earned . 96 they will swear to you that you may be pleased with them . but if you are pleased with them  yet surely allah is not pleased with the transgressing people . 97 the dwellers of the desert are hardest in disbelief and hypo crisy  and most disposed not to know the limits of what allah has revealed to his messenger . and allah is knowing  wise . 98 and some of the dwellers of the desert take what they spend to be a fine  e and they wait for an evil turn of fortune for you . on them is the evil turn . and allah is hearing  knowing .  and some of the dwellers of the desert believe in allah and the last day  and consider what they spend and the prayers of the messenger as bringing them nearer to allah . surely they bring them nearer  to allah   allah will admit them into his mercy . surely allah is forgiving  merciful . section 13  the hypocrites 100 and the foremost  the first of the emigrants and the help ers  and those who followed them in goodness â€ ” allah is well a  94  evidently these verses were revealed when the holy prophet was away from madinah  and the statements made in them are therefore prophetical  being exactly fulfilled on his return . b  95  on his return from tabflk  the holy prophet forbade muslims to have any relations with the hypocrites . c  98  the hypocrites had to contribute something for the sake of appear ance  they also paid the zakat so that they might be treated as muslims . d  100  in the history of islam  the word emigrants   muhajirin  came to signify all those companions of the holy prophet who  having embraced islam at 9101  the hypocrites 249 pleased with them and they are well pleased with him  and he has prepared for them gardens in which rivers flow  abiding therein forever . that is the mighty achievement . 101 and some of the dwellers of the desert around you are hypocrites  and some of the people of madinah  also  â€ ” they persist in hypocrisy . fou do not know them  we know them . a we will punish them twice  then they will be turned back to a severe punishment . 102 and others have acknowledged their faults â€ ” they mixed a good deed with another that was evil . it may be that allah will turn to them  mercifully  . surely allah is forgiving  merciful . e 103 take charity out of their property â€ ” you would cleanse them and purify them thereby â€ ” and pray for them . surely your prayer is a relief to them . and allah is hearing  knowing 104 do they not know that allah is he who accepts repentance from his servants and takes the charity  and that allah â€ ” he is the oft returning  to mercy   the merciful  105 and say  work  so allah will see your work and  so will  his messenger and the believers . and you will be brought back to the knower of the unseen and the seen  then he will inform you of what you did . 106 and others are makkah  had to flee from their homes either to abyssinia  present day ethiopia  or to madinah . the latter flight  including nearly all the muslims of makkah  is known as the hijra or flight  and the muslim era dates from it . the word helpers   ansar  signifies the muslims of madinah who  having accepted islam before the flight  gave shelter to those who fled from makkah . by  those who followed them in goodness  are meant the muslims who came after the com panions and followed their good deeds . a  1011  the insincerity of the heart could not be known to a mortal â€ ” it is known only to allah . b  1012  the hypocrites were punished twice in this life . they had to take part in all contributions for the defence of the muslim community and had to pay the zakat  all this against their conviction and unwillingly . after having suffered all this torment for the sake of being reckoned muslims  they were ultimately separated from the muslims  and this exposure to public shame was no doubt a great punishment for them . c  102  according to different reports  the number of these men varied from three to ten . they were sincere and acknowledged their fault . d  103  because they showed sincerity in confessing their faults  they were dealt with leniently . their charity was not to be rejected . 250 9 . the immunity â€¢ 9  107 made to await allah s command  whether he will punish them or turn to them  mercifully  . and allah is knowing  wise .  107 and those who built a mosque to cause harm  to islam  and  to help  disbelief  and to cause disunion among the believers  and a refuge for him who made war against allah and his messen ger before . and they will certainly swear  we desired nothing but good . and allah bears witness that they are certainly liars . 108 never stand in it . certainly a mosque founded on observance of duty from the first day is more deserving that you should stand in it . in it are men who love to purify themselves . and allah loves those who purify themselves 109 is he  then  who lays his foundation on duty to allah and  his  good pleasure better  or he who lays his founda tion on the edge of a cracking hollowed bank  so it broke down with him into the fire of hell  and allah does not guide the unjust people . 110 the building which they have built will ever continue to be a source of disquiet in their hearts  unless their hearts be torn to pieces . and allah is knowing  wise . section 14  the faithful 111 surely allah has bought from the believers their persons and their property â€ ” theirs  in return  is the garden . they fight in allah s way  so they kill and are killed . it is a promise which is a  106  this is generally supposed to refer to three of the believers who held back from the expedition  bukhari  6481  . b  107  some hypocrites built a mosque at the instigation of abu amir  with the object of causing harm to that mosque . abu amir  who after fighting against the holy prophet for a long time  had fled to syria after the battle of hunain  had written to his friends at madinah that he was coming with a formidable army to crush the prophet  and that they should build a mosque for him . but abu amir died in syria  and the founders desired the holy prophet to give it a blessing by his presence  which he was forbidden to do by divine revelation  and the mosque was demolished . c  108  the words are general and every mosque raised for the service of allah may be included in this description . rf  110  their hearts could be torn to pieces by severe regret or by sincere repentance . 9112  the faithful 25 1 binding on him in the torah and the gospel and the quran .  and who is more faithful to his promise than allah  rejoice therefore in your bargain which you have made . and that is the mighty achievement . 112 they who turn  to allah   who serve  him   who praise  him   who fast  who bow down  who prostrate themselves  who enjoin what is good and forbid what is evil  and who keep the limits of allah â€ ” and give good news to the believers . 113 it is not for the prophet and those who believe to ask for giveness for those who set up partners  with allah   even though they should be near relatives  after it has become clear to them that they are companions of the flaming fire . 114 and abraham s a  111  the promise binding on allah is that allah will grant the believers his blessings  if they exert themselves with their persons and their property in his way . the gospels give the same promise   if you want to be perfect   said jesus to a wealthy man   go  sell what you have and give to the poor  and you will have treasure in heaven  and come  follow me   matthew  1921  . to peter he said   everyone who has left houses or brothers or sisters or father or mother or wife or children or lands  for my name s sake  shall receive a hundredfold  and inherit eternal life   matthew  1929  . moses  teaching contains similar promises . for instance  the promise of  a land flowing with milk and honey  is made condi tional on  you shall love the lord your god with all your heart  with all your soul  and with all your strength   deuteronomy  635   which is the same as exerting oneself to the utmost in the way of god with one s person and property . it should be borne in mind that the words  they fight in allah s way  so they kill and are killed  are not a part of the promise  but are expressive of the condi tion of the companions  and show that they were true to their promise . the promise to spend one s person and property may be carried out in various ways under different circumstances  and the companions of the holy prophet were as true to this promise during the thirteen years at makkah as during the ten years at madinah . b  113  this verse does not prohibit praying for the forgiveness of the dis believers in general  but only such disbelievers about whom it became clear that they were doomed to the fire . when the holy prophet was asked to pray for the destruction of a people who were fighting against him  he prayed thus   my lord  forgive them because they do not know  . so long as a man is alive  however hard he may be in his disbelief  it is not forbidden to pray for his forgiveness or gui dance . but when he is dead  god will deal with him as he pleases  and he is the most merciful of all merciful ones . according to a hadith  after all intercessions have taken place  the most merciful of all will take a handful â€ ” and the handful with god is as vast as the heavens and the earth  3967  â€ ” out of hell and throw 252 9 . the immunity 9115 asking forgiveness for his sire was only owing to a promise which he had made to him  but when it became clear to him that he was an enemy of allah  he dissociated himself from him . surely abra ham was tenderhearted  forbearing . 115 and it is not  attributable to  allah that he should lead a people astray after he has guided them  so far so that he makes clear to them what they should guard against .  surely allah is knower of all things . 116 surely allah s is the kingdom of the heavens and the earth . he gives life and causes death . and besides allah you have no friend nor helper . 117 certainly allah has turned in mercy to the prophet and the emigrants and the helpers who followed him in the hour of hardship  after the hearts of a group of them were about to deviate  then he turned to them in mercy . surely to them he is com passionate  merciful  118 and  he turned in mercy  to the three who were left behind  until the earth  vast as it is  became narrow to them and their souls were also narrowed to them  and they knew that there was no refuge from allah but in him . then he turned to them in mercy that they might turn  to him  . surely allah â€ ” he is the oftreturning to mercy  the merciful them into the river of life  and these would be the people who never did any good  bukhari 9824  . but under this verse the burial service  which is a prayer for forgiveness  is held only for muslims  and not for those who die in disbelief . a  115  this verse establishes in clear words that allah never leads a people astray  and how could he lead astray  says the quran  when he it is who gives them guidance  and makes clear to them the evils they should guard against  b  117  taubah on the part of allah means his turning to his servant and changing one state to another which is higher than it . allah s turning mercifully is in relation to the prophet and those sincere believers who are plainly stated to have followed the prophet in the hour of difficulty . the group whose hearts were about to deviate is referred to in the next verse . c  118  these were three men from among the ansar  referred to in v. 106 . the words were left behind may mean left behind with respect to the command ment of allah concerning them  as v. 106 speaks of them as being  made to await allah s command  . they remained cut off from all relations with the muslims for fifty days . kab ibn malik  one of the three men  was a man of importance  and when he received a letter from the king of ghassan  offering him a position under him if he deserted the prophet  he burned the letter  showing his contempt for the offer  and gave no reply . 9119  the faithful 253 section 15  what the faithful should do 119 o you who believe  keep your duty to allah and be with the truthful . 120 it was not proper for the people of madinah and those round about them of the dwellers of the desert to remain behind the messenger of allah  nor to prefer their own lives to his life .  that is because neither thirst nor fatigue nor hunger afflicts them in allah s way  nor do they tread a path which enrages the disbelievers  nor do they cause any harm to an enemy  but a good work is written down for them on account of it . surely allah does not waste the reward of the doers of good  121 nor do they spend anything  small or great  nor do they traverse a valley but it is written down for them  that allah may reward them for the best of what they did . 122 and the believers should not go forth all together . why  then  does not a group from every party from among them go forth that they may apply themselves to obtain understanding in religion  and that they may warn their people when they come back to them  that they may be cautious  section 16  the prophet s great anxiety 123 o you who believe  fight those of the disbelievers who are near to you and let them find firmness in you . c and know that allah is with those who keep their duty . 124 and whenever a chapter is revealed  there are some of them who say  which of you has it strengthened in faith  so as for those who believe  it strengthens a  120  the meaning is that they should neither desire rest for themselves  nor comfort  nor protection  in preference to the prophet  in other words  they should accompany him in difficulty and distress . b  122  in the midst of the ordinances relating to fighting  the quran intro duces the subject of the preparation of a missionary force  thus showing that this was the greatest necessity of islam . it was only by means of a missionary effort that truth could be spread  and the ultimate object was not to be lost sight of  even when the community was engaged in a lifeanddeath struggle against over whelming forces of the enemy . c  123  because it was those who were near who persecuted the muslims . the object was to stop persecution . muslims must be firm and not yield to them . 254 9 . the immunity â€¢ 9  125 them in faith and they rejoice . 125 and as for those in whose hearts is a disease  it adds uncleanness to their uncleanness  and they die while they are disbelievers .  126 do they not see that they are tried once or twice in every year  yet they do not repent  nor do they become mindful . 127 and whenever a chapter is revealed  they look at one another  does anyone see you  then they turn away . allah has turned away their hearts because they are a people who do not understand . 128 certainly a messenger has come to you from among yourselves  very painful for him is your falling into distress  most concerned  he is  for you  to the believers  he is  compassionate  merciful . c 129 but if they turn away  say  allah is sufficient for me â€ ” there is no god but he . on him do i rely  and he is the lord of the mighty throne . a  125  the uncleanness of their hearts increased with new revelation  because it increased them in stubbornness  and their hearts were more and more hardened against truth . see also 716 footnote . b  126  these trials consisted of the expeditions which the muslims had to undertake every now and then  and in which the hypocrites were distinguished from the true believers . c  128  this is the true picture of the heart which grieved  not for his followers alone  not for one nation or country  but for all humanity . he grieves for the burdens of all  and he is most concerned for the welfare of all . the whole of humanity is meant here because the concluding words refer additionally to the believers . there is a special relation he bears to those who follow him  to them he is  in addition  compassionate and merciful . chapter 10 yunus jonah this chapter makes a brief reference to the prophet jonah  v. 98   which gives it its title  to indicate that as the people of jonah benefited by his warning  so would the arabs ultimately believe in the prophet muhammad . while this chapter asserts the truth of revelation  it also lays stress on the merciful deal ing of god with mankind . it tells us that he does not send punishment quickly and that evidence of his mercy is also found in nature . it also refers to the histories of noah and moses . this chapter was revealed during the last four years of the makkan period of the holy prophet s life . section 1  truth of revelation in the name of allah  the beneficent  the merciful . 1 i  allah  am the seer .  these are the verses of the book  full of wisdom . 2 is it a wonder to the people that we have revealed to a man from among themselves  warn the people and give good news to those who believe that for them is advancement in excellence c with their lord  the disbelievers say  this is surely an obvious enchanter . 3 surely your lord is allah  who created the heavens and the earth in six periods  and he is established on the throne of power a  11  alif  lam  ra are the three letters which stand at the head of this chapter and chapters 11  12  14 and 15  while chapter 13 has alif  lam  mim  ra . the abbreviation is of the same form as alif  lam  mim  see 21 footnote   except that ra stands for ra     meaning the seer  or ara  meaning  see . chapters 10 to 16 all belong to the last four years of the holy prophet s life at makkah  and deal with the truth of prophethood with more or less reference to the histories of the earlier prophets  four of them being named after a prophet . b  12  the book  i.e . the quran  is called hakim  meaning wise or full of wisdom  because it possesses the quality which discriminates between truth and falsehood and right and wrong  and because it is free from all unsoundness . c  2  the words  advancement in excellence  may also be translated as a footing of firmness . 255 256 10 . jonah 104 regulating the affair .  there is no intercessor except after his per mission . this is allah  your lord  therefore serve him . will you not be mindful  4 to him is your return  of all  of you  . it is the promise of allah  made  in truth . surely he produces the first creation  then he reproduces it  that he may reward with equity those who believe and do good . and as for those who disbelieve  for them is a drink of hot water and a painful punishment because they disbelieved . 5 he it is who made the sun a shining brightness  and the moon a light  and ordained for it stages that you might know the computation of years and the reckoning . allah did not create this but with truth . he makes the signs clear for a people who know . 6 surely in the alternation of the night and the day  and what allah has created in the heavens and the earth  there are signs for a people who keep their duty . c 7 those who do not expect the meeting with us  and are plea sed with this world s life and are satisfied with it  and those who are heedless of our messages â€ ” 8 these  their abode is the fire because of what they earned . 9 those who believe and do good  their lord guides them by their faith  rivers will flow beneath them in gardens of bliss . iâ°their cry therein will be  glory be to you  o allah  and their greeting  peace  and the last of their cry will be  praise be to allah  the lord of the worlds  c a  3  for creation in six periods and the throne of power  see footnotes under 754 . in regulating the affair  there is a further reference to the spiritual evolution of man  as stated more clearly elsewhere   he orders  or regulates  the affair from the heaven to the earth   325  . for intercession  see 2255 footnote 1. b  5  the moon is here called mir because its light is borrowed  as contrasted with the sun which is called here diycc . c  6  the whole of creation is  despite its variety  subject to one law  and clearly bears witness to the unity of its maker . and just as the visible universe is subject to law  there is also a law working in the spiritual world . d  9  the light of faith  which is even in this life a guiding principle of man s actions  will assume a more palpable form in the life after death . compare 5712  where it is called the light running  or gleaming  before them . e  10  this is the muslim paradise  and this description is sufficient to belie 1011 punishment of rejection 257 section 2  punishment of rejection 11 and if allah were to hasten for people the  consequences of  evil  as they would hasten on the good  their doom would cer tainly have been decreed for them . but we leave those alone  who have no hope of meeting with us  in their inordinacy  blindly wandering on . a 12 and when affliction touches man  he calls on us  whether lying on his side or sitting or standing  but  when we remove his affliction from him  he passes on as though he had never called on us on account of an affliction that touched him . thus what they do is made to seem good to the extravagant . 13 and certainly we destroyed generations before you when they did wrong  and their messengers came to them with clear arguments  yet they would not believe . thus do we recompense the guilty people . 14 then we made you rulers in the land after them  so that we might see how you act . 15 and when our clear messages are recited to them  those who have no hope of meeting with us say  bring a quran other than this or change it . say  it is not for me to change it of my own accord . i follow only what is revealed to me . indeed i fear  if i disobey my lord  the punishment of a terrible day . c 16 say  if allah had desired  i would not have recited it to you  nor would he have made it known to you . i have lived among you a lifetime before it . do you not then understand  17 who is then more unjust than he the allegation that the muslim concept of paradise is characterized by sensuality . a  11  people desire and pray for good things to be hastened on to them  and they are hastened on  but in his merciful dealing god does not hasten on the con sequences of evil  so that people may repent and escape those consequences . b  151  they desire a revelation which should not condemn their evil ways and their idol worship  nor contain any threats of their coming doom . c  152  these words show how true the holy prophet himself was to reve lation  translating every one of its precepts into practice . rf  16  the holy prophet s truthfulness and honesty before he received the divine revelation were undisputed  and he had earned such renown for these qualities that he was known as alamin  i.e . the faithful one  or the truthful one . if  as they admitted  he had never told a lie in his lifetime  even for the sake of a personal advantage  how could he  now that he had passed the age of youth  speak falsely  and that to his own detriment  he was not the gainer  but a sufferer thereby  258 10 . jonah 1018 who forges a lie against allah or calls his messages a lie  surely the guilty never succeed . 18 and they serve besides allah that which can neither harm them nor benefit them  and they say  these are our intercessors with allah . say  would you inform allah of what he does not know in the heavens and the earth  glory be to him  and supremely exalted is he above what they set up as partners  with him   19 and  all  people are but a single nation  then they disagree . and if a word had not already gone forth from your lord  the matter would have certainly been decided between them regarding that in which they disagree .  20 and they say  why is not a sign sent to him from his lord  say  the unseen is only for allah  so wait  i too am waiting along with you . section 3  merciful dealing 21 and when we make people taste of mercy after an afflic tion touches them  lo  they devise plans against our messages . say  allah is quicker to plan . surely our messengers write down what you plan . 22 he it is who makes you travel by land and sea  until  when you are in the ships  and they sail on with them in a pleasant breeze  and they rejoice at it  a violent wind overtakes them and waves surge in on them from all sides  and they think they are surrounded . then they pray to allah  being sincere to him in obedience  if you deliver us from this  we will certainly on account of the persecution which his preaching had brought about for him . moreover  a man who had so long refrained from showing any interest in their lives and their modes of worship  and had all but lived the silent life of a recluse among them  could not  of his own accord  be imagined to have suddenly changed the course of his life . a  19  the word that had gone forth is referred to in many places   and they say  when will this promise come to pass  if you are truthful  say  maybe some thing of what you seek to hasten has drawn near to you   277172  . and again   say  you have the appointment of a day which you can not postpone by an hour  nor bring it forward   3430  . b  20  it is clear from the context that their demand is for the punishment with which they are threatened  because they would recognize no other sign  they are told to wait for the sign which would undoubtedly come . 10  23 â€¢ merciful dealing 259 be from among the grateful ones . 23 but when he delivers them  lo  they are unjustly rebellious in the earth . o people  your rebellion is against yourselves â€ ” a provision  only  of this world s life . then to us is your return  so we shall inform you of what you did . 24 the likeness of this world s life is only as water which we send down from the clouds  then the vegetation of the earth  of which people and cattle eat  grows luxuriantly thereby  until when the earth puts on its golden attire and it becomes adorned  and its people think that they are masters of it  our command comes to it  by night or by day  so we render it as reaped seedproduce  as though it had not flourished yesterday . thus do we make clear the messages for a people who reflect . 25 and allah invites to the abode of peace  and guides whom he pleases to the right path . a 26 for those who do good is good  reward  and more  than this  . neither darkness nor disgrace will cover their faces . these are the owners of the garden  in it they will abide . 27 and those who earn evil  the punishment of an evil is the like of it  and humiliation will cover them â€ ” they will have none to protect them from allah â€ ” as if their faces had been covered with slices of the dense darkness of night . these are the companions of the fire  in it they will abide . 28 and on the day when we gather them all together  then we shall say to those who set up partners  with allah   stay where you are  you and your associategods . then we shall separate them from one another  and their associategods will say  it was not us that you served . 29 so allah is sufficient as a witness between a  25  this is another description of the muslim paradise  which is called dar alsalam  or the abode of peace . the word salam in dar alsalam is from the same root as islam . islam  in fact  makes even this world an abode of peace for a true muslim  he makes his peace with his lord  and he lives at peace with his fellow beings . the peace of the next life is  in fact  a continuation of the peace of mind which a muslim finds in this very life . b  26  throughout the quran the reward of virtue is spoken of as being much more than actual recompense  while evil is either spoken of as being forgiven or as being punished only with a like punishment . see 422526 and 6  160 . 260 10 . jonah 1030 us and you that we were quite unaware of your serving  us  . 30 there will every soul become acquainted with what it did before  and they will be brought back to allah  their true patron  and what they devised will escape from them . section 4  uniqueness of divine gifts 31 say  who gives you sustenance from the heaven and the earth  or who controls the hearing and the sight  and who brings forth the living from the dead  and brings forth the dead from the living  and who regulates the affair  they will say  allah . say then  will you not then guard against evil  32 such then is allah  your true lord . and what is there after the truth but error  how then are you turned away  from truth   33 thus does the word of jour lord prove true against those who transgress that they do not believe .  34 say  is there anyone among your associategods who pro duces the first creation  then reproduces it  say  allah produces the first creation  then he reproduces it . how are you then turned away  from truth   35 say  is there any of your associategods who guides to the truth  say  allah guides to the truth . is he then who guides to the truth more worthy to be followed  or he who can not find the way unless he is guided  what is the matter with you  how do you judge  36 and most of them follow only conjec ture . surely conjecture will not avail at all against the truth . truly allah is knower of what they do . 37 and this quran is not such as could be forged by those besides allah  but it is a verification of what is before it and a clear explanation of the book  there is no doubt in it  from the lord of the worlds . 38 0r say they  he has forged it  say  then bring a a  33  the word refers to the fact that their disbelief is a result of their trans gression . b  37  the quran explains in clear words many of the most important prin ciples of religion which are left ambiguous or obscure in the previous books . for instance  the bible is obscure on the important principle of resurrection or life after death . similarly the attributes of the divine being are not explained in clear 1039 the guilty and their punishment 26 1 chapter like it  and call upon whom you can besides allah  if you are truthful . 39 but they reject that whose knowledge they can not encompass and whose final sequel has not yet come to them .  even thus did those before them reject  then see what was the end of the wrongdoers . 40 and some of them believe in it  and some of them do not believe in it . and jour lord best knows the mischief makers . section 5  the guilty and their punishment 41 and if they reject you  say  my work is for me and your work for you . you are clear of what i do and i am clear of what you do . 42 and some of them listen to you . but can you make the deaf to hear  though they will not understand  43 and some of them look at you . but can you show the way to the blind  though they will not see   44 surely allah does not wrong people in the least  but people wrong themselves . 45 and on the day when he will gather them  as though they had not stayed but an hour of the day  they will recognize one another . they perish indeed who reject the meeting with allah  and they do not follow the right way . 46 and if we show you some thing of what we promise them  or cause you to die  before that   yet to us is their return  and allah is witness to what they do . e 47 and for every nation there is a messenger . so when their messen ger comes  the matter is decided between them with justice  and they are not wronged . words and the result is the doctrine of the divinity of jesus christ . the quran fully explains all such points and finally settles all these questions . a  39  the final sequel is the consequence of the rejection of the truth . b  43  compare 7179   they have hearts with which they do not understand  and they have eyes with which they do not see  and they have ears with which they do not hear .  c  46  the significance of the words  to us is their return  is that those who are warned will be dealt with by allah as they deserve  and the warning will prove true . it is no concern of theirs whether the prophet lives to punish them with his own hands or that punishment is executed by allah in some other way . rf  47  compare 3524   and there is not a people but a warner has gone 262 10 . jonah â€¢ 10  48 48 and they say  when will this promise be fulfilled  if you are truthful  49 say  i do not control for myself any harm  or any benefit  except what allah pleases .  every nation has a term . when their term comes  they can not postpone it an hour  nor bring it forward . 50 say  do you see if his punishment comes to you by night or by day  c what  part  of it would the guilty hasten  51 and when it comes to pass  will you believe in it  what  now  and you hastened it on . 52 then will it be said to those who were unjust  taste abiding punishment  you are not recompensed except for what you earned . 53 and they ask you  is that true  say  yes  by my lord  it is surely the truth  and you will not escape . section 6  mercy takes precedence over punishment 54 and if every soul that has done wrong had all that is in the earth  it would offer it for ransom . and they will manifest regret when they see the punishment . and it will be decided between them with justice  and they will not be wronged . 55 now surely whatever is in the heavens and the earth is allah s . now surely allah s promise is true  but most of them do not know . 56 he gives life and causes death  and to him you will be returned . 57 o people  an admonition has indeed come to you from your lord and a healing for what is in the hearts  and a guidance among them  . humanity will always be under the deepest obligation to the holy prophet for this broad humanitarian principle . by  between them  must be under stood the messenger and those who charge him with falsehood . a  491  these are not the words which a pretender would utter but are those of an honest man who  without assuming any personal pretensions  preaches truth in all sincerity . the holy prophet is repeatedly made to disclaim any control of good and evil  so that he offers no low temptation to his followers . truth must be accepted for its own sake  not for any hope of worldly gain or fear of worldly loss . b  492  the verse does not teach fatalism . it lays down a truth which no historian can deny . to every nation  as to every individual  is granted a term of life  and nations live and die like individuals . c  50  the coming of the doom by night or by day signifies its coming at a time when people are engaged in their revelries or occupied with their business transactions  so as to be utterly inattentive to the real values of life . 1058  good news for the faithful 263 and a mercy for the believers .  58 say  in the grace of allah and in his mercy  in that they should rejoice . it is better than what they hoard . 59 say  do you see the sustenance that allah has sent down for you  then you make  a part  of it unlawful and  a part  lawful . say  has allah commanded you or do you forge a lie against allah  60 and what do those think who forge lies against allah of the day of resurrection  surely allah is bountiful to people  but most of them do not give thanks . section 7  good news for the faithful 61 and you are not  engaged  in any matter nor you recite concerning it any portion of the quran  and you do no work  but we are witness of you when you are engaged in it . and not the weight of an atom in the earth or in the heaven is hidden from jour lord  nor anything less than that nor greater  but it is  all  in a clear book  62 now surely the friends of allah  they have no fear nor do they grieve â€ ” 63 those who believe and keep their duty . a  57  they demanded punishment again and again  but they are told that allah has sent to them that in which they will find a healing and a guidance and a mercy for them  viz . the quran . compare 2951  where  in answer to a demand for a sign which should destroy them  the disbelievers are told   is it not enough for them that we have revealed to you  o prophet  the book which is recited to them  surely there is mercy in this and a reminder for a people who believe  . b  59  just as allah gave them the means of their physical sustenance  he has also sent his grace and mercy for their spiritual welfare through revelation . yet they deprive themselves of the spiritual sustenance as if it were unlawful . or the reference may be to their declaring certain things to be unlawful for them out of reverence for their idols . c  61  the clear book mentioned here is not  of course  a collection of written or printed sheets bound together . it is the book of the divine law which makes every deed  good or evil  great or small  bring its recompense . d  62  the friends of allah are those who help the divine cause and invite people to faith in god . they attain to that spiritual height where fear and grief are unknown . there is also a prophecy of the ultimate triumph of truth  for when a man attains his object  all his fear is gone and he no more grieves for the sacri fices he has made . 264 10 . jonah 1064 64 for them is good news a in this world s life and in the hereafter . there is no changing the words of allah . that is the mighty achievement . 65 and do not let their speech grieve yon . surely might belongs wholly to allah . he is the hearer  the knower . 66 now  surely  whatever is in the heavens and whatever is in the earth is allah s . and what do follow those who call on associategods besides allah  they follow nothing but conjecture  and they only lie . 67 he it is who made for you the night that you might rest therein and the day giving light . surely there are signs in this for a people who hear . 68 they say  allah has taken a son  to himself  . glory be to him  he is the selfsufficient . his is what is in the heavens and what is in the earth . you have no authority for this . do you say against allah what you do not know  69 say  those who forge a lie against allah will not succeed . 70 a little enjoyment in this world  then to us is their return  then we shall make them taste severe punishment because they disbelieved . section 8  noah and moses 71 and recite to them the story of noah  when he said to his people  my people  if my staying  here  and my reminding  you  by the messages of allah is hard on you  on allah do i rely  so decide upon your course of action and  gather  your associates . then do not let your course of action be dubious to you  so have it a  641  the holy prophet said   there has remained nothing of prophet hood except mubashsharaty asked what is meant by mubashshardt  he replied   good visions   bukhari  925  . elsewhere good visions are said to be a part of prophethood  bukhari 924   which shows that  as the prophets were informed of the triumph of truth  so will their followers be given this good news in their visions . the upholders of the divine cause  we are told  will not only be success ful  they will also receive the good news of their ultimate triumph in good visions . b  642  the words of allah here signify the prophecies . it is the prophecy of the good reward for the faithful that is mentioned immediately before these words  and the meaning of there being no change is that the prophetic word must be fulfilled  compare similar words used in 634  6115 and 1827 . 10  72 â€¢ noah and moses 265 executed against me and give me no respite . a 72 but if you turn back  i ask for no reward from you . my reward is only with allah  and i am commanded to be of those who submit . 73 but they rejected him  so we delivered him and those with him in the ark  and we made them rulers and drowned those who rejected our messages . see  then  what was the end of those who were warned . 74 then after him we sent messengers to their people . they came to them with clear arguments  but they would not believe what they had rejected before . thus do we seal the hearts of those who exceed the limits . 75 then after them we sent moses and aaron to pharaoh and his chiefs with our signs  but they were arrogant  and they were a guilty people . 76 so when the truth came to them from us  they said  this is surely clear enchantment  77 moses said  do you say  this  of the truth when it has come to you  is it enchantment  and the enchanters never succeed . 78 they said  have you come to us to turn us away from what we found our fathers following  and  that  greatness in the land may be for you two  and we are not going to believe in you . 79 and pharaoh said  bring to me every skilful enchanter . 80 so when the enchanters came  moses said to them  throw down what you are going to throw . 81 so when they had thrown down  moses said  what you have brought is deception . surely allah will make it null . surely allah does not allow the work of mischief makers to thrive . 82 and allah will establish the truth by his words  though the guilty dislike  it  . a  71  the challenge of noah to his opponents was  in fact  being reproduced now as a challenge to the opponents of the holy prophet . and these opponents did  in fact  decide upon their course of action in their great council hall  perhaps a year or two later  and surrounded the prophet s house in accordance with that decision . but the prophet escaped unnoticed from among them and they were unable to lay their hands on him . b  74  they do not ponder over the truth  but  having rejected once  go on opposing its progress without reflecting on it . this condition is described as the sealing of the heart  because the heart ceases to reflect . 266 10 . jonah 1083 section 9  end of opposition to moses 83 but  on account of the fear of pharaoh and their chiefs persecuting them  none believed in moses except a few of his people .  and pharaoh was truly highhanded in the land  and surely he was one committing excesses . 84 and moses said  my people  if you believe in allah  then rely on him if you submit  to him  . 85 they said  on allah we rely  our lord  do not make us a trial for the unjust people . 86 and deliver us by your mercy from the disbelieving people . 87 and we revealed to moses and his brother  take for your people houses to abide in egypt and make your houses places of worship and keep up prayer . and give good news to the belie vers . 88 and moses said  our lord  surely you have given pharaoh and his chiefs finery and riches in this world s life  our lord  that they may lead  people  astray from your way . c our lord  destroy their riches and harden their hearts  so that they do not believe till they see the painful punishment . 89 he said  your prayer is accep ted  so continue in the right way and do not follow the path of those who do not know . 90 and we brought the children of israel across the sea . then pharaoh and his armies followed them for oppression and tyranny  till  when drowning overtook him  he said  i believe that there is no god but he in whom the children of israel believe  and i am of those who submit . 6 91 what  now  and indeed before  this  you a  83  the israelites believed in moses as the verses that follow show . by his people  therefore  are meant pharaoh s wife  6611  and a believer  4028  . b  87  the qiblah is that facing which one prays  and therefore it indicates a place of worship . the israelites were obliged to pray in their houses because they did not enjoy full religious liberty in egypt and had no public places of worship . c  881  the significance is not that god had granted them riches to mislead people  but that this was the end for which they used their riches . d  882  pharaoh and his people did not care for either arguments or signs . moses therefore now prays for their punishment . e  90  in the agonies of death  even pronounced atheists have sometimes recognized the existence of god . 10  92 â€¢ those who heed warning will benefit 267 disobeyed and you were a mischiefmaker  92 but this day we shall save you in your body that you may be a sign to those after you . and surely most of the people are heedless of our signs section 10  those who heed warning will benefit 93 and certainly we lodged the children of israel in a goodly abode and provided them with good things . then they did not dif fer till the knowledge came to them . surely your lord will judge between them on the day of resurrection in that in which they differed . 94 but if you are in doubt as to what we have revealed to you  ask those who read the book before you . c certainly the truth has come to you from your lord  so do not be one of the doubters  95 nor be of those who reject the messages of allah   for  then you will be from among the losers . 96 surely those against whom the word of your lord has proved true will not believe  97 though every sign should come to them  till they see the painful punishment . a  92  that the body was really cast ashore  though the bible does not mention it  is clear from the fact that the body of rameses ii  who is regarded as the pharaoh of moses  has been discovered as preserved among the mummies in egypt . this is another instance of the insufficiency of the bible narrative and of the truth of the quranic statement where it supplements the bible . the discovery now made could not have been known to the holy prophet  it was not known to any person in the world till very recently . b  93  this may be a prophetical announcement as to the jewish attitude towards the prophet muhammad later on when he fled to madinah . c  94  the person addressed in the quran in the singular form is not always the prophet but often the reader  as here . nor do the words revealed to you  in the singular  show that the prophet is meant  for the quran is in many places spoken of as being revealed to all the people  see 2136  2110  . verse 104 makes it clear that the reader is addressed   say  o people  if you are in doubt as to my religion  . throughout the quran the holy prophet appears as having the greatest certainty about the word which was revealed to him  so much so that he never entertained the slightest doubt about the truth of the promises of future success and triumph . in the very next verse the words are  nor be of those who reject the messages of allah  which shows clearly that it is the prophet s opponents who are addressed here . the words  ask those who read the book before you  mean  ask them whether previous revelation does not contain clear prophecies of the advent of such a prophet . 268 10 . jonah â€¢ 10  98 98 and why was there not a town which believed  so that their belief should have benefited them  but the people of jonah  when they believed  we removed from them the punishment of disgrace in this world s life  and we gave them provision for a while .   and if your lord had pleased  all those who are in the earth would have believed  all of them . will you then force people till they are believers  100 and it is not for any soul to believe except by allah s permission . and he casts uncleanness on those who will not understand 101 say  look at what is in the heavens and the earth  and signs and warners do not avail a people who do not believe . iâ° 2 what do they wait for  then  but the like of the days of those who passed away before them  say  wait then  i too am waiting along with you . 103 then we deliver our messengers and those who believe â€ ” even so  now   it is binding on us to deliver the believers . section 1 1  divine judgment 104 say  o people  if you are in doubt as to my religion   know that  i do not serve those whom you serve besides allah  but i serve allah  who causes you to die  and i am commanded to be one of the believers  105 and that you set yourself for the religion  a  98  jonah bears a resemblance to the holy prophet in that his people benefited by the warning  as did the arabs by the warning of the prophet  though after much opposition . jonah is thus the type of a prophet whose people were dealt with mercifully . b  99  compare 2256   there is no compulsion in religion  . the reference is to the great zeal of the holy prophet and his overexerting himself in preaching the truth   then perhaps you will kill yourself with grief  sorrowing after them  if they do not believe in this announcement   186  .  editor s note  the quran tells us here that it is in the natural order of things that while some people believe  others do not  and no human being can or should apply compulsion to others in this regard .  c  100  those who refuse to understand the truth will find uncleanness cast on them . the word rijs   uncleanness   also means punishment  and the meaning  in that case  is that those who care not for the warning must receive the punish ment . 10106  divine judgment 269 being upright  and do not be of those who set up partners  with allah  . iâ° 6 nor call besides allah on that which can neither benefit you nor harm you  for if you do  you shall then be of the unjust . 107 and if allah afflicts you with harm  there is none to remove it but he  and if he intends good to you  there is none to repel his grace . he brings it to whom he pleases of his servants . and he is the forgiving  the merciful . 108 say  o people  the truth has indeed come to you from your lord  so whoever goes aright  goes aright only for the good of his own soul  and whoever goes astray  goes astray only to its detriment . and i am not a custodian over you . 109 and follow what is revealed to you and be patient till allah give judgment  and he is the best of the judges . chapter 1 1 hud the history of the prophet hud is referred to in this chapter . while the last chapter dealt mostly with abstract questions relating to the truth of revelation  this chapter illustrates the truth of those questions by referring to the histories of former prophets . thus it deals with the histories of noah  hud  salih  abraham  lot and shuaib . a cruel and persecuting enemy is warned of the fate that befell previous people . this chapter was revealed during the last four years of the period of the holy prophet s life at makkah . section 1  a warning in the name of allah  the beneficent  the merciful . 1 i  allah  am the seer . a book  whose verses are charac terized by wisdom  then they are made plain  from one wise  aware  2 that you should serve none but allah . surely i am to you from him a warner and a giver of good news . 3 and ask for giveness of your lord  then turn to him . he will provide you with a goodly provision to an appointed term  and will bestow his grace on every one endowed with grace . a and if you turn away  i fear for you the punishment of a great day . 4 to allah is your return  and he is powerful over all things . 5 now surely they cover up their breasts to conceal  their enmity  from him . now surely  when they put their garments as a covering  he knows what they hide and what they make public . surely he is knower of what is in the breasts . j  6 and there is no animal in the earth but on allah is the sus â « â– tenance of it  and he knows its abode and its repository . all is in a a  3  one endowed with grace here is the possessor of spiritual blessings in addition to the material benefits spoken of in the preceding words . b  5  this expression indicates their trying not to see or hear  or holding back from lending an ear  or it is an allusion to their running away . 270 11  7 â€¢ truth of revelation 271 clear record . 7 and he it is who created the heavens and the earth in six periods  and his throne of power is ever on water  that he might manifest  the good qualities in  you  whoever of you is best in deeds . and if you say  you shall surely be raised up after death  those who disbelieve say  this is nothing but clear deceit . 8 and if we delay for them the punishment for a stated period  they will certainly say  what prevents it  now surely on the day when it will come to them  it will not be averted from them  and what they mocked at will beset them . section 2  truth of revelation 9 and if we make man taste mercy from us  then withdraw it from him  he is surely despairing  ungrateful . 10 and if we make him taste a favour after distress has afflicted him  he says  the evils are gone away from me . certainly he is exultant  boastful  1 except those who are patient and do good . for them is forgive ness and a great reward . 12 then  may it be that you will give up part of what is revealed to you and your heart will be distressed by it  because they say  why has not a treasure been sent down for him or an angel come with him  c fou are only a warner . and allah is in a  71  for the meaning of arsh or throne of power see 754 footnote 2 . the great power of god which is manifested in the creation of man is connected with water because physical life grows out of water . similarly  spiritual life grows out of revelation  which is so often compared with rain or water . god s great power has thus been made manifest through water  and hence with the creation of the heavens and the earth is mentioned the fact that god s throne of power is ever on the waters . the words that follow make it clearer still . b  72  the object of the creation of man and all that has been brought into existence is that the great qualities with which man is endowed should be mani fested . but that manifestation  we are told in the words that follow  takes place not in this life but in the life after death . c  12  this passage does not signify that the prophet intended to give up any part of the revelation  on the other hand  it is a strong statement indicating that he could not do it . it is a peculiar use of the word la alia   maybe   . when it is in tended to show a person s remoteness from a thing  it is said  maybe he has power to do such a thing . 272 11 . hud 1113 charge of all things . 13 or  say they  he has forged it . say  then bring ten forged chapters like it  and call upon whom you can besides allah  if you are truthful .  14 but if they do not answer you  then know that it is revealed by allah s knowledge  and that there is no god but he . will you then submit   15 whoever desires this world s life and its finery â€ ” we repay them their deeds in it  and they are not made to suffer loss in it . 16 these are they for whom there is nothing but fire in the here after . and what they work in it is fruitless and their deeds are futile . e 17 is he then  like these  who has with him clear proof from his lord  and a witness from him recites it  and before it  is  the book of moses  a guide and a mercy  these believe in it . and whoever of the parties disbelieves in it  the fire is his promised place . so do not be in doubt about it . surely it is the truth from jour lord  but most people do not believe . a  13  see also 223 and footnote . this challenge is contained in four different chapters of the quran . the earliest in point of revelation is 1788   say  if people and jinn should combine together to bring the like of this quran  they could not bring the like of it  though some of them were aiders of others .  then in the verse above  the demand is reduced to ten chapters . lastly in 1038 and 223 they are challenged to produce a single chapter like the quran . another point worth noting is that  while in 1788 people and jinn are challenged  in 223 the word shuhada   which means helpers  leaders or their great or learned men  is substituted for jinn  thus showing that jinn in 1788 are only human beings . b  14  if the false gods or the leaders do not answer their devotees when they call on them to assist them in producing a like of the quran  then at least no doubt should be left in their minds that the quran is not the work of the prophet  but a revelation from the divine being . c  16  that is  their deeds will not result in any good to them . d  l  he who has with him clear proof from his lord applies to every believer in the truth of the quran  the words these believe in it  occurring further on  make this clear . the witness from allah  who recites it  is the holy prophet  who is called a witness elsewhere  as being an exemplar for the believers . besides being a clear proof in itself  the quran has a further evidence of its truth in the book of moses  which is  therefore  called a guide and a mercy  because it con tains clear prophecies of the truth of the prophet . the meaning of the whole passage is  he who  being a believer in the truth of the quran  has clear proof from his lord  and who has an exemplar for him in the person of the holy prophet  and has additional testimony of his truth in the book of moses  is not like 1118 history of noah 273 18 and who is more unjust than he who forges a lie against allah  these will be brought before their lord  and the witnesses will say   these are they who lied against their lord . now surely the curse of allah is on the wrongdoers  19 who hinder  people  from the path of allah and desire to make it crooked . and they are disbelievers in the hereafter . 20 these will not escape in the earth  nor do they have guardians besides allah . the punishment will be doubled for them . they could not bear to hear  c and they did not see . 21 these are they who have lost their souls  and what they forged is gone from them . 22 truly in the hereafter they are the greatest losers . 23 surely those who believe and do good and humble them selves before their lord  these are the owners of the garden  in it they will abide . 24 the likeness of the two parties is as the blind and the deaf  and the seer and the hearer . are they equal in con dition  will you not then be mindful  section 3  history of noah 25 and certainly we sent noah to his people  saying   surely i am a plain warner to you  26 to serve none but allah . indeed i fear for you the punishment of a painful day . 27 but the chiefs of his people who disbelieved said  we do not see you but  as  a mortal like us  nor do we see that any follow you but those who are the lowest of us at first thought . nor do we see in you any superiority over us  no  we think you to be liars . 28 he said  my people  do you see if i have with me clear proof from my lord  and he has granted me mercy from himself him who loves this world and cares not for the truth . the latter statement  being included in the previous verses  is omitted here . a  18  the witnesses are according to some the angels  according to others  the prophets â€ ” and this is corroborated by 441  according to still others the believers . b  201  they would not escape the punishment  if allah intended to punish them in this world . c  202  they could not bear even to hear what the prophet said . 274 11 . hud 1129 and it has been made obscure to you  can we compel you to  accept  it while you dislike it  29 and  my people  i do not ask you for wealth  in return  for it . my reward is only with allah  and i am not going to drive away those who believe . surely they will meet their lord  but i see you a people who are ignorant . 30 and  my people  who will help me against allah  if i drive them away  will you not then be mindful  31 and i do not say to you that i have the treasures of allah  nor do i know the unseen  nor do i say that i am an angel . nor do i say about those whom your eyes scorn that allah will not grant them  any  good â€ ” allah knows best what is in their souls â€ ” for then indeed i should be of the wrongdoers . 32 they said  noah  indeed you have disputed with us and prolonged dispute with us  so bring upon us what you threaten us with  if you are truthful . 33 he said  only allah will bring it on you  if he please  and you will not escape  34 and my advice will not benefit you  if i intend to give you good advice  if allah intends to destroy you . he is your lord  and to him you will be brought back . 35 or do they say  he has forged it  say  if i have forged it  on me is my guilt  and i am free of what you are guilty ofâ° section 4  history of noah 36 and it was revealed to noah  none of jour people will believe except those who have already believed  so do not grieve at what they do  37 and make the ark under our eyes and our reve lation  and do not speak to me on behalf of those who are unjust . surely they will be drowned . 38 and he began to make the ark . and whenever the chiefs of his people passed by him  they laughed at him . he said  if you a  35  the change shows positively that the disbelievers of makkah are meant  and the reference is to their calling the quran a forgery . this shows that the histories of the prophets are referred to in the quran as a warning for the holy prophet s opponents . 11  39 â€¢ history of noah 275 laugh at us  surely we  too  laugh at you as you laugh  at us  . a 39 so you shall know who it is on whom will come a punishment which will disgrace him  and on whom a lasting punishment will fall . 40 at length when our command came and water gushed forth from the valley   we said  carry in it two of all things  a pair  c and jour own family â€ ” except those against whom the word has already gone forth â€ ” and those who believe . and only a few believed with him . 41 and he said  embark in it  in the name of allah be its sailing and its anchoring . surely my lord is forgiv ing  merciful . 42 and it moved on with them amid waves like mountains . and noah called out to his son  who was apart  my son  embark with us and do not be with the disbelievers . 43 he said  i will take refuge on a mountain that will save me from the water . a  38  the laughing of the righteous at the wicked is not to be taken literally . you laugh at a thing to show your contempt for it  just as the disbelieving people showed their contempt for the making of the ark  the believer in divine promise shows his contempt for their opposition and their plans to destroy him . b  401  far altanniir has often been translated as the oven poured forth water or the oven boiled or the earth s surface boiled up . but the meaning of fara which suits the context here  is not of boiling  but of water spouting forth  and that of tannur applicable here is not oven but a place where the water of a valley collects . c  402  by all things are meant all things needed by noah  and not all things existing in the world  which was too extensive for noah to travel over . d  42  the quran does not support the story that the deluge covered the whole surface of the earth . on the other hand  it repeatedly speaks of noah as having been sent to his people  i.e . to a single tribe  and according to the divine law the punishment must have overtaken his people  who not only rejected the truth  but also sought to destroy noah and his followers . the mention of the water flowing from the valley also shows that it was only a tract of land that was deluged  and not the entire earth . the taking in of a pair of all things does not mean that noah had travelled over the whole earth and taken a pair of every living animal wherever it could be found . the order is clearly to take in pairs of all those things that he considered necessary for himself and those who were with him in the ark . the bible narrative  which speaks of god  bringing floodwaters on the earth  to des troy from under heaven all flesh in which is the breath of life    genesis  617   and then makes noah collect and lodge in an ark a pair of each of the thousands of animals and birds  can not be accepted . 276 11 . hud 1144 he said  there is none safe today from allah s command  but he on whom he has mercy . and a wave intervened between them  so he was among the drowned . 44 and it was said  o earth  swallow your water  and o cloud  clear away . and the water was made to subside  and the affair was decided  and it rested on the judi   and it was said  away with the wrongdoing people  45 and noah cried to his lord and said  my lord  surely my son is of my family  and your promise is true  and you are the most just of the judges . 46 he said  o noah  he is not of your family  he is  an embodiment of  unrighteous conduct . so do not ask of me that of which you have no knowledge . i admo nish you so you may not be of the ignorant ones . 47 he said  my lord  i seek refuge in you from asking of you that of which 1 have no knowledge . and unless you forgive me and have mercy on me  i shall be among the losers . 48 it was said  o noah  descend with peace from us and blessing on you and on nations  spring ing  from those with you . and there are nations whom we afford provisions  then a painful punishment from us afflicts them . 49 these are announcements relating to the unseen which we reveal to you  you did not know them â€ ”  neither  you nor your people â€ ” before this . so be patient . surely the  good  end is for the dutiful . c a  44  the greek name of this mountain is said to be gordyoei  being one of those mountains which divide armenia on the south from mesopotamia  iraq  . b  46  when it is meant to speak of a person as the very embodiment of a certain quality  he is designated not as the possessor of that quality  but as that quality itself . in 2177 it is said  literally  righteousness is the one who believes  the meaning being that such a person is the embodiment of righteousness . c  49  the announcement relating to the unseen is the fate of the opponents of the holy prophet as read in noah s history . the words that follow â€ ” be patient â€ ” are a clear indication  for patient waiting was needed for the fate of the prophet s opponents  not for anything relating to noah s history . 1 1  50 â€¢ history of hud 277 section 5  history of hud 50 and to ad  we sent  their brother hfid . fl he said  my people  serve allah  you have no god other than him . you are only fabricators . 51 my people  i ask of you no reward for it . my reward is only with him who created me . do you not then under stand  52 and  my people  ask forgiveness of your lord  then turn to him  he will send on you clouds pouring down abundance of rain and add strength to your strength  and do not turn back  guilty . 53 they said  hud  you have brought us no clear argument  and we are not going to desert our gods for jour word  and we are not believers in you . 54 we say nothing but that some of our gods have struck you with evil . he said  surely i call allah to witness  and you should bear witness too  that i am innocent of what you set up  with allah  55 besides him . so scheme against me all together  then give me no respite . 56 surely i put my trust in allah  my lord and your lord . there is no living creature but he grasps it by its forelock . surely my lord is on the right path . 57 but if you turn away  then indeed i have delivered to you the message with which i am sent to you . and my lord will bring another people in your place  and you can not do him any harm . surely my lord is the preserver of all things . 58 and when our commandment came to pass  we delivered hud and those who believed with him with mercy from us  and we delivered them from a hard punishment . 59 and such were ad . they denied the messages of their lord  and disobeyed his messen gers and followed the bidding of every insolent opposer  of truth  . 60 and they were overtaken by a curse in this world and on the day of resurrection . now surely ad disbelieved in their lord . now surely  away with ad  the people of hud  a  50  see 765 footnote . b  56  my lord is on the right path signifies that he does not deviate from justice . 278 11 . hud  11  61 section 6  history of salih 61 and to thamud  we sent  their brother salih . a he said  my people  serve allah  you have no god other than him . he brought you forth from the earth and made you dwell in it  so ask forgiveness of him  then turn to him . surely my lord is near  answering . 62 they said  salih  you were among us a centre of  our  hopes before this . do you forbid us to worship what our fathers worshipped  and surely we are in grave doubt about that to which you call us . 63 he said  my people  do you see if i have clear proof from my lord and he has granted me mercy from himself â€ ” who will then help me against allah  if i disobey him  so you would add to me nothing but perdition . 64 and  my people  this is allah s shecamel  a sign for you  so leave her to pasture on allah s earth and do her no harm  or a punishment will soon come upon you . 65 but they hamstrung her  so he said  enjoy yourselves in your houses for three days . that is a promise not to be belied . 66 so when our commandment came to pass  we saved salih and those who believed with him by mercy from us from the dis grace of that day . surely jour lord â€ ” he is the strong  the mighty . 67 and the cry overtook those who did wrong  e so they were motion less bodies in their abodes  68 as though they had never dwelt in them . now surely thamud disbelieved in their lord . so away with thamud  section 7  abraham and lot 69 and certainly our messengers came to abraham with good news . they said  peace   peace    said he . and he made no delay a  61  see 773 footnote 1. b  64  see 773 footnote 2. c  67  it was an earthquake . see 778. d  69  whether they were angels or men  is not made clear here or anywhere else in the quran . but as they did not partake of food  and the fact that they brought to abraham news of a son and of the destruction of lot s people  they are generally looked upon as angels who appeared in the similitude of men . 1 1  70 â€¢ abraham and lot 279 in bringing a roasted calf . 70 but when he saw that their hands did not reach to it  he mistrusted them and conceived fear of them . they said  do not fear  we have been sent to lot s people . 71 and his wife was standing  by   so she wondered .  then we gave her the good news of isaac  and beyond isaac  of jacob .  72 she said  o wonder  e shall i bear a son when i am an extremely old woman  and this my husband an extremely old man  this is a wonderful thing indeed  73 they said  do you wonder at allah s commandment  the mercy of allah and his blessings be on you  people of the house  surely he is praised  glorious . 74 so when fear departed from abraham and good news came to him  he began to plead with us for lot s people . 75 surely abraham was forbearing  tenderhearted  oftreturning  to allah  . 76 abraham  cease from this . surely the decree of jour lord has gone forth and a punishment must come to them which can not be averted . 77 and when our messengers came to lot  he was grieved for them  and he was unable to protect them  and said  this is a distressful day  78 and his people came to him   as if  driven on towards him  and they were used to the doing of evil deeds before . he said  my a  711  it is made clear in 5 1 2434 that the news of the birth of a son was given to abraham first . this explains sarah s wonder . it was after receiving the good news of the birth of a son that abraham was informed of the destruction of lot s people . the statement made further on that sarah was given the good news of the birth of a son is by way of reassurance on her expression of wonder  and to give the further news of a son s son  jacob . 6  712  compare genesis 181012 . the mention of a son s son  jacob  was to show that that son should have progeny . the word ward    beyond   also means a son s son . elsewhere jacob is expressly called nafilah  2172  which means a grandson . c  72  the original words yd wailatd  while used to express grief and sorrow  are also used to express wonder . d  73  am albait   people of the house   includes the wife of a person  in fact  it is abraham s wife who is primarily addressed here . the same phrase in the case of the holy prophet  3333  includes his wives as well as his children . 280 11 . hud 1179 people  these are my daughters â€ ” they are purer for you  so guard against  the punishment of  allah and do not disgrace me about my guests . is there not among you any rightminded man   79 they said  certainly you know that we have no claim on jour daughters  and you know what we desire . 80 he said  if only i had the power to repel you  â€ ” rather i shall have recourse to a strong support . 81 they said  lot  we are the messengers of jour lord . they shall not reach you . so travel with your people for a part of the night â€ ” and let none of you turn back â€ ” except your wife . surely whatsoever befalls them shall befall her . surely their appointed time is the morning . is not the morning near  82 so when our decree came to pass  we turned them upside down  and rained on them stones  as decreed  one after another  c 83 marked  for punishment  with your lord . and it is not far off from the wrongdoers . a  78  lot  it appears from genesis 199  was a stranger in the city  and the messengers being strangers  the townsmen would not allow him to keep them . lot offered his daughters as hostages so that he might be allowed to keep his guests with him  for according to 1570 he had not permission to allow any stranger to come under his roof . another view is that lot offered his daughters for marriage  as thus he would not be a stranger among them but would be one of them . some commentators have suggested that lot did not point to his real daughters  but to women of the tribe  because a prophet would speak of the women of his tribe as his daughters  and in that case he did no more than point to the natural relation of man and woman . the answer of his people seems  however  to relate to his daughters . b  80  allah is the strong support to whom the righteous have recourse when they are in trouble . the particle au signifies or  as well as rather . c  82  it was a severe earthquake  which so utterly demolished the cities as to turn them upside down . in 1573 it is called a rumbling that precedes an earth quake  see 784 . the raining down of stones might have been the result of a volca nic eruption which was accompanied by an earthquake . rf  83  the concluding words indicate a reversion to the subject of the punishment of the opponents of the holy prophet . it refers to the punishment . 1 1  84 â€¢ history of shuaib 281 section 8  history of shuaib 84 and to midian  we sent  their brother shuaib . he said  my people  serve allah  you have no god other than him . and do not give short measure and weight . i see you in prosperity  and i fear for you the punishment of an allencompassing day . 85 and  my people  give full measure and weight justly  and do not defraud people of their things  nor act corruptly in the land  making mischief . 86 what remains with allah is better for you  if you are believers .  and i am not a keeper over you . 87 they said  shuaib  does jour prayer enjoin you that we should give up what our fathers worshipped or that we should not do what we please with regard to our property  so you are the one who is the forbearing  the rightdirecting  88 he said  my people  do you see if i have a clear proof from my lord and he has given me a goodly sustenance from himself  and i do not desire to act in opposition to you  in what i forbid you . i desire nothing but reform  so far as i am able . and with none but allah is the direction of my affair to a right issue . in him i trust and to him i turn . 89 and  my people  do not let opposition to me make you guilty so that there may befall you the like of what befell the people of noah  or the people of hud  or the people of salih . nor are the people of lot far off from you . 90 and ask forgiveness of your lord  then turn to him . surely my lord is merciful  lovingkind . 91 they said  shuaib  we do not understand much of what you say and surely we see you to be weak among us . and if it were not for your family  we would surely stone you  and you are not strong against us . 92 he said  my people  is my family more esteemed by you than allah  and you neglect him as a thing cast behind your backs  surely my lord encompasses what you do . 93 and  my a  86  baqiyyat allah would properly signify that part of man s doing which remains with allah  i.e.  the righteous or good works  of which the recompense remains  the word conveying the same significance as bdqiydt in 1846 and 1976 . but it may also mean what allah leaves to you after you have paid the dues of others . 282 11 . hud 1194 people  act according to your ability  i too am acting . you will soon know upon whom will come the punishment  that will dis grace him  and who is a liar . and watch  surely i too am watching with you . 94 and when our decree came to pass  we delivered shuaib and those who believed with him by mercy from us . and the cry overtook those who did wrong  so they were motionless bodies in their abodes  95 as though they had never dwelt in them . so away with midian  just as thamud perished  section 9  the wrongdoers and the righteous 96 and certainly we sent moses with our signs and a clear authority  97 to pharaoh and his chiefs  but they followed the bid ding of pharaoh  and pharaoh s bidding was not rightdirecting . 98 he will lead his people on the day of resurrection  and bring them down to the fire . and evil the place to which they are brought   and they are followed by a curse in this  world   and on the day of resurrection . evil the gift which shall be given  100 this is an account of the towns which we relate to you . of them are some that stand and  others  mown down . 101 and we did not wrong them but they wronged themselves . and their gods whom they called upon besides allah did not avail them in the least when the decree of your lord came to pass . and they added to them nothing but ruin . 102 and such is the punishment of your lord  when he punishes the towns while they are wrongdoers . surely his punishment is painful  severe . 103 surely there is a sign in this for him who fears the punishment of the hereafter . that is a day on which people will be gathered together  and that is a day to be witnessed . 104 and we do not delay it but for an appointed term . 105 on the day when it comes  no soul will speak except by his permission  so  some  of them will be unhappy and  others  happy . 106 then as for those who are unhappy  they will be in the fire  for them there will be in it sighing and groaning â€ ” 11107  believers are comforted 283 107 abiding in it so long as the heavens and the earth endure  except as your lord please . surely your lord is doer of what he intends 108 and as for those who are made happy  they will be in the garden abiding in it so long as the heavens and the earth endure  except as your lord please â€ ” a gift never to be cut off .  109 so do not be in doubt as to what these  people  worship . they worship only as their fathers worshipped before . and surely we shall pay them in full their due undiminished . section 10  believers are comforted 110 and indeed we gave moses the book  but differences arose concerning it . and if a word had not already gone forth from your lord  judgment would have been given between them . and they are surely in a disquieting doubt about it . m and your lord will surely pay back to all their deeds in full . he indeed is aware of what they do . 112 continue  then  in the right way as you are commanded  as also  should  those who turn  to allah  with you . and do not be a  107  this limitation on the duration of abiding in hell â€ ” except as your lord please â€ ” is given here and in 6128  showing clearly that the punishment of hell is not everlasting . the next verse states that those in paradise will abide there as long as the heavens and the earth endure   except as your lord please   but this statement is immediately followed by another  a gift never to be cut off . this shows that in fact there is no limitation upon the eternity of paradise  and the words except as your lord please have been used  in the case of paradise  only to express the unbounded power of the divine being and the fact that it is due to god s pleasure that they are there . in the case of hell  however  the words except as your lord please are followed by a statement which corroborates the limitation thus placed  for  fa  al or doer  as an attribute of god  indicates that he does even those things which seem impossible to others . three times in the quran  4169  3365  7223  abiding in hell for abad is mentioned  which is generally considered as meaning forever . however  abad signifies a long time as well as time without end . the quran makes clear in 7823 that a long time is meant as it states there that the disbelievers will remain in hell for ahqdb  i.e . long years . b  108  in accordance with what is said here  that heavenly life is a gift never to be cut off  we have in 1548   nor will they be ejected from there  . 284 11 . hud â€¢ 11  113 inordinate  o people  . surely he is seer of what you do . 113 and do not incline to those who do wrong  so that the fire touch you  and you have no protectors besides allah  then you would not be helped . 114 and keep up prayer at the two ends of the day and in the first hours of the night .  surely good deeds take away evil deeds . this is a reminder for the mindful . 115 and be patient  for surely allah does not waste the reward of the doers of good . 116 why were there not  then  among the generations before you  those possessing understanding who forbade mischief in the earth except a few among them whom we delivered  and the unjust pursued the enjoyment of plenty  and they were guilty . n7 and jour lord would not destroy towns unjustly  while their people acted well . c 118 and if your lord pleased  he would have made people a single nation and they do not cease to differ  119 except those on whom your lord has mercy  and for this did he create them . and the word of your lord is fulfilled  i will cer tainly fill hell with jinn and people  all together . e a  113  not only is man forbidden to do any wrong himself  but he should keep himself at a safe distance from wrong and refrain from leaning towards the wrongdoers . b  114  the times of prayer are clearly indicated here . of the two ends of the day  the first is the fajr  or the prayer before sunrise  and the second includes the zuhr  or the early afternoon  and the asr  or the later afternoon  prayers . in the first hours of the night we have the maghrib  or the after sunset prayer  and the isha   or the prayer before going to bed . the two afternoon prayers and the two after sunset prayers  which are spoken of together  may under exceptional circum stances be said together in each case . c  117  god does not destroy people unjustly . he destroys them only when they act corruptly and make mischief in the world . he would not destroy them if they act well  whatever their beliefs . most of the commentators take the word zulm  injustice in the word  unjustly   here as meaning shirk or setting up partners with god  and the meaning becomes that god would not destroy people  even though they were guilty of shirk  provided they acted well . the translation in this case would be  your lord would not destroy towns for wrong beliefs  while their people acted well . rf  118  god does not force people to one particular belief . he has given them the choice to accept or reject the truth . e  119  here it is clearly stated that allah created all human beings to have 11120  believers are comforted 285 120 and all we relate to you from the account of the messen gers is to strengthen jour heart with it . and in this has come to you the truth and an admonition and a reminder for the believers . 121 and say to those who do not believe  act according to your power  surely we too are acting  122 and wait  surely we too are waiting . 123 and allah s is the unseen in the heavens and the earth  and to him the whole affair will be returned . so serve him and put jour trust in him . and jour lord is not heedless of what you do . mercy on them . by his mercy he guides some to the right path  while to others  who go over to evil and make themselves deserving of hell  mercy will come only after suffering . it is by their own hands that they get into distress and difficulty  while allah has mercy on them in extricating them from it . the filling of hell with jinn and people would be because they went against the ways which allah had mercifully shown to them . therefore they must pass through another ordeal  so that they may be purged of evil and made fit for spiritual progress . chapter 12 yusuf joseph this entire chapter gives a continuous account of the history of joseph . at the beginning and the end it indicates that the purpose is to foretell the ultimate triumph of the holy prophet muhammad and the final submission of those who were plotting against his life . it is also prophesied here that the mutual dealings of the holy prophet and his enemies would be similar to the deal ings of joseph and his brothers  they would persecute him but he would forgive them when they would ultimately come before him in submission . this chapter was revealed during the last four years of the period of the holy prophet s life at makkah . section 1  truth of revelation in the name of allah  the beneficent  the merciful . 1 i  allah  am the seer . these are the verses of the book that makes manifest . 2 surely we have revealed it â€ ” an arabic quran â€ ” that you may understand . 3 we narrate to you the best of narratives  in that we have revealed to you this quran  though before this you were of those who are unaware . 4 when joseph said to his father  my father  i saw eleven stars and the sun and the moon â€ ” i saw them making submission to me . 5 he said  my son  do not relate your dream to your a  31  it is called the best narrative because it is the best picture of the dealing of the quraish with the holy prophet  and the prophet s dealing with them . it was in the very words of joseph to his brothers â€ ” there is no reproach against you this day  v. 92  â€ ” that the holy prophet forgave the people of makkah all the atrocities they had committed against him . b  32  the holy prophet s  unawareness  relates to his own future  of which this chapter gives a clear indication in the incidents of joseph s life  viz . that he was to be expelled from his home but that his countrymen would ulti mately come to him in submission  asking pardon for their faults . but  unaware ness  here may also refer to all those things that are related in the quran  because the prophet knew nothing of them before revelation . 286 126  plot against joseph by his brothers 287 brothers  in case they devise a plan against you . the devil indeed is an open enemy to man . 6 and thus will jour lord choose you and teach you the interpretation of sayings  and make his favour complete to you and to the children of jacob  as he made it complete before to your fathers  abraham and isaac . surely your lord is knowing  wise . section 2  plot against joseph by his brothers 7 surely in joseph and his brothers there are signs for the inquirers . a 8 when they said  certainly joseph and his brother are dearer to our father than we  though we are a  strong  company . surely our father is in clear error â€ ” kill joseph or banish him to some  other  land  so that your father s regard may be exclusively for you  and after that you may be a righteous peopled 10 a speaker among them said  do not kill joseph  but  if you are going to do anything  cast him down to the bottom of the well . some of the travellers may pick him up . 11 they said  our father  why do you not trust us with joseph  and surely we are his sincere wellwishers  12 send him with us tomorrow that he may enjoy himself and play  and we shall surely guard him well . 13 he said  indeed it grieves me that you should take him away and i fear that the wolf may eat him while you are careless of him . 14 they said  if the wolf should eat him while we are so many  we should then certainly be losers . 15 so when they took him away and agreed to put him down at the bottom of the pit  we revealed to him  7ou will certainly a  7  by inquirers are meant people who inquired about the holy prophet  who was at this time being persecuted most severely by the people of makkah . they are told in plain words that the story of the prophet and his opponents was the story of joseph and his brothers . b  8  benjamin  his brother by the same mother  is meant here . c  9  the conspiracy of the quraish against the holy prophet is referred to in the quran in the words  and when those who disbelieved devised plans against you that they might confine you or kill you or drive you away   830  . 288 12 . joseph 1216 inform them of this affair of theirs while they do not realize 16 and they came to their father at nightfall  weeping . 17 they said  our father  we went off racing with one another and left joseph by our goods  so the wolf ate him . and you will not believe us  though we are truthful . 18 and they came with false blood on his shirt . he said  indeed  your souls have made it a light matter for you . so patience is best . and allah is he whose help is sought against what you describe . 19 and travellers came  and they sent their waterdrawer and he let down his bucket . he said  good news  this is a youth . and they concealed him as an article of merchandise  and allah knew what they did . 20 and they sold him for a small price  a few pieces of silver  and they showed no desire for him . section 3  joseph s firmness under temptation 21 and the egyptian who bought him said to his wife  make his stay honourable . maybe he will be useful to us  or we may adopt him as a son . and thus we established joseph in the land  and that we might teach him the interpretation of sayings . and allah has full control over his affair  but most people do not know . 22 and when he attained his maturity  we gave him wisdom and knowledge . and thus do we reward the doers of good . 23 and she in whose house he was  sought to seduce him  and bolted the doors and said  come . he said  allah forbid  surely my lord made good my abode . the wrongdoers never prosper . 24 and certainly she desired him  and he would have desired her if he had not seen the clear evidence of his lord . thus  it was  that we a  15  the essential difference between the version of this story given in the bible and the version in the quran is that while the bible narrates it as a simple story  the quran preserves in it the spiritual element . b  18  the quran represents jacob as doubting from the very first the sincerity of joseph s brothers  but not so the bible . again  according to the quran  joseph relates his vision to his father  who is at once apprehensive of the envy of his brothers  if they are apprised of it  but according to the bible  jacob himself rebuked joseph for his dream . besides several discrepancies  the bible narrative represents jacob as an ordinary man  while the quran represents him as a prophet . 12  25 â€¢ joseph is imprisoned 289 might turn away from him evil and indecency . surely he was one of our chosen servants .  25 and they raced with one another to the door  and she tore his shirt from behind  and they met her husband at the door . she said  what is the penalty for one who intends evil to jour wife  except imprisonment or a painful punishment  26 he said  she sought to seduce me . and a witness of her own family bore wit ness  if his shirt is torn in front  she speaks the truth and he is a liar . 27 and if his shirt is torn from behind  she tells a lie and he is truthful . 28 so when he saw his shirt torn from behind  he said  surely it is an intrigue of you women . your intrigue is indeed great  29 joseph  turn aside from this . and  my wife   ask forgiveness for your sin . surely you are one of the sinful . section 4  joseph is imprisoned 30 and women in the city said  the chief s wife seeks to seduce her slave . he has indeed affected her deeply with  his  love . truly we see her in clear error . 31 so when she heard of their scheming  c she sent for them and prepared for them a feast  and gave each of them a knife  and said  to joseph   come out to them . so when they saw him  they thought him great  and cut their hands  in amazement   and said  holy allah  this is not a mortal  this is but a noble angel . 32 she said  this is he about whom you blamed me . and certainly i sought to seduce him  but he was firm in self a  24  this does not show that joseph had any desire for her  but that the temptation was so strong that  if he had not been strengthened by great faith in god  he would have fallen a prey to mortal weakness . b  28  the vindication of joseph s character on this occasion  and the pro duction of the evidence of the shirt  are not related in the bible . the next section proves that joseph was not cast into prison for being guilty of having committed an outrage against his master s wife . c  311  some think that she knew that certain women had circulated the news with the object of getting a chance to see joseph . rf  312  the egyptians were a superstitious and polytheistic people  and anything strange  or any human being about whom they witnessed anything won derful  was considered by them to be a god . 290 12 . joseph â€¢ 12  33 restraint . and if he does not do what i order him  he shall certainly be imprisoned  and he shall certainly be degraded . 33 he said  my lord  the prison is dearer to me than that to which they invite me . and if you do not turn away their intrigue from me  i shall yearn towards them and be one of the ignorant . 34 so his lord accepted his prayer and turned away their intrigue from him . surely he is the hearer  the knower . 35 then it occurred to them after they had seen the signs that they should imprison him for a while .  section 5  joseph s preaching in prison 36 and two youths entered the prison with him . one of them said  i saw myself pressing wine . and the other said  i saw myself carrying bread on my head  from which birds were eating . inform us of its interpretation  surely we see you to be from among the doers of good .  37 he said  the food with which you are fed shall not come to you  but i shall inform you of its interpretation before it comes to you . this is from what my lord has taught me . surely i have forsaken the religion of a people who do not believe in allah  and are deniers of the hereafter . 38 and i follow the religion of my fathers  abraham and isaac and jacob . it does not befit us to set up any partner with allah . this is by allah s grace upon us and on mankind  but most people do not give thanks . 39 my two fellow prisoners  are various lords better or allah the one  the supreme  40 you do not serve besides him but names which you have named  you and your fathers â€ ” allah has sent down no authority for them . judgment is only allah s . he has commanded that you a  35  there is nothing to show that joseph was cast into prison on a charge of having committed an outrage on that woman . as he was proved guiltless of that charge  it is very likely that some other accusation was brought against him  and more probably an autocratic ruler needed no excuse for putting an innocent man into prison . by signs must be understood the signs of joseph s innocence . b  36  compare genesis  ch . 40  which  however  omits joseph s preaching . the two youths were the butler and the baker . 1241  the king s vision interpreted by joseph 291 serve none but him . this is the right religion  but most people do not know . 41 my two fellowprisoners  as for one of you  he will serve wine for his lord to drink  and as for the other  he will be cruci fied  so that birds will eat from his head . the matter is decreed concerning which you inquired . 42 and he said to him whom he knew would be delivered of the two  remember me with your lord . but the devil caused him to forget mentioning  it  to his lord  so he remained in the prison a few years . section 6  the king s vision interpreted by joseph 43 and the king said  i have seen seven fat cows which seven lean ones devoured  and seven green ears and  seven  others dry . chiefs  explain to me my dream  if you can interpret the dream . 44 they said  confused dreams  and we do not know the interpre tation of dreams . 45 and of the two  he who had found deliverance and remembered after a long time said  i will inform you of its interpretation  so send me . 46 joseph  truthful one  explain to us seven fat cows which seven lean ones devoured  and seven green ears and  seven  others dry  that i may go back to the people so that they may know . 47 he said  you shall sow for seven years as usual  then what you reap  leave it in its ear  except a little which you eat . 48 then after that will come seven years of hardship  which will eat away all you have beforehand stored for them  except a little which you have preserved . 49 then after that will come a year in which people will have rain and in which they will press  grapes  . section 7  joseph cleared of the charges 50 and the king said  bring him to me . so when the messen ger came to him  he said  go back to your lord and ask him  what is the case of the women who cut their hands  surely my lord knows their intrigue . 51  the king  said  what was your business when you sought to seduce joseph  they said  holy allah  we knew of no evil on his part . the chief s wife said  now has the truth come out . i sought to seduce him and he is surely truthful .  1 292 12 . joseph â€¢ 12  52 52  joseph said   this is that he might know that i have not been unfaithful to him in secret  and that allah does not guide the plan of the unfaithful .  53 and i do not call myself sinless  surely  man s  self is apt to command evil  except those on whom my lord has mercy . surely my lord is forgiving  merciful . 54 and the king said  bring him to me  i will choose him for myself . so when he talked with him  he said  surely you are in our presence today dignified  trusted . 55 he said  place me  in autho rity  over the treasures of the land  surely i am a good keeper  knowing well . 56 and thus did we give to joseph power in the land â€ ” he had mastery in it wherever he liked . we bestow our mercy on whom we please  and we do not waste the reward of the doers of good . 57 and certainly the reward of the hereafter is better for those who believe and guard against evil . section 8  joseph helps his brothers 58 and joseph s brothers came and went in to  see  him  and he knew them  while they did not recognize him . s9 and when he furnished them with their provision  he said  bring me a brother of yours from your father . do you not see that i give full measure and that i am the best of hosts  60 but if you do not bring him to me  you shall have no measure  of corn  from me  nor shall you come near me . 61 they said  we shall try to make his father yield about him  and we are sure to do  it  . 62 and he said to his servants  put their money into their bags that they may recognize it when they go back to their family  so that they may come back . a  52  these are the words of joseph  who explains his conduct in preferring to remain in prison until his innocence was established . b  53  when a man addressed jesus as good master  he said   why do you call me good  no one is good but one  that is  god   mark 1018  . the righteous never attribute any good to themselves  but attribute all good to the great source of goodness â€ ” god . man s self is here called ammarah  i.e . one apt to command evil . it is the lowest stage in spiritual growth . see also 752 and 8930 . 12  63 â€¢ joseph helps his brothers 293 63 so when they returned to their father  they said  our father  the measure is withheld from us  so send with us our brother that we may get the measure  and we will surely guard him . 64 he said  can i trust you with him  except as i trusted you with his brother before  so allah is the best keeper  and he is the most merciful of those who show mercy . 65 and when they opened their goods  they found their money returned to them . they said  our father  what  more  can we desire  this is our property returned to us  and we shall bring corn for our family and guard our brother  and have in addition the measure of a camelload . this is an easy measure . 66 he said  i will by no means send him with you  until you give me a firm promise in allah s name that you will bring him back to me  unless you are completely surrounded . and when they gave him their promise  he said  allah is guardian over what we say . 67 and he said  my sons  do not enter by one gate but enter by different gates .  and i can not avail you against  the decree of  allah at all . judgment is only allah s . on him i rely  and on him let the reliant rely . 68 and when they entered as their father had instructed them  it did not avail them against allah at all  but  it was only  a desire in the soul of jacob  which he satisfied . and surely he was possessed of knowledge  because we had given him knowledge  but most people do not know . section 9  the youngest brother 69 and when they came to joseph  he lodged his brother with himself  saying  i am jour brother  so do not grieve at what they do . 70 then when he furnished them with their provision   someone  a  67  jacob  it seems  had come to know by divine revelation that joseph was there  and therefore he ordered them to enter by different gates so that joseph might find his brother . the next verse makes it clear when it says  and surely he was possessed of knowledge because we had given him knowledge . b  68  the bible narrative represents jacob as being quite ignorant in the matter . 294 12 . joseph â€¢ 12  71 placed the drinkingcup in his brother s bag . a then a crier cried out  o caravan  you are surely thieves  71 they said  turning towards them  what is it that you miss  72 they said  we miss the king s drinkingcup  and he who brings it shall have a camelload  and i am responsible for it . 73 they said  by allah  you know for certain that we have not come to make mischief in the land  and we are not thieves . 74 they said  but what is the penalty for this  if you are liars  75 they said  the penalty for this â€ ” the person in whose bag it is found  he himself is the penalty for it . thus do we punish the wrongdoers . 76 so he began with their sacks before the sack of his brother  then he brought it out from his brother s sack . thus did we plan for the sake of joseph . he could not take his brother under the king s law  unless allah pleased . e we raise in degree whom we please . and above everyone possessed of knowledge is the all knowing one . 77 they said  if he steal  a brother of his did indeed steal before . but joseph kept it secret in his mind  and did not a  701  though the bible narrative ascribes the placing of the cup to joseph  the quran does not say so . it may have been one of joseph s own brothers who did this act so that benjamin might also be removed from jacob  who loved him most after joseph . there is a clear hint to this possibility in v. 77  where joseph accuses them of having done some guilty deed   you are in an evil condition   and a still clearer hint in v. 89  where joseph says   do you know how you treated joseph and his brother  when you were ignorant   b  702  it is a mistake to suppose that the crier was the very person who had placed the cup there . as v. 72 makes it clear  it was the king s drinkingcup  in other words it was not joseph s personal property  but the property of the king  or government property . it is clear that the men who provided corn were different from those who had charge of the king s property . c  76  this makes it clear that this was not joseph s plan  but a divine plan . in other words  the circumstances were made to assist joseph to keep his brother with him . joseph s desire  no doubt  was to retain his brother benjamin while the others returned  but he was unable to do so under the laws of egypt  as stated here . this shows that one living under an alien government should abide by the laws of that government . d  77  the brothers of joseph made a false statement against joseph to cast a veil over their own evil deeds . if benjamin  they said  was a thief  so was his brother joseph  as if they meant to say that this evil trait of character was due to the mother  rachel  probably referring to the incident in genesis  3119  . 12  78 â€¢ joseph discloses his identity 295 disclose it to them . he said  you are in an evil condition  and allah knows best what you state . 78 they said  o chief  he has a father  a very old man  so take one of us in his place . surely we see you to be one of the doers of good . 79 he said  allah forbid that we should seize other than him with whom we found our property  for then surely we should be unjust  section 10  joseph discloses his identity 80 so when they despaired of  persuading  him  they conferred together privately . the eldest of them said  do you not know that your father took from you a promise in allah s name  and how you fell short of your duty about joseph before  so i shall not leave this land  until my father permits me or allah decides for me  and he is the best of the judges . 81 go back to your father and say  our father  jour son committed theft . and we bear witness only to what we know  and we could not keep watch over the unseen . 82 and ask the town where we were  and the caravan with which we proceeded . and surely we are truthful . 83  jacob  said  no  your souls have contrived an affair for you  so patience is best . maybe allah will bring them together to me . surely he is the knowing  the wise . 84 and he turned away from them  and said  my sorrow for joseph  and his eyes were filled   with tears  on account of the grief  then he repressed  grief  . 85 they said  by allah  fou will not cease remembering joseph till you are a prey to disease or you perish . 86 he said  i complain of my grief and sorrow only to allah  and i know from allah what you do not know .  87 my sons  go and inquire about joseph and his brother  and do not despair of allah s mercy . c a  84  the word used can carry the meaning of being filled . even if we accept the ordinary significance  his eyes were whitened  the meaning is that they were whitened with tears  which naturally came at the mention of joseph . b  86  this shows clearly that jacob knew by divine revelation that joseph was alive . c  87  here the quran again differs from the bible and shows that jacob was so certain of joseph being alive because of the knowledge he received from god  that he sent his sons a third time to egypt to ascertain about joseph . it appears that he had an inkling also that joseph was in egypt . 296 12 . joseph â€¢ 12  88 surely none despairs of allah s mercy except the disbelieving people . 88 so when they came to him  they said  o chief  distress has afflicted us and our family  and we have brought little money  so give us full measure and be charitable to us . surely allah rewards the charitable . 89 he said  do you know how you treated joseph and his brother  when you were ignorant  90 they said  are you indeed joseph  he said  i am joseph and this is my brother  allah has indeed been gracious to us . surely he who keeps his duty and is patient â€ ” allah never wastes the reward of the doers of good . 91 they said  by allah  allah has indeed chosen you over us  and we were certainly sinners . 92 he said  there is no reproach against you this day . a allah may forgive you  and he is the most merciful of those who show mercy . 93 take this shirt of mine and cast it before my father s face â€ ” he will come to know . and bring to me all your family . section 1 1  jacob goes to egypt 94 and when the caravan left  egypt   their father said  surely i scent  the power of  joseph  if you do not call me weak of mind . c 95 they said  by allah  you are surely in your old error . 96 then when the bearer of good news came  he cast it before a  92  it is related that the holy prophet took hold of the two sides of the gate of the kabah on the day of the conquest of makkah and said to the quraish  how do you think i should treat you  they said  we hope for good  a noble brother and the son of a noble brother . then he said  i say as my brother joseph said   there is no reproach against you this day  . b  93  the quran does not say anywhere that jacob had become blind . the shirt was sent as being a reminder of the torn shirt of joseph  which joseph s brothers had brought to jacob  v. 18  . c  94  when the caravan in which were joseph s brothers departed from egypt  jacob again received assurance from on high about joseph  so he said to those around him that he scented the power of joseph . jacob knew that joseph was alive and of this he informed his sons again and again  but he now told them further that he had received an assurance from god that joseph occupied a high position . 12  97 â€¢ jacob goes to egypt 297 his face so he became certain . he said  did i not say to you that i know from allah what you do not know  97 they said  our father  ask forgiveness of our sins for us  surely we are sinners . 98 he said  i shall ask forgiveness for you of my lord . surely he is the for giving  the merciful . 99 then when they came to joseph  he lodged his parents with himself and said  enter egypt in safety  if allah please . 100 and he raised his parents on the throne   and they fell prostrate for his sake . and he said  my father  this is the significance of my earlier vision â€ ” my lord has made it true . and he was indeed kind to me  when he brought me forth from the prison  and brought you from the desert after the devil had sown dissensions between me and my brothers . surely my lord is benignant to whom he pleases . truly he is the knowing  the wise . 101 my lord  you have given me kingdom and taught me something of the inter pretation of sayings . originator of the heavens and the earth  you are my friend in this world and the hereafter . make me die in submission and join me with the righteous . 102 this is from the announcements relating to the unseen  which  we reveal to you  and you were not with them when they resolved upon their affair  and they were devising plans . e 103 and most people do not believe  though you desire it eagerly . 104 and you ask them no reward for it . it is nothing but a reminder for the nations . a  1001  the meaning may be that he placed them in a good position . b  1002  seeing the highly dignified position to which joseph had been raised in egypt  they all fell prostrate before god as a mark of thanksgiving . c  102  throughout the quran the  announcements relating to the unseen   as here  signify not the ancient histories of past prophets  but a repetition of those histories in the life of the holy prophet muhammad . thus from this verse onwards the subject is changed to the holy prophet s opponents . the reference in  when they resolved upon their affair  and they were devising plans  is to the resolution of the quraish and their plans against the prophet  for which see 830 . the quran does not relate stories for the sake of giving information of the past  but for the lessons which they afford for the future guidance of man . 298 12 . joseph â€¢ 12  105 section 12  a lesson for the prophet s opponents 105 and how many a sign in the heavens and the earth do they pass by  yet they turn away from it  106 and most of them do not believe in allah without setting up partners  with him  . 107 do they then feel secure from the coming to them of an allencompass ing punishment from allah or from the coming to them of the hour suddenly  while they do not perceive  108 say  this is my way  i call to allah  with certain know ledge â€ ” i and those who follow me . and glory be to allah  and i am not of those who set up partners  with allah  . 109 and we did not send before you any but men  from the people of the towns  to whom we sent revelation . have they not then travelled in the land and seen what was the end of those before them  and certainly the abode of the hereafter is best for those who keep their duty . do you not then understand  110 until  when the messengers des paired and  the people  thought that they were told a lie   our help came to them  and whom we pleased was delivered . and our punishment is not averted from the guilty people . m in their histories there is certainly a lesson for those who have understanding . it is not a narrative which could be forged  but a verification of what is before it  and a distinct explanation of all things  and a guide and a mercy to a people who believe . a  110   they  refers to the people  not messengers . the messengers warn their people  but the latter are so stubborn that the messengers at length despair of their people . the people  on the other hand  think that what the prophets had told them about the coming of the punishment was a lie . then it is that the promised help for the prophets comes and the punishment with which the evildoers are threatened overtakes them . that the prophets never despair of divine assistance coming to them  in accordance with divine promise  is clear from what has already been said in v. 87  see also 1556 and 2923  . chapter 13 aira d thunder this chapter is named thunder from the analogy of rain which is often likened to revelation in the quran . as rain is accompanied by thunder and lightening  so is revelation accompanied by warning of punishment  although its real purpose is mercy . the chapter points to signs in physical nature to the truth of revelation and deals with the demand from the disbelievers to see the sign of punishment befalling them . it then tells them about the divine laws which govern reward and punishment  and explains that the real miracles were the spiritual life that the quran awakened in people and the transformation it would bring in the world despite facing great mountains of obstacles . this chapter was revealed during the last four years of the period of the holy prophet s life at makkah . section 1  truth of revelation in the name of allah  the beneficent  the merciful . 1 i  allah  am the best knower  the seer .  these are verses of the book . and what is revealed to you from your lord is the truth  but most people do not believe . 2 allah is he who raised the heavens without any pillars that you can see  and he is established on the throne of power  and he made the sun and the moon subservient  to you  . each one runs to an appointed term . he regulates the affair  making clear the messages that you may be certain of the meeting with your lord . 3 and he it is who spread the earth  and made in it firm mountains and rivers . and of all fruits he has made in it pairs  a  1  the original arabic consists of the letters alif  lam  mim and ra . these stand for ana  i   allah  a lam  best knower  and rai   seer  respectively . b  2  all heavenly bodies are raised high without any pillars that man can see . those pillars are the laws of gravitation . all heavenly bodies  we are further told  run their course to an appointed term  they have a beginning and an end  as all things on earth have a beginning and an end . 299 300 13 . thunder â€¢ 13  4 two  of every kind  . he makes the night cover the day . surely there are signs in this for a people who reflect . 4 and in the earth are tracts side by side  and gardens of vines  and corn  and palm trees growing from one root and distinct roots â€ ” they are watered with one water  and we make some of them to excel others in fruit . surely there are signs in this for a people who understand .  5 and if you wonder  then wondrous is their saying  when we are dust  shall we then be raised in a new creation  these are they who disbelieve in their lord  and these have chains on their necks   and they are the companions of the fire  in it they will abide . 6 and they ask you to hasten on the evil before the good  and indeed there have been exemplary punishments before them . and surely your lord is full of forgiveness for mankind despite their wrongdoing . and surely your lord is severe in retribution . 7 and those who disbelieve say  why has not a sign been sent down to him from his lord  fou are only a warner and for every people a guide . section 2  fall and rise of nations 8 allah knows what every female bears  and what the wombs a  4  unity in diversity is observable in the whole of nature  which is a sure sign of the unity of the great author of all existence . besides this  as there is a difference in the produce of different tracts  though they are subject to the same laws of nature  even so are the hearts of people in relation to the growth of the seed of virtue  which is sown by revelation . b  5  the chains spoken of here are the chains which keep them constrained to evil usages and corrupt practices . c  6  the opponents of the holy prophet are told that the merciful god would deal with them not according to their wrongdoings  but according to his vast and comprehensive forgiveness . but when evil outsteps all bounds  his very mercy  which must be exercised towards his righteous servants  requires that the wrong doers should not be left without punishment . d  7  the words for every people a guide refer to the holy prophet . he was a warner indeed  he warned the evildoers of the evil consequences of their evil deeds  but he was ultimately to be a guide for every people  to lead them out of their evil ways and to set them on the right path . 139  fall and rise of nations 301 fall short of completing and what they grow .  and everything with him has a measure . 9 the knower of the unseen and the seen  the great  the most high . 10 alike  to him  among you is he who conceals the word and he who speaks openly  and he who hides himself by night and  who  goes forth by day .  n for him are  angels  guarding the consequences  of his deeds   before him and behind him  who guard him by allah s command surely allah does not change the condition of a people  until they change their own condition . and when allah intends harm to a people  there is no averting it  and besides him they have no protector . 12 he it is who shows you lightning causing fear and hope and  who  brings up the heavy cloud . 13 and thunder celebrates his praise  and the angels too for awe of him . and he sends thunderbolts and strikes with them whom he pleases  yet they dispute concerning allah  and he is mighty in prowess . 14 to him is due the true prayer . and those to whom they pray besides him give them no answer  but  they are  like one who stretches forth his two hands towards water that it may reach his mouth  but it will not reach it . and the prayer of the disbelie vers is only wasted . 15 and whoever is in the heavens and the earth makes submission to allah only  willingly and unwillingly  and their shadows  too  morning and evening . 16 say  who is the lord of the heavens and the earth  say  allah . say  do you then take besides him  guardians who control a  8  the physical law of nature is spoken of here with a deeper reference to the spiritual law  according to which some receive a new birth through the prophet and others do not . the subject is made clearer in the verses that follow . b  10  a general law is given expression to here  with a deeper reference to the secret and open counsels against the holy prophet and to enemies seeking his life by day and by night . c  11  while the statement is no doubt general and refers to the guardian angels referred to in 661  there is a deeper allusion to the divine protection specially granted to the holy prophet against the numerous enemies among whom he lived day and night . the angels guard the consequences of the deeds of man  and are therefore spoken of here as guarding him  i.e.  guarding whatever he does  by allah s command . 302 13 . thunder â€¢ 13  17 no benefit or harm even for themselves  say  are the blind and the seeing alike  or  are darkness and light equal  or  have they set up with allah partners who have created creation like his  so that what is created became confused to them  say  allah is the creator of all things  and he is the one  the supreme . 17 he sends down water from the clouds  then watercourses flow according to their measure  and the torrent bears along the swelling foam . and a scum like it arises from what they melt in the fire for the sake of making ornaments or tools .  thus does allah compare truth and falsehood . then as for the scum  it passes away as a worthless thing  and as for that which benefits people  it remains behind in the earth . thus does allah set forth parables . 18 for those who respond to their lord is good . and as for those who do not respond to him  even if they had all that is in the earth and as much again  they would certainly offer it for a ransom . as for those  theirs is an evil reckoning and their abode is hell  and evil is the restingplace . section 3  good and evil bring their own reward 19 is he who knows that what is revealed to you from your lord is the truth  like him who is blind  only those who have understanding are mindful â€ ” 20 those who fulfil the pact of allah  and do not break the covenant  21 and those who join what allah has ordered to be joined c and have awe of their lord  and fear the evil reckoning . 22 and those who are steadfast seeking the pleasure a  171  the word used includes here all kinds of things necessary for the life of man  such as utensils  tools  implements  and instruments of war . b  172  the parable set forth here signifies that the holy prophet and his followers will live and prosper  as they work for the good of mankind . on the other hand  evil practices and worthless usages and customs  as well as those who uphold them  will be swept away before the mighty current of truth  as rubbish is borne away by a torrent . c  21  while the previous verse deals with people s duty to their maker  this refers to relations with his creatures .  what allah has ordered to be joined  includes all those ties of love and relationship which allah has taught human beings to observe and keep inviolate . 1323  good and evil bring their own reward 303 of their lord  and keep up prayer and spend  on good works  out of what we have given them  secretly and openly  and repel evil with good  a theirs is the  happy  issue of the abode â€ ” 23 gardens of perpetuity  which they will enter along with those who do good from among their fathers and their spouses and their offspring  and the angels will enter in upon them from every gate . 24 peace be on you  because you were constant â€ ” how excellent is then the final abode  25 and those who break the covenant of allah after its con firmation  and cut apart what allah has ordered to be joined  and make mischief in the land  for them is the curse  and theirs is the evil end of the abode . 26 allah amplifies provision for whom he pleases  and restricts  it also  . and they rejoice in this world s life . and this world s life  compared with the hereafter  is only a temporary enjoyment . section 4  revolution to be brought about by the quran 27 and those who disbelieve say  why is not a sign sent down to him by his lord  c say  allah leaves in error whom he a  22  evil is a thing which is by all means to be repelled  and hence good for evil is recommended only in cases when evil would be repelled by that good . unconditionally requiting evil with good would abolish all safeguards  evildoers who received nothing but good for every evil they committed would most assuredly establish a condition of anarchy by their evil deeds . elsewhere it is said  whoever forgives and brings about reform  4240  . b  23  the quran is full of clear statements that women shall enjoy the bliss of paradise . azwaj is the plural oizauj  which means either husband or wife  and hence i have rendered it as spouses . c  271  the answer to this question is given at the end of this section   disaster will not cease to afflict them because of what they do  or it will reach close to their homes  until the promise of allah come to pass   v. 31  . this promise related to the utter annihilation of the power of the disbelievers . the question  why is not a sign sent down to him  here as elsewhere in the quran  is a demand for the promised annihilation of their power and their defeat  and the answer is always conveyed in somewhat similar terms  stating first that they should ask for mercy  that the quran has healing power  the condition of the faithful being a witness to it  that the fate of the former generations affords a lesson  that smaller calamities continue to afflict them  and in these they can see the signs of their 304 13 . thunder â€¢ 13  28 pleases  and guides to himself those who turn  to him   â€ ” 28 those who believe and whose hearts find rest in the remembrance of allah . now surely in allah s remembrance do hearts find rest . 29 those who believe and do good  a good final state is theirs and a goodly return . 30 thus we have sent you among a nation before which other nations have passed away  that you might recite to them what we have revealed to you  and  still  they deny the beneficent . say  he is my lord  there is no god but he  in him do i trust and to him is my return . 31 and if there could be a quran with which the mountains were made to pass away  or the earth were split apart  or the dead were made to speak â€ ” indeed  the commandment is wholly allah s . do not those who believe know that  if allah please  he would certainly guide all the people  and as for those who disbelieve  disaster will not cease to afflict them because of what they do  or it will reach close to their homes  until the promise of allah come to pass . surely allah will not fail in  his  promise . ultimate vanquishment  and that finally  if all those tokens are rejected  the great calamity will not fail to overtake them . a  272  the contrast with those who turn to god makes it clear that allah s pleasure to leave some in error is exercised only in the case of those who  though invited to god  do not turn to him but choose to remain in error . the first part may also be translated thus  allah leaves in error who will  remain in error  . b  31  that the quran should work such great wonders is not an impossi bility but a fact  for we are immediately told that it will be brought about soon by allah s commandment . at the time when these verses were revealed  difficulties in the spread of islam appeared like mountains . it is a matter of history that they were made to pass away . the earth splitting apart means that the quran would go deep down into the hearts of people  which are compared here to the earth . these words may also mean that the earth will be travelled over . there were no facilities at that time for going to distant corners of arabia  to say nothing of the whole world . yet not only was the whole of arabia travelled over by the message bearers of islam within ten years after this  but within a hundred years of the prophet s death islam had traversed the whole of the known world  from the farthest east in china to the farthest west in spain . it is again a matter of history that the dead were made to speak . people who were dead spiritually now spoke with such power that the whole earth from end to end responded to their call . 13  32 â€¢ opposition will fail 305 section 5  opposition will fail 32 and messengers before you were certainly mocked  but i gave respite to those who disbelieved  then i seized them . how  terrible  was then my retribution  33 is  then  he who watches every soul as to what it earns  like their associate gods   and yet they ascribe partners to allah  say  name them . a would you inform him of what he does not know in the earth  or of an out ward saying   rather  their plan is made to seem good to those who disbelieve  and they are kept back from the path . e and whom allah leaves in error  he has no guide . 34 for them is punishment in this world s life  and the punishment of the hereafter is certainly more grievous . and they have no protector against allah . 35 a parable of the garden which is promised to those who keep their duty  in it flow rivers . its fruits are perpetual and  so is  its plenty . such is the end for those who keep their duty  and the end for the disbelievers is the fire . 36 and those to whom we have given the book rejoice in what has been revealed to you  e and some sects deny a part of it . say  i am commanded only to serve allah and not set up partners with him . to him do i invite  you   and to him is my return . 37 and thus have we revealed it  a a  331  it is to show the utmost contempt for the alleged partners of the divine being that their worshippers are called upon to give them a name  as if it were said that they are not worthy of a name . or the meaning may be  give them a name expressing any qualification of godhead  such as a sustainer  creator  etc . b  332  he knows both the inner feelings of man and his outward sayings  and he does not stand in need of a mediator . c  333  as stated in 2938  it is the devil who makes their evil deeds seem good to people and keeps them back from the right path . rf  35  the paradise mentioned here is called a. parable  as also in 4715 . a saying of the holy prophet makes it clear that the blessings of paradise are such as no eye has seen  nor has ear heard  nor has it entered into the heart of man to conceive of them  bukhari  598  . the description given in the quran is only a likeness of what it actually is  as it is of a nature entirely different from the things of this world . e  36  the book may signify the quran  or it may refer to the previous revelation  in which case the jewish and christian converts to islam are meant here . 306 13 . thunder â€¢ 13  38 true judgment  in arabic . and if you follow their low desires after the knowledge that has come to you  you would have against allah no guardian nor protector . section 6  steady progress of truth 38 and certainly we sent messengers before you and appoin ted for them wives and children . and it is not in the power of a messenger to bring a sign except by allah s permission . for every term there is an appointment . 39 allah effaces what he pleases and establishes  what he pleases   and with him is the basis of the book .  40 whether we show you part of what we promise them  or cause you to die  before it comes about   your duty is only to deliver the message  and ours to call  them  to account . 41 do they not see that we are visiting the land  curtailing it of its sides   and allah pronounces a doom â€ ” there is no repeller of his decree . and he is swift in calling to account . 42 and those before them planned indeed  but all planning is allah  s. c he knows what every soul earns . and the disbelievers will come to know for whom is the  good  end of the abode . 43 and those who disbelieve say  7ou are not a messenger . say  allah is sufficient for a witness between me and you and whoever has knowledge of the book . a  39  the divine ordinance to annihilate the power of the opponents of the holy prophet and to bring about the establishment of the truth is called the  basis of the book   umm alkitab   because the final defeat of the powers of evil  which was previously foretold  would be such a clear sign that it would dispel all doubts . b  41  the reference in curtailing the sides may be either to some of the exalted men having come over to islam and the opposition being thus weakened  or to the diminution of the number of disbelievers  both high and low  by people daily leaving their ranks and joining the ranks of islam . c  42  the meaning is that the plans of the enemy need not be feared  for all their planning is controlled by allah  or that the requital of their plans is in the hands of allah . d  43  those who have any knowledge of previous revelation will testify to the truth of the revelation of the quran  because it fulfils all previous prophecies and satisfies the criteria of a true revelation . chapter 14 ibrahim abraham this chapter is named after abraham  whose prayer is mentioned in verses 35 â€ ” 41 . it explains that the work of the quran is to lead people out of darkness into light  but that previous prophets too  such as moses  had their message rejected at first . however  in all cases the opposition failed and god s promise to help the prophet was fulfilled . truth is confirmed and man brings about his own ruin by rejecting it . then abraham s prayer for the right guidance of his descendants is mentioned and we are told that opposition to the truth will always end in failure . this chapter was revealed during the last four years of the period of the holy prophet s life at makkah . section 1  revelation dispels darkness in the name of allah  the beneficent  the merciful . 1 i  allah  am the seer . a book which we have revealed to you that you may bring forth people  by their lord s permission  from darkness into light  to the way of the mighty  the praised one  2 of allah  whose is whatever is in the heavens and whatever is in the earth . and woe to the disbelievers for the severe punish ment  3 those who love this world s life more than the hereafter  and turn away from allah s path  and would have it crooked . those are far astray . 4 and we sent no messenger but with the language of his people  so that he might explain to them clearly then allah leaves in error whom he pleases and he guides whom he pleases . and he is the mighty  the wise . 5 and certainly we sent moses with our messages  saying  a  4  nothing is said here about the extent of the mission of the holy prophet  which was for all mankind  see 7158 . all that is said here is that every prophet is sent with the language of his people so that he may explain to his people  because it is his people who are the first recipients of his message . 307 308 14 . abraham â€¢ 14  6 bring forth jour people from darkness into light and remind them of the days of allah .  in this are surely signs for every steadfast  grateful one . 6 and when moses said to his people  call to mind allah s favour to you  when he delivered you from pharaoh s people  who subjected you to severe torment  and slaughtered your sons and spared your women . and there was a great trial in it from your lord . section 2  truth is rejected first 7 and when your lord made it known  if you are grateful  i will give you more  and if you are ungrateful  my punishment is truly severe . 8 and moses said  if you are ungrateful  you and all those on earth  then allah is surely selfsufficient  praised . 9 has not the account reached you of those before you  of the people of noah and ad and thamud â€ ” and those after them  none knows them but allah . their messengers came to them with clear arguments  but they thrust their hands into their mouths e and said  we deny what you are sent with  and surely we are in serious doubt about that to which you invite us . 10 their messen gers said  is there doubt about allah  the maker of the heavens and the earth  he invites you to forgive you your faults and to give you respite till an appointed term . they said  you are nothing but mortals like us  you wish to turn us away from what our fathers used to worship  so bring us clear authority . a  5   the days of allah  signify his merciful dealings with the righteous and his punishment of the wicked . b  91  the quran does not claim to give a history of all the prophets  see 4164 and 4078 . the statement made here is much wider . it is claimed that no other book mentions them all  they are known only to allah . c  92  this expression may mean their inability to give an answer  or that they bit their hands by reason of rage  or that they put their hands into the mouths of the messengers to silence them . d  93  the general statements made with regard to the messengers and the treatment of their people  in this and the following section  are particularly made in reference to the mission of the prophet muhammad  the opposition and enmity of his people  their turning him out of the city  and their final discomfiture . 1411 opposition is at last destroyed 309 11 their messengers said to them  we are nothing but mortals like yourselves  but allah bestows  his  favours on whom he pleases of his servants . and it is not for us to bring you an autho rity  except by allah s permission . and on allah let the believers rely . 12 and why should we not rely on allah and he has indeed guided us in our ways  and we would certainly bear with patience your persecution of us . and on allah should the reliant rely . section 3  opposition is at last destroyed 13 and those who disbelieved said to their messengers  we will certainly drive you out of our land  unless you come back into our religion .  so their lord revealed to them  we shall certainly destroy the wrongdoers  14 and we shall certainly settle you in the land after them . this is for him who fears standing in my presence and fears my threat . 15 and they sought judgment  and every insolent opposer was disappointed  16 hell is before him and he is given to drink boiling water  17 he drinks it little by little and is not able to swallow it  and death comes to him from every quarter  yet he does not die . c and before him is vehement punishment . 18 the parable of those who disbelieve in their lord  their works are as ashes on which the wind blows hard on a stormy day . they have no power over anything they have earned . that is straying far away . 19 do you not see that allah created the heavens and the earth with truth  if he please  he will take you away and bring a new creation  20 and that is not difficult for allah . 21 and they will all come forth to allah  then the weak will say to those who were proud  we were your followers  can you then avert from a  13  this is no doubt equally a description of what the holy prophet was suffering at the hands of his enemies . b  14  this verse contains a very clear prophecy of the flight of the holy prophet from makkah and of his reentry into that city as a conqueror and ruler . c  17  he experiences  as it were  the pangs of death  but death  which would end all distress  does not come to him . d  20  v. 1 8 states that all the exertions of the opponents against the prophet will be useless  while verses 19 and 20 warn the disbelievers that their power will come to an end and another people will take their place . 310 14 . abraham 1422 us any of the punishment of allah  they will say  if allah had guided us  we would have guided you . it is the same to us whether we cry or bear patiently  there is no escape for us . section 4  truth is confirmed 22 and the devil will say  a when the matter is decided  surely allah promised you a promise of truth  and i promised you  then failed you . and i had no authority over you  except that i called you and you obeyed me  so do not blame me but blame your selves . i can not come to your help  nor can you come to my help . i deny your taking me as partner with allah before . e surely for the unjust is a painful punishment . 23 and those who believe and do good are made to enter gardens  in which rivers flow  abiding in them by their lord s permission . their greeting therein is  peace  24 do you not see how allah sets forth a parable of a good word as a good tree  whose root is firm and whose branches are high   yielding its fruit in a  221  the devil mentioned in this verse is none other than the proud mis leader of the preceding one . compare also 3730  where the very words we had no authority over you are put into the mouth of the leaders of evil from among man kind . b  222  whenever a person is misled into an evil deed  he finds in the end that the promise of a good consequence for an evil deed was only a deception . compare 4120 and 1764. c  223  an alternative meaning  is  disbelieved because you took me as partner with allah . in other words  the leaders disbelieve because their followers make them think by their flattery that they are worthy of being obeyed and followed . d  24  the parable likening a good word to a good tree follows immediately a description of the final abode of those who do good â€ ” gardens in which rivers flow . a good word is like a good tree which gives its fruit in every season  and therefore the fruits which a man will find in paradise are only the fruits of his own good deeds . the trees of paradise are in fact man s own good deeds  which have grown into trees  bearing a fruit which is an embodiment of the spiritual fruits of the good deeds of this life . as good deeds are likened to fruitbearing trees  faith is likened to water repeatedly in the quran  being the source of physical life . it is for this reason that  just as the righteous are always spoken of as being those who believe and do good  paradise is always described as being a garden in which 14  26 â€¢ man s injustice in rejecting truth 3 1 1 every season by the permission of its lord  and allah sets forth parables for people that they may be mindful . 26 and the parable of an evil word is as an evil tree pulled up from the earth s surface  it has no stability .  27 auah confirms those who believe with the sure word in this world s life and in the hereafter  and allah leaves the wrongdoers in error  and allah does what he pleases . section 5  man s injustice in rejecting truth 28 do you not see those who change allah s favour for dis belief e and make their people reach the abode of destruction â€ ” 29 hell . they will burn in it . and an evil place it is to settle in  30 and they set up equals with allah to lead astray from his path . say  enjoy yourselves  for surely your return is to the fire . 31 tell my servants who believe to keep up prayer and spend  on good works  out of what we have given them  secretly and openly  before the coming of the day in which there is no barter ing  nor befriending . 32 allah is he who created the heavens and the earth and sent down water from the clouds  then brought forth with it fruits as a sustenance for you  and he has made the ships subservient to you to run their course in the sea by his command  and he has made the rivers subservient to you . rf 33 and he has made subservient to you the sun and the moon  pursuing their courses  and he has made subservient to you the night and the day . 34 and he gives you of all that you ask of him . and if you rivers flow  the rivers corresponding to faith and the trees of the garden corres ponding to the good which a person does . a  26  the evil deed is likened to a tree whose roots do not go down into the earth  and in whose case  therefore  the process of nutrition must stop . therefore an evil deed does not prosper and can not bear any fruit . b  27  allah does what he pleases  but it is the wrongdoers only  whom he leaves in error . the immediate cause of their going astray is their own iniquity . c  28  they reject allah s favour  the revelation  which aims at making them a great and exalted people  and adopt disbelief in its place . d  32  the whole of creation is here  and in the next verse  declared to be made subservient to man  to show his high place in creation . how much then does man degrade himself by worshipping things which were made to serve him  312 14 . abraham â€¢ 14  35 count allah s favours  you will not be able to number them . surely man is very unjust  very ungrateful . section 6  abraham s prayer 35 and when abraham said  my lord  make this city secure  and save me and my sons from worshipping idols.  36 my lord  surely they have led many people astray .  so whoever follows me  he is surely of me  and whoever disobeys me  you surely are for giving  merciful . c 37 0ur lord  i have settled a part of my off spring in a valley unproductive of fruit near your sacred house  our lord  that they may keep up prayer  so make the hearts of some people yearn towards them  and provide them with fruits  perhaps they may be grateful . 38 0ur lord  surely you know what we hide and what we proclaim . and nothing is hidden from allah  either in the earth or in the heaven . 39 praise be to allah  who has given me  in old age  ishmael and isaac  surely my lord is the hearer of prayer . 40 my lord  a  35  that idolatry received a deathblow from the hands of one of abra ham s descendants shows that abraham s prayer was not in vain . b  361  idols do not actually lead people astray  the meaning is that it is on account of them that people go astray . c  362  the prayer of abraham is in fact the prayer of the holy prophet and illustrates the breadth of his view . those who follow him are  of course  his own  but he does not reject even those who disobey him  for he prays for allah s mercy and protection even for them . d  37  according to a hadith report  bukhari  609   abraham brought hagar and ishmael  and settled them near the ruins of the sacred house  the kabah . this  as the hadith states  was done under a divine commandment . for when abraham was going back  on leaving them both in this wilderness  where there was no town at this time  hagar asked him  is it by allah s commandment that you are doing this  abraham s reply was  yes . then said hagar   allah will not leave us to perish  . it is further stated that  when no water was left with her  hagar ran to and fro  between the safa and the marwah  to find out if there was any caravan going that way . it was on this occasion that she saw an angel  who pointed to her a place where she could find water . this was the place known now as zamzam . it was due to this water that some people settled there . even the bible accepts that ishmael s descendants settled in arabia . 14  41 â€¢ man s injustice in rejecting truth 313 make me keep up prayer and  those  from my offspring  too   our lord  and accept my prayer . 4 iour lord  grant me protection and my parents and the believers on the day when the reckoning comes to pass . section 7  the end of opposition 42 and do not think allah to be heedless of what the unjust do . he only gives them respite to a day when the eyes will stare  in terror   43 hastening forward  their heads upraised  their gaze not returning to them  and their hearts vacant .  44 and warn people of a day when the punishment will come to them  then the wrong doers will say  our lord  grant us respite for a short while  we will respond to your call and follow the messengers . did you not swear before  that there will be no passing away for you  45 and you dwell in the abodes of those who wronged themselves  and it is clear to you how we dealt with them and we made  them  examples for you . 46 and they have indeed planned their plan  and their plan is with allah  though their plan is such that the moun tains should be moved by it . 47 so do not think that allah will fail in his promise to his messengers . surely allah is mighty  the lord of retribution . 48 0n the day when the earth will be changed into a different earth  and the heavens  as well   c and they will come forth to allah  the one  a  43  the striking of terror into the hearts of those who opposed the prophet was witnessed in this very life  when the prophet advanced on makkah . the vacancy or blankness of the heart indicates a state of great terror . b  46  the reference is to the plan of the quraish to put an end to the prophet s life  when he was left almost alone in makkah . the words their plan is with allah signify that their plan is controlled by allah  who will make it ineffec tive . a wonderful prophecy indeed in the mouth of a man whose only chance of saving himself now lay in escaping from his enemies  while they were taking every precaution not to allow him to escape  having decided to put him to death  c  48  the transformation wrought by the holy prophet no doubt changed the earth into a different earth and the heaven into a new heaven . the arabia at the birth of the prophet was not the arabia at his death . beliefs  usages  and prac tices  which had baffled all attempts at reformation for centuries  were swept away  and the ignorant  superstitious  and warring tribes had become a single nation  314 14 . abraham â€¢ 14  49 the supreme . 49 and you will see the guilty on that day linked together in chains  â€ ” 50 their shirts made of pitch  and fire cover ing their faces  s1 that allah may repay each soul what it has earned . surely allah is swift in reckoning . 52 this is a message for the people and that they may be warned by it  and that they may know that he is one god  and that those who have understanding may be mindful . holding aloft the torch of knowledge and civilization to the whole world . idolatry was blotted out of existence so completely that no vestige of it could be found among a people who had remained addicted to it for centuries . and that great change must now come over the whole world . but the spiritual resurrection is only an indication of the great day of resurrection . a  49  the powerful opponents of the prophet were brought before him linked together in chains in this very life  at the battle of badr . these promises were fulfilled in this life to show that they were equally true as regards the next . chapter 15 aimjr the rock this chapter is named the rock after the dwellers of the rock mentioned in v. 80  whose fate is a warning to those who sought to kill the holy prophet . the chapter begins with the grand promise that the quran shall forever be guarded against all corruption and all attempts to annihilate it  v. 9  . it goes on to declare that evildoers can not inflict any injury on the chosen ones of god and that the devil s opposition has always failed . then it gives examples of how opponents of previous prophets were destroyed . this chapter was revealed at makkah . 0 85 section 1  the quran is guarded in the name of allah  the beneficent  the merciful . 1 i  allah  am the seer . these are the verses of the book and  of  a quran that makes clear . 2 often will those who disbelieve wish that they were muslims .  3 leave them to eat and enjoy themselves  and let  false  hope be guile them  for they will soon know . 4 and never did we destroy a town but it had a decree made known . 5 no people can hasten on their doom  nor postpone it . 6 and they say  fou  to whom the reminder is revealed  you are indeed mad . 7 why do you not bring the angels to us  if you are truthful  8 we do not send angels but with truth  and then they a  2  the passage does not refer only to life after death . the opponents  who thought islam would soon be annihilated  must no doubt have felt after in life  when the truth of islam became manifest  that it would have been much better for them if they had accepted islam at the first call of the prophet . b  7  the words if you are truthful clearly show that the coming of angels is demanded in relation to the fulfilment of prophecies . in the next verse they are told that the angels will be sent  in accordance with the requirements of truth and justice  when they are required to execute the judgment of the doom of the opponents . 315 316 15 . the rock â€¢ 15  9 would not be given respite . surely we have revealed the reminder  and surely we are its guardian .  10 and certainly we sent  messengers  before you among the sects of old . n and never did a messenger come to them but they mocked him . 12 thus do we make it enter the hearts of the guilty  â€ ” 13 they do not believe in it  and the example of the ancients has gone before . 14 and even if we open to them a gate of heaven  and they keep on ascending into it  15 they would say  only our eyes have been covered over  rather we are a people under enchant ment section 2  forces of evil will be destroyed 16 and certainly we have made strongholds in the heaven  and we have made it attractive for the onlookers  17 and we guard it against every accursed devil  18 but he who steals a hearing  so there follows him a visible flame . d a  9  this is one of the most wonderful prophecies  whose fulfilment is  and will ever remain  a standing testimony to the truth of the holy quran  that the quran will for all time be preserved safe against all attempts to destroy it and from every kind of corruption . the fulfilment of this prophecy is so evident a fact that a hostile writer like sir william muir admitted that  there is probably in the world no other work which has remained twelve centuries with so pure a text   the life of mahomet  1861  ch . 1  . in the whole length and breadth of the islamic world there does not exist a single copy with any variation from the recognized text  and thus not only was the quran preserved from destruction against a powerful enemy  but it has also been preserved from corruption . b  12  thus refers to the mockery mentioned in the previous verse . due to their mockery  it enters their hearts not to believe in the divine message . c  15  verses 1415 speak of the hardness of their hearts . they were deter mined to reject the truth and did not pay any attention to the clearest evidence . d  18  the three verses 1618 speak of the soothsayers and the diviners  who were among the opponents of the holy prophet  they pretended to receive communications from on high . we are here told that they were really driven from the divine presence  and therefore could not have any access to that source of purity . in speaking of the divinations as being followed by a visible flame  it is indicated that they meet with failure and disappointment . the description of spiri tual truths in words relating to physical laws prevailing in the world is of common occurrence in the quran . 15  19 â€¢ forces of evil will be destroyed 317 19 and the earth â€ ” we have spread it out and made in it firm mountains and caused to grow in it of every suitable thing . 20 and we have made in it means of subsistence for you and for those  creatures  for whom you do not provide . 21 and there is not a thing but with us are the treasures of it  and we do not send it down but in a known measure . 22 and we send the winds fertili zing  then send down water from the clouds   so we give it to you to drink  nor is it you who store it up . 23 and surely it is we  who give life and cause death  and we are the inheritors . 24 and certainly we know those among you who go forward and we certainly know those who lag behind . 25 and surely jour lord will gather them together . he indeed is wise  knowing . section 3  the devil s opposition to the righteous 26 and surely we created man of sounding clay  of black mud fashioned into shape . 27 and the jinn  we created before of intensely hot fire . 28 and when jour lord said to the angels  i am going to a  22  the fertilizing winds represent the signs of the progress of islam before its final triumph  which is indicated by the rain from the clouds . b  23  one who inherits is the one who remains after another has perished . the announcement made here is a prophecy that the true worshippers of allah will be heirs in the land while the others will perish . c  25  one meaning is that those who are foremost in accepting truth and those who lag behind in accepting it will all be gathered together  i.e.  ultimately those who now lag behind will be brought over to the right course . d  27  see also 712 footnote . man s creation from dust also refers to his low and humble origin and his temperate nature  as opposed to another kind of crea tion of a fiery nature  which is called theinn or the devil . the two words  jinn and devil  are frequently applied to men of a fiery temperament or rebellious nature who lead others to evil . these descriptions of the creation of men and jinn axe  allegorical  referring respectively to the nature of those who are submissive to divine laws and those who rebel against them  and the allegory is carried on further in what is stated of the rebellion of the devil against adam . the two des criptions of the origin of man  his being made from clay that gives sound and of mud that is fashioned into shape  refer to the two great characteristics which give man a superiority over other animals  namely  his use of language and the perfec tion of his make . 318 15 . the rock â€¢ 15  29 create a mortal of sounding clay  of black mud fashioned into shape . 29 so when i have made him complete and breathed into him of my spirit   fall down making submission to him . 30 so the angels sub mitted  all of them together â€ ” 31 but not iblts . he refused to be with those who submitted . 32 he said  o iblts  what is the reason that you are not with those who submit  33 he said  i am not going to submit to a mortal  whom you have created of sounding clay  of black mud fashioned into shape . 34 he said  then go forth  for surely you are driven away  35 and surely on you is a curse till the day of judgment . 36 he said  my lord  grant me respite till the day when they are raised . 37 he said  surely you are granted respite  38 till the day of the time made known . 39 he said  my lord  as you have judged me to be in error i shall certainly make  evil  seem good to them on earth  and i shall cause them all to deviate  40 except your servants from among them  the purified ones . 41 he said  this is a right way with me . 42 as regards my servants  you have no authority over them except such of the deviators as follow you . 43 and surely hell is the pro mised place for them all â€ ” 44 it has seven gates . for each gate is an appointed portion of them . e a  29  this shows that man is made complete when the divine spirit is breathed into him . the divine spirit  arabic  riih  does not mean here the animal soul in man  but the spirit of allah that gives him perfection . b  36  when a man is raised to life spiritually  the suggestions and the promptings of the devil cease to affect him . but until he finds spiritual life  evil suggestions mislead him now and then . this is the  time made known  in v. 38. c  39  the meaning is clearly  as you have judged me to be in error  and not caused me to be in error . d  42  in a broad sense all people are servants of allah . that the devil has no authority over them is clear from 1422  where the devil says to his followers   i had no authority over you  except that i called you and you obeyed me .  e  44  the seven gates mean the seven ways which lead into it  according to which there are seven different names of hell in the quran . however  the numeral seven in arabic often stands for a large number  so that the meaning may be that there are many gates or many ways leading to it . 1 5  45 â€¢ mercy for the righteous 3 1 9 section 4  mercy for the righteous â€ ” abraham 45 surely those who keep their duty are in gardens and foun tains . 46 enter them in peace  secure . 47 and we shall remove what ever of bitterness is in their hearts â€ ” as brothers  on thrones  facing each other . 48 toil does not afflict them therein  nor will they be ejected from there .  49 inform my servants that i am the forgiving  the merciful  50 and that my punishment â€ ” that is the painful punishment . 51 and inform them of the guests of abraham . 52 when they came to him  they said  peace  he said  we are afraid of you . 53 they said  do not be afraid  we give you good news of a boy  possessing knowledge . 54 he said  do you give me good news when old age has come upon me  of what then do you give me good news  55 they said  we give you good news with truth  so do not be from among the despairing ones . 56 he said  and who despairs of the mercy of his lord except those in error  57 he said  what is your business  then  messengers  58 they said  we have been sent to a guilty people  59 except lot s follow ers . we shall deliver them all  60 except his wife  we ordained that she shall surely be among those who remain behind . section 5  lot and shuaib 61 so when the messengers came to lot s followers  62 he said  surely you are an unknown people . 63 they said  indeed  we have come to you with that about which they disputed . 64 and we have come to you with the truth  and we are surely truthful . a  48  such is the muslim paradise . there is absolute peace of mind  perfect security from any inclination to evil or any other danger  v. 46   there is a bro therhood in which no one conceals any rancour in his heart for his brother  nor has anyone a complaint against another  v. 47   and lastly  there is neither toil nor fati gue  nor is one to be ever deprived of that state of perfect bliss  v. 48  . this verse further establishes that those who are once made to enter paradise are not sent back to this world  and that therefore the garden in which adam was at first placed was not the paradise of heavenly life  for in that case he would not have been ejected from it . 320 15 . the rock â€¢ 15  65 65 so travel with your followers for a part of the night  yourself following behind them  and let not anyone of you turn round  and go where you are commanded . 66 and we made known to him this decree  that the roots of these should be cut off in the morning . 67 and the people of the town came rejoicing . 68 he said  these are my guests  so do not disgrace me  69 and keep your duty to allah and do not shame me . 70 they said  did we not forbid you from  entertaining  people  71 he said  these are my daughters  if you are going to do anything.  72 by your life  they blindly wan dered on in their frenzy . 73 so the cry overtook them at sunrise  74 thus we turned it upside down  and rained upon them stones  as decreed . 75 surely in this are signs for those who take a lesson . 76 and it is on a road that still abides . 77 surely in this is a sign for the believers . 78 and the dwellers of the grove were indeed wrongdoers  79 so we inflicted retribution on them . and they are both on an open high road . c section 6  dwellers of the rock and a warning 80 and the dwellers of the rock indeed rejected the messen gers  81 and we gave them our messages  but they turned away from them  82 and they carved houses in the mountains  in security . 83 so the cry overtook them in the morning  84 and what they earned did not avail them . 85 and we did not create the heavens and the earth and all that is between them but with truth . and the hour is surely com ing  so turn away with kindly forgiveness . 6 86 surely your lord â€ ” a  71  see 1178 footnote . b  78  the dwellers of the grove were shuaib s people . c  79  by both are meant the cities of the people of lot as well as those of shuaib s people . the road alluded to is the road followed by caravans from the hijaz to syria . d  80  the dwellers of the rock are the people of thamud  see 773 note 1. e  85  just one of many instances of the holy prophet s forgiveness was at the 15  87 â€¢ dwellers of the rock 321 he is the creator  the knower . 87 and certainly we have given you seven oftrepeated  verses  and the grand quran .  88 do not strain your eyes  with desire  at what we have given certain classes of them to enjoy  nor grieve for them  and make yourself gentle to the believers .  89 and say  i am indeed the plain warner . 90 like as we sent down on them who took oaths  91 those who divided the quran into parts . 92 so  by your lord  we shall question them all  93 as to what they did . 94 therefore declare openly what you are commanded  and turn away from those who set up partners  with allah  . 95 surely we are sufficient for you against the scoffers â€ ” 96 those who set up another god with allah  so they will come to know . 97 and we know indeed that your heart is distressed at what they say  98 so celebrate the praise of your lord  and be of those who prostrate  before him  .  and serve your lord  until there comes to you what is certain . c conquest of makkah  when  having captured the city which had most tyrannically driven him out with his followers  and whose people were guilty of shedding the innocent blood of the muslims  he forgave all . a  87  the holy prophet is reported to have said that the  seven oftrepeated verses  were the seven verses of the fatihah  the first chapter of the quran .  bukhari  651  . according to the same hadith  the fatihah is called the grand quran . it is so called because it contains the essence of the whole of the quran . b  88  the riches and embellishments of this life had no temptation for the holy prophet . the unequalled simplicity of his life from the time that he married a rich widow to the time that he ruled arabia may be guessed from the last scene of his life  when he ordered the last penny in his house to be given to the poor . the verse  moreover  draws a picture of the utmost kindness and gentleness which he showed to his followers . the straining of the eyes signifies looking desirously . c  99  what is certain is here generally taken to mean death  bukhari  65.155   because it is the one thing which is certain to come to every creature . chapter 16 ainam the bee this chapter is so named because the bee  guided by its instinct which is called  revelation  in 1668  gathers honey from flowers by taking the best of what is in them  producing  a beverage of many colours in which there is healing for human beings   1669  . similarly  divine revelation to the holy prophet collected the best in previous revealed teachings and presented it in the quran  which is also called  a healing  for people  1057  . this chapter begins by mentioning the benefits which god has conferred upon man in physical nature to show that he also bestows upon him spiritual gifts . those who reject these gifts will come to disgrace but god is slow to punish . revelation is necessary  but not every person can receive it directly . the best ones are chosen for it . revelation teaches the doing of good  and the quran replaces previous revelation . those who reject it are then compared to a flourishing town which is made to suffer because of the ingratitude of its people . lastly  muslims are given certain golden directions to follow in order to be a great nation . this chapter was revealed in the last period at makkah . section 1  revelation testified to by nature in the name of allah  the beneficent  the merciful . 1 allah s commandment will come  so do not seek to hasten it . a glory be to him  and supremely exalted is he above what they set up as partners  with him   2 he sends down angels with reve lation by his command on whom he pleases of his servants  saying  give the warning that there is no god but me  so keep your duty to me . 3 he created the heavens and the earth with truth . supremely exalted is he above what they set up as partners  with him   a  1  the disbelievers are asked not to hasten the punishment  for allah  who conferred so many physical benefits on them  and is willing to bestow his spiritual gifts  as mercy has the foremost place in divine nature . this is stated in the verses that follow . what that punishment was going to be is expressly stated at the end of this chapter  v. 1 12  . 322 164â « nature upholds unity 323 4 he created man from a small lifegerm   and lo  he is an open contender . 5 and the cattle  he has created them for you . you have in them warm clothing and  other  advantages  and of them you eat . 6 and therein is beauty for you  when you drive them back  home  and when you send them out  to pasture  . 7 and they carry your heavy loads to regions which you could not reach but with distress to yourselves . surely your lord is compassionate  merci ful . 8 and  he made  horses and mules and asses that you might ride upon them and as an ornament . and he creates what you do not know . 9 and upon allah it rests to show the right way  and there are some deviating  ways  . and if he please  he would guide all of you aright . section 2  nature upholds unity 10 he it is who sends down water from the clouds for you  it gives drink  and by it  grow  the trees on which you feed . n he causes to grow for you by it vegetation  and the olives  and the datepalms  and the grapes  and all the fruits . surely there is a sign in this for a people who reflect . 12 and he has made subservient to you the night and the day and the sun and the moon . and the stars are made subservient by his command . surely there are signs in this for a people who understand . 13 and what he has created for you in the earth is of varied colours . surely there is a sign in this for a people who are mindful . 14 and he it is who has made the sea subservient that you may eat fresh flesh from it and bring forth from it ornaments which you wear . and you see the ships cleaving through it  so that you seek of his bounty and that you may give thanks . 15 and he has cast firm mountains in the earth in case it should quake with you  and rivers and roads that you may go aright  a  4  the word nutfah used refers here to seminal fluid . b  15  these words seem to point to the great upheavals and the violent agita tions which led to the formation of the mountains  before man s existence on earth  and  that having been effected  the convulsions are now comparatively insigni ficant  making life possible . but these words can also be translated as meaning that they may be a source of benefit to you . in accordance with this we have else where   and the mountains  he made them firm  a provision for you and for your cattle   793233  . 324 16 . the bee â€¢ 16  16 16 and landmarks . and by the stars they find the right way . 17 is he then who creates like him who does not create  are you not then mindful  18 and if you would count allah s favours  you would not be able to number them . surely allah is forgiving  merciful . 19 and allah knows what you conceal and what you do openly . 20 and those whom they call on besides allah created nothing  while they are themselves created . 21 dead  are they   not living . and they do not know when they will be raised .  section 3  denial due to ignorance 22 your god is one god  so those who do not believe in the hereafter  their hearts refuse to know and they are proud .  undoubtedly allah knows what they conceal and what they do openly . surely he does not love the proud . 24 and when it is said to them  what is it that your lord has revealed  they say  stories of the ancients  25 that they may bear their burdens in full on the day of resurrection  and also part of the burdens of those whom they lead astray without knowledge . ah  evil is what they bear . section 4  the wicked will come to disgrace 26 those before them plotted  so allah demolished their build ing from the foundations  so the roof fell down on them from above them  and the punishment came to them from where they did not perceive . 27 then on the day of resurrection he will bring them to disgrace and say  where are my partners  for whose sake you became hostile  those who are given the knowledge will say  surely disgrace this day and evil are upon the disbelievers   28 whom the angels cause to die  while they are unjust to them selves . then would they offer submission  we did not do any evil . a  21  these two verses show conclusively that neither jesus christ nor any other person who is taken for a god ever created anything  and secondly  that jesus was not alive at the time of the revelation of the quran  dead are they  not living . the further statement that they do not even know when they will be raised  shows that the verse speaks of men taken for gods  and at any rate includes them . b  27  disgrace is a sort of hellfire  which they had in this very life  too . 1629 the wicked will come to disgrace 325 yes  surely allah knows what you did . 29 so enter the gates of hell  to abide in it . evil indeed is the dwellingplace of the proud . 30 and it is said to those who guard against evil  what has your lord revealed  they say  good . for those who do good in this world is good . and certainly the abode of the hereafter is better . and excellent indeed is the abode of those who keep their duty â€ ” 31 gardens of perpetuity which they enter  in which rivers flow  they have therein what they please . thus does allah reward those who keep their duty  32 whom the angels cause to die in purity  saying  peace be on you  enter the garden for what you did . 33 they only wait that the angels should come to them or that your lord s command should come to pass .  thus did those before them . and allah did not wrong them  but they wronged them selves . 34 so the evil of what they did afflicted them  and what they mocked at beset them . section 5  prophets are raised to explain 35 and the idolaters say  if allah pleased we would not have served any but him   neither  we nor our fathers  nor would we have prohibited anything without  order from  him . thus did those before them . but have the messengers any duty except to deliver the message clearly  â° 36 and certainly we raised in every nation a messenger  saying  serve allah and shun the devil . then some of them allah guided  and for some of them remaining in a  33  the coming of the angels stands for the smaller afflictions  such as overtook them in the form of famine and war  while the coming to pass of the command of the lord indicates the complete overthrow of their power . b  34  the past tense is used to express the highest degree of certainty rela ting to the future . c  35  they contended that if allah did not like evil he could have diverted them from evil ways . they are told in reply that allah s pleasure is not exercised by compelling people to adopt one way or the other  but by sending his messen gers in every age and to every nation to point out the right way to the people  and by clear messages through his messengers to warn people to avoid evil . 326 16 . the bee â€¢ 16  37 error was justly due .  so travel in the land  then see what was the end of the rejectors . 37 if you desire their guidance  yet allah will not guide him who leads  others  astray   nor do they have any helpers . 38 and they swear by allah their most energetic oaths  allah will not raise up him who dies . yes indeed  it is a promise binding on him  quite true  but most people do not know  39 so that he might make clear to them what they differ about  and that those who disbelieve might know that they were liars . 40 our word for a thing  when we intend it  is only that we say to it  be  and it is . section 6  doom of opponents is coming 41 and those who flee for allah s sake after they are opp ressed  we shall certainly give them a good abode in the world  and the reward of the hereafter is much greater  if only they knew c â€ ” 42 those who are steadfast and on their lord they rely . 43 and we did not send before you any but men to whom we sent revelation â€ ” so ask the followers of the reminder if you do not know â€ ” 44 with clear arguments and scriptures . and we a  36  there were some people who did not care for the prophet s warning and adhered to error . justice therefore required that they should be left in error . the message was sent by god  the choice was man s own to accept or reject it . the words do not mean that allah had foredoomed some people  for then the sending to them of messengers would have been absurd . b  37  those who not only walk in error themselves  but have grown so hos tile to the cause of truth that they mislead others  can not find the right way  how ever much the prophet may be anxious for them . c  41  here is a clear prophecy regarding those muslims who had to flee their homes on account of the persecutions of the quraish . they are promised not only a reward of the hereafter but a good abode in this world  too . those who fled their homes in utter helplessness  and were in danger of their very lives  were given the clearest promise of a great future in this life  and this promise proved true despite the hard struggle of a powerful nation to exterminate islam . d  43  by the followers of the reminder are generally understood the jews and the christians  to whom the disbelievers of the quraish are referred . but the 1645  doom of opponents is coming 327 have revealed to you the reminder that you may make clear to people what has been revealed to them  and that perhaps they may reflect . 45 are they  then  who plan evil  plans   secure that allah will not humble them in the earth  or that punishment will not come upon them from where they do not perceive  46 0r that he will not seize them in their going to and fro  then they will not be able to escape  47 0r that he will not seize them with a gradual reduc tion   your lord is surely compassionate  merciful . 48 do they not see everything that allah has created  its  very  shadows return from right and left  making submission to allah  while they are in utter humility . 49 and to allah submits every living creature that is in the heavens and that is in the earth  and the angels  too  and they are not proud . 50 they fear their lord above them and do what they are commanded . section 7  human nature revolts against polytheism 51 and allah has said  do not take two gods . he is only one god  so me alone should you fear . 52 and whatever is in the heavens and the earth is his  and to him is obedience due always . will you then fear other than allah  53 and whatever good you have  it is from allah  then  when evil afflicts you  to him do you cry for aid . 54 then when he removes the evil from you  lo  some of you set up partners with their lord  55 so as to deny what we have given them . then enjoy yourselves  for soon will you know . 56 and they set apart for what they do not know  a portion of what mention in the very next verse of the reminder being sent to the holy prophet shows that the words apply to the muslims . some commentators take the words generally as meaning learned men . a  47  as verses 41 â€ ” 42 speak of a prosperous future for those who accepted the truth and now were suffering the severest persecutions  verses 4547 speak prophetically of the different forms of punishment to which the persecutors of the righteous were to be subjected  v. 47 stating that they would be reduced gradually . this was their end  as their power went on waning till the whole of arabia bowed before islam . b  56  that is  for the idols or their gods  whom they ignorantly take for intercessors . 328 16 . the bee â€¢ 16  57 we have given them . by allah  you shall certainly be questioned about what you forged . 57 and they ascribe daughters to allah . glory be to him  and for themselves is what they desire  58 and when the birth of a daughter is announced to one of them  his face becomes dark and he is full of wrath . 59 he hides himself from the people because of the evil of what is announced to him . shall he keep it with disgrace or bury it  alive  in the dust  now surely evil is what they judge   60 for those who do not believe in the hereafter are evil attributes and allah s are the sublime attributes . and he is the mighty  the wise . section 8  wrongdoing of deniers 61 and if allah were to destroy people for their wrongdoing  he would not leave on it a single creature  but he gives them res pite till an appointed time . so when their doom comes they can not postpone it an hour  nor  can they  bring it forward . 62 and they ascribe to allah what they  themselves  hate   and their tongues relate the lie that for them is good . assuredly for them is the fire  and they will be abandoned  in it  . 63 by allah  we certainly sent  messengers  to nations before you  but the devil made their deeds seem good to them . so he is their patron today  and for them is a painful punishment . 64 and we have not revealed to you the book except that you may make clear to them what they differ about  and  as  a guidance and a mercy for a people who believed 65 and a  59  the allusion is to the barbarous custom of burying daughters alive  which was prevalent among the arabs  especially among their chiefs . its abolition was one of the numerous blessings of islam . with no physical or administrative power behind it to ensure its enforcement  the word of allah swept away this deeprooted custom as if by a magician s wand  so that not a single case of the burial of a living girl ever occurred after the mandate came . attention is drawn to the inconsistency of their avowed beliefs with their inward convictions in v. 62. b  62  the reference is to their ascribing daughters to allah  while they themselves did not like to have a daughter  thus showing how obviously inconsis tent with their inward convictions was their professed belief in the divine being . c  64  the previous verse shows that the whole world was in the grip of the 16  66 â€¢ parables showing truth of revelation 329 allah sends down water from above  and with it gives life to the earth after its death .  surely there is a sign in this for a people who listen . section 9  parables showing truth of revelation 66 and surely there is a lesson for you in the cattle  we give you to drink of what is in their bellies â€ ” from between the faeces and the blood â€ ” pure milk  agreeable to the drinkers . 67 and of the fruits of the palms and the grapes  you obtain from them intoxi cants and goodly provision . there is surely a sign in this for a people who ponder . 68 and jour lord revealed to the bee  make hives in the moun tains and in the trees and in what they build  69 then eat of all the fruits and walk in the ways of jour lord submissively . from their devil at the advent of the prophet . messengers were sent to all nations before the coming of the prophet  but as time passed  the followers of the messengers  ins tead of following their teachings  followed evil ways  which gradually appeared to them so beautiful that the good of this world was all in all for them . this verse shows that the teachings of the previous prophets had been distorted to such an extent that a new prophet was now needed to lead them aright . truth could not now be discovered without light from heaven . it also establishes that the new prophet s message was for the followers of all religions  in other words  for the whole world . a  65  the water from heaven is the divine revelation  the death of the earth is its corruption  and the giving of life signifies its spiritual awakening  marvellous signs of which had already appeared in arabia . b  67  verses 66 and 67 compare the divine laws as manifested in nature with the handiwork of man . divine law in nature produces such a valuable and agreeable diet as pure milk  separating it from the other elements â€ ” blood and dung â€ ” to which food is reduced in the belly of an animal  which the hand of man is unable to do . on the other hand  the most agreeable provisions produced by nature in the form of fruits are turned into such a poisonous drug as alcohol by the hand of man . the two illustrations thus point out that just as divine laws working in the physical world produce the purest and most agreeable diets  sepa rating them from obnoxious elements and useless excrements  so their working in the spiritual world produces the most sublime moral teachings  which afford to man the purest spiritual diet . but the best teachings given by divine revelation are likely to be corrupted by the hands of man  as the best of fruits is turned into such an obnoxious thing as alcohol . 330 16 . the bee â€¢ 16  70 bellies comes forth a beverage of many colours  in which there is healing for man . surely in this there is a sign for a people who reflect .  70 and allah creates you  then he causes you to die  and some of you are brought back to the worst part of life  knowing nothing after having knowledge . surely allah is knowing  powerful . section 10  the recipient of revelation 71 and allah has made some of you excel others in the means of subsistence  so those who are made to excel do not give away their sustenance to those whom their right hands possess  so that they may be equal in it . will they then deny the favour of allah  c a  69  this is another illustration to show that divine revelation brings about an object which can not be effected by human exertions . the bee gathers the sweet juice of different flowers  making it into honey . what this small creature effects  working instinctively in obedience to divine laws  can not be effected by the com bined exertions of the whole of humanity . this illustration shows a similar work ing of the divine laws in the spiritual world  viz.  that the prophet  working  as it were  instinctively in obedience to the divine laws prevailing in the spiritual world  collects by divine revelation all that is best and noblest in any religion  and sums it up in the quran  a work which could not be effected by human exertion . it should be noted that five kinds of the wahy  revelation  of allah are men tioned in the quran  a revelation to inanimate objects  as the earth  995  or the heavens  4112   a revelation to living creatures other than man  as the bee  a revelation to the angels  812   a revelation to men and women other than prophets  as the apostles of jesus  5111  or the mother of moses  287   and a revelation to prophets and messengers . all these kinds of wahy are not identical  in the case of the bee  it is its very instinct that is a revelation to it . the revelation to the prophets is the expression of divine will for the guidance of people . b  70  as in individuals  so in nations . those who had been given knowledge of divine revelation before the holy prophet had lost or corrupted it at the time of his advent  hence the necessity for a new divine revelation . c  71  this provides an answer to the demand of the disbelievers expressly stated elsewhere   we will not believe till we are given the like of what allah s messengers are given   6124  . it is pointed out that  as there are differences in the physical world  so there are differences in the spiritual world . all persons are not equally fit to receive the gift of divine revelation . the favour of allah  which is the divine revelation  should not be denied simply because all individuals are not equal recipients of it . 1 6  72 â€¢ the recipient of revelation 331 72 and allah has made wives for you from among yourselves   and has given you sons and daughters from your wives  and has pro vided you with good things . will they then believe in falsehood and deny the favour of allah  73 and they serve besides allah that which controls for them no sustenance at all from the heavens and the earth  nor have they any power . 74 so do not coin likenesses for allah . surely allah knows and you do not know . 75 allah sets forth a parable  there is a slave  the property of another  controlling nothing  and there is one to whom we have granted from ourselves a goodly provision  so he spends from it  on good works  secretly and openly . are the two alike  praise be to allah  but most of them do not know . e 76 and allah sets forth a parable of two men  one of them dumb  controlling nothing  and he is a burden to his master  wherever he sends him  he brings no good . is he equal with him who enjoins justice  and he is on the right path  a  721  the statement made here is that for all men wives are created from their anfus  plural of nafs  meaning soul or self  . no one ever interprets these words in the erroneous way in which similar words about adam are misinter preted  where the rib is made to take the place of soul or self . the words of the quran do not allow this unnatural interpretation  which is based upon the story of genesis . b  722  they believe in the superstition that the idols  which are inanimate objects  can intercede with allah  and deny the favour of allah  i.e . divine revela tion  being granted to a human being . hence the next verse speaks of the idols . c  75  by slave is meant the idolworshipper who  instead of being master of idols  stones  and suchlike objects  as allah has created him to be  chooses to become a slave to them  bows before them  and considers them more powerful than himself . by the master of the goodly provision from allah is meant the recip ient of the divine revelation  i.e.  the prophet . the comparison is made to show that the idol worshippers will ultimately find themselves deprived of all power . d  76  this parable makes the same comparison as the previous one . the purport is here made clearer . the master of the goodly provision from allah of the previous verse is here plainly called the enjoiner of justice and the one who is on the right path  while the idolworshipper is the one who is not able to do anything and who remains unsuccessful in whatever he undertakes â€ ” a prophetical allu sion to the defeats and discomfiture of the idolaters . 332 16 . the bee â€¢1611 section 1 1  punishment withheld 77 and allah s is the unseen of the heavens and the earth . and the matter of the hour is but as a twinkling of the eye or it is nearer still . a surely allah is powerful over all things . 78 and allah brought you forth from the wombs of your mothers â€ ” you knew nothing â€ ” and he gave you hearing and sight and hearts that you might give thanks . 79 do they not see the birds  constrained in the middle of the sky  none withholds them but allah . surely there are signs in this for a people who believe . 80 and allah has given you an abode in your houses  and he has given you houses of the skins of cattle  which you find light to carry on the day of your march and on the day of your halting  and of their wool and their fur and their hair  household stuff and a provision for a time . 81 and allah has made for you  out of what he has created  shelters  and he has given you in the mountains  places of retreat  and he has given you garments to save you from the heat and  protective  garments to save you in your fighting . thus does he complete his favour to you that you may submit . 82 then if they turn away  your duty is only to deliver the message clearly . 83 they recognize the favour of allah  yet they deny it  and most of them are ungrateful . a  77  by the unseen is meant the knowledge of the unseen  or the knowledge of the eventual fulfilment of the prophecies  and by the hour is meant the hour of the doom of the opponents of the prophet  the hour when their power was to be utterly destroyed . b  79  both arab proverb and arab poetry bear witness to birds being spoken of as attending a victorious army to feed upon the corpses of the enemy left on the battlefield . in withholding the birds  therefore  there may be a reference to with holding the punishment which must ultimately overtake the enemy . c  811  the mention of one of two contrary things always involves the other . hence by the preservation from heat spoken of here  preservation from heat and cold alike is meant . d  812  as he has given you of the good things of this life  the physical blessings  he now completes these blessings by giving you the greatest of his blessings  i.e.  divine revelation  so that  submitting to it  you may prosper . 1684  prophets testify 333 section 12  prophets testify 84 and on the day when we raise up a witness out of every nation   then permission  to offer excuse  will not be given to the disbelievers  nor will they be allowed to make amends . 85 and when the wrongdoers see the punishment  it will not be lightened for them  nor will they be given respite . 86 and when those who set up partners  with allah  see their associategods  they will say  our lord  these are our associategods on whom we called besides you . but they will throw back at them the word  surely you are liars . 87 and they will tender submission to allah on that day  and what they used to forge will fail them . 88 those who disbelieve and hinder  people  from allah s way  we will add punishment to their punishment because they made mischief . 89 and on the day when we raise up in every people a witness against them from among themselves  and bring you as a witness against these . and we have revealed the book to you explaining all things and a guidance and mercy and good news for those who submit . section 13  revelation enjoins good 90 surely allah commands  the doing of  justice and the doing of good  to others  and the giving to the near of kin  and he forbids indecency and evil and rebellion . he instructs you that you may be mindful .  91 and fulfil the covenant of allah  when you have a  84  in this verse  as well as in the concluding verse  v. 89  of this section  the broad humanitarian doctrine is taught that a prophet has been raised in every nation . there are religions which claim hundreds of prophets for a single nation  like the house of israel  but grudge even a single true prophet to other vast coun tries and nations . islam rejects all such narrow views of the spiritual providence of allah  who is not the  lord god of israel   but the lord of all nations . b  891  by these are meant the muslim community throughout the world and in all ages . c  892  by everything is meant every basic principle necessary for the spiri tual welfare of man . the sunnah  the practice of the prophet  as illustrating the precepts of the quran  supplies the details . d  90  this verse deals with the different degrees of goodness and evil . the 334 16 . the bee â€¢ 16  92 made a covenant  and do not break  your  oaths after making them firm  and you have indeed made allah your surety . surely allah knows what you do . 92 and do not be like her who unravels her yarn  disinteg rating it into pieces  after she has spun it strongly .  you make your oaths to be means of deceit between you because  one  nation is more numerous than  another  nation . allah only tries you by this . and he will certainly make clear to you on the day of resurrection what you differed about . 93 and if allah please  he would make you a single nation  but he leaves in error whom he pleases and guides whom he pleases . and certainly you will be questioned as to what you did . 94 and do not make your oaths a means of deceit between you  so that a foot should slip after its stability  and you should taste evil because you hinder  people  from allah s way and severe punishment be your  lot  . 95 and do not take a small price for allah s covenant . surely what is with allah is better for you  if only you knew  96 what is with you passes away and what is with allah is enduring . and we shall lowest form of goodness is justice or returning good for good  and includes not only justice proper but also the fulfilment of all duties and obligations . a higher degree of goodness is  however  that which is called ihsan  or goodness proper  the doing of good without having received any benefit . the last stage of goodness is that in which a person s nature is so inclined to good that he does good to all people as an ordinary man does good to his own near of kin . in fact  he looks upon the whole of humanity as his kindred . similarly  this verse deals with the three degrees of evil  the merest indecency which may not affect the rights of others  evil actions which affect the rights of other individuals  and oppression or rebellion affecting the rights of large numbers  nations or states . a  921  people  after accepting the truth  are united by certain ties  but when this union brings about strength  they destroy it with their own hands . it was unity which made the muslims rise to great power  but that unity today lies in ruins  and the strong community of islam is like the unravelled yarn of a crazy spinner . b  922  faithfulness to covenants is here stressed and  from the covenant with god  the subject is diverted to covenants between people . attention is drawn in the words  you make your oaths to be means of deceit between you  to the conditions generally prevailing in the world  to the breach of covenants between nations  which is ruining the stability of human society . 1697  the quran is not a forgery 335 certainly give to those who are patient their reward for the best of what they did . 97 whoever does good  whether male or female   and is a believer  we shall certainly make him live a good life  and we shall certainly give them their reward for the best of what they did . 98 so when you recite the quran  seek refuge in allah from the accursed devil .  surely he has no authority over those who believe and rely on their lord . 100 his authority is only over those who befriend him and those who set up partners with him . section 14  the quran is not a forgery 101 and when we change a message for a message â€ ” and allah knows best what he reveals â€ ” they say  7ou are only a forger . rather  most of them do not know . 102 say  the holy spirit has revealed it from jour lord with truth  c that it may estab lish those who believe  and as a guidance and good news for those who submit . 103 and indeed we know that they say  only a mortal teaches him . the tongue of him whom they hint at is foreign  and this is clear arabic language . 104 those who do not believe in a  97  the doers of good  both men and women  are made to lead a good life in this world and will have a reward in the hereafter . b  101  it is not the change of the quranic verses that is spoken of here  it is the change of the previous messages sent through former prophets for the message of the holy quran . this chapter belongs to makkah  and the upholders of abro gation have never asserted that any verse was abrogated while the holy prophet was at makkah . moreover  it was the revelation of the quran itself that was called a forgery  and not an occasional change that any of its commandments could have undergone  with which change the disbelievers had  in fact  no concern . see also 2106 footnote . c  102  the holy spirit  ruh alqudus  is here stated to be the bearer of the revelation to the holy prophet  elsewhere the same bearer is called alruh al arriin  or the faithful spirit  26  193   and the same is called gabriel in 297. d  103  various names have been suggested as to the person whom the opponents of the prophet referred to . these are mostly the names of christian slaves  who were not arabs . all these slaves were among the early converts to islam  who were most cruelly persecuted by the quraish  yet they remained firm under the severest tortures . is it possible that they  without being in the least 336 16 . the bee 16105 allah s messages  allah does not guide them  and for them is a painful punishment . 105 only they forge lies who do not believe in allah s messages  and they are the liars .  106 whoever disbelieves in allah after his belief â€ ” not he who is compelled while his heart is content with faith  but he who opens  his  breast for disbelief â€ ” they incur allah s displeasure  and for them is a grievous punishment . 107 that is because they love this world s life more than the hereafter  and because allah does not guide the disbelieving people . 108 these are they whose hearts and ears and eyes allah has sealed and these are the heed less ones . c 109 no doubt that in the hereafter they are the losers . 110 then surely your lord  to those who flee after they are persecu ted  then struggle hard and are patient  surely jour lord after that is protecting  merciful . section 15  fate of the opponents 111 on the day when every soul will come pleading for itself  gainers  should have thus willingly suffered persecutions for a cause which they knew to be false  this is sufficient to show the absurdity of the allegation  and it is to this that v. 105 refers . they certainly can not be supposed to have been the authors of the sublime themes of the holy quran . a  105  the reference is to v. 103 . the allegation was that certain slaves taught the prophet . how could a forger of lies be a believer  especially when he had to undergo the severest trials for its sake . b  106  only very rare instances are met with in the early history of islam in which converts even under compulsion ever recanted . c  108  allah does not seal the hearts of people and thus hinder them from accepting the truth  it is they who reject the truth  turning a deaf ear to the preach ing of the prophet  as the previous verses show . nor are the hearts sealed forever  for  as v. 110 shows  even after that allah forgives them  if they repent and show perseverance . rf  110  the struggle  jihad  spoken of here is certainly not in connection with fighting  for the verse was revealed at makkah . note also that god is spoken of here as being ghaffir  translated as protecting  to those who flee from their homes on account of persecution and then struggle hard to establish truth . god being ghafiir here is in relation to his exalting them by protecting them from the commission of sins  not forgiving of sins  for it is their acts of sacrifice that are spoken of here  not their sins . 16112  fate of the opponents 337 and every soul will be paid in full what it has done  and they will not be dealt with unjustly . 112 and allah sets forth a parable  a town safe and secure  to which its means of subsistence came in abun dance from every quarter  but it disbelieved in allah s favours  so allah made it taste a pall of hunger and fear because of what they did .  113 and certainly a messenger came to them from among them  but they rejected him  so the punishment caught them while they were wrongdoers . 114 so eat of what allah has given you  lawful and good  things   and give thanks for allah s favour  if he it is you serve . n5 he has forbidden you only what dies of itself and blood and the flesh of swine and that on which any other name than that of allah has been invoked  but whoever is driven to  it   not desiring nor exceeding the limit  then surely allah is forgiving  merciful .  116 and do not utter the lie which your tongues describe  this is lawful and this unlawful  so that you forge a lie against allah . surely those who forge a lie against allah will not prosper . 117 a little enjoyment â€ ” and for them is a painful punishment . 118 and to those who are jews we prohibited what we have related to you already  and we did not wrong them  but they wronged them selves . 119 and surely jour lord  for those who do evil in igno rance  then turn after that and make amends  surely jour lord after that is forgiving  merciful . a  112  the parable is set forth to depict the state of makkah as it was before the time of the holy prophet and  prophetically  its fate after he was rejected  after it disbelieved in allah s favours . its first condition was one of great prosperity and affluence  as referred to in 1063 â€ ” 4 . when the prophet and his followers were persecuted and tortured  a famine overtook them  which destroyed everything  till they ate skins and dead animals . this was the pall of hunger  spoken of here . but  even then  they did not stop persecution and tried to exterminate islam by the sword . the result was that all their attacks on madinah failed  and ultimately makkah itself lay powerless when attacked by the prophet . this was the pall of fear  being so called because no blood was shed . b  115  see 2173  6145 and 53  and the footnotes there . 338 16 . the bee â€¢ 16  120 section 16  the way to greatness 120 surely abraham was a model  of virtue   obedient to allah  upright  and he was not from among the idolaters  121 grateful for his favours . he chose him and guided him on the right path . 122 and we gave him good in this world  and in the hereafter he is surely among the righteous . 123 then we revealed to you  follow the faith of abraham  the upright one  and he was not from among the idolaters . 124 the sabbath was ordained only against those who differed about it .  and surely your lord will judge between them on the day of resurrection in that in which they differed . 125 call to the way of your lord with wisdom and goodly exhortation  and argue with them in the best manner . surely your lord knows best him who strays from his path  and he knows best those who go aright . 126 and if you take your turn  then retaliate with the like of what you were afflicted with . c but if you show patience  it is certainly best for the patient . 127 and be patient and your patience is not but by  the help of  allah  and do not grieve for them  nor be in distress by what they plan . 128 surely allah is with those who keep their duty and those who do good  to others  . a  124  the meaning here seems to be that the sabbath  the jewish day of worship which should have made them walk in the footsteps of righteous abraham  was turned against them because of their violation of it . or  the statement is made to show that it was not necessary for the muslims to observe a day of worship  as even abraham  a model of virtue for both the jews and the muslims  did not observe a particular day of worship . b  125  the principle laid down for preaching and religious controversy by the quran has yet to be learned by the most advanced people . it shows the breadth of mind of the holy prophet  more especially when it is remembered that the injunction was given at a time when muslims were being most severely perse cuted and there was the greatest reason for adopting a harsh attitude . c  126  muslims were being persecuted most cruelly  and they were told that the time would come when they would dominate their erstwhile persecutors . in that case they are allowed to punish them for their guilt  but it is twice added  here and in v. 127  that they should show patience when they had the upper hand and do good even to their enemies  for allah is with those who do good  v. 128  . chapter 17 bamisraii the israelites this chapter opens and ends by referring to the history of the israelites  who  after attaining to greatness  were twice punished for their misdeeds . it begins with a mention of the mi raj or ascension of the holy prophet  indicative of the eminence to which the muslims would rise . it then warns muslims of the fate which befell the israelites  as the same fate was to befall them . then it goes on to deal with the following subjects  every deed must have a consequence  the moral teachings muslims must follow to do good deeds  opposition to the truth and to the righteous  and its defeat by the truth â€ ” that  truth  being the holy prophet himself who is the  spirit of truth  prophesied in the gospel of john â€ ” the quran being a miracle  and  finally  moses  warning to pharaoh  a warning like it now being given by the quran to its opponents . this chapter was revealed in the early period at makkah  around the fifth year of the holy prophet s mission . section 1  israelites punished twice in the name of allah  the beneficent  the merciful . â£ 1 glory be to him who carried his servant by night from the â « â– sacred mosque to the remote mosque  whose precincts we uâ » blessed  that we might show him some of our signs   surely he is the hearing  the seeing . 2 and we gave moses the book and made it a guidance to the a  1  the carrying by night of the holy prophet muhammad from the sacred mosque at makkah to the remote mosque at jerusalem  known as isrd   is in reference to the prophet s reported ascension  known as mi raj  . isrd  was the first stage in mi raj  as before his ascension to heaven  the prophet was taken to the remote mosque  or the temple at jerusalem . the ascension was not a trans lation of the body  but the spiritual experience of the holy prophet  as is shown in v. 60 where it is expressly called a vision . as the significance of the ascension was the spiritual eminence of the holy prophet and indicated his triumph in the world  his being carried to the temple at jerusalem signified that he would also inherit the blessings of the israelite prophets . 339 340 17 . the israelites â€¢ 17  3 children of israel  saying   take no guardian beside me a â€ ” 3  you  the offspring of those whom we bore with noah . surely he was a grateful servant . 4 and we made known to the children of israel in the book  certainly you will make mischief in the land twice  and behave insolently with mighty arrogance .  5 so when the first warning of the two came to pass  we raised against you our servants  of mighty prowess  so they made havoc in  your  houses . and it was an accomplished threat . then we gave you back the turn against them  and aided you with wealth and chil dren and made you a numerous band . c 7 if you do good  you do good for your own souls . and if you do evil  it is for them . so when the second warning came   we raised another people  that they might bring you to grief and that they might enter the mosque as they entered it the first time  and that they might destroy  what ever they conquered  with utter destruction 8 it may be that your lord will have mercy on you . and if you return  to mischief   we a  2  the first verse really prophesies a great future for islam and the muslims  while this warns them of the pitfalls of greatness  citing the instance of a nation that had been made to rise to eminence before them . b  4  jerusalem was destroyed twice as a punishment for the transgressions of the jews  once by the babylonians  and again by the romans . see jesus  warning in matthew 2338 and luke 2124 and various other like references . the psalms are also replete with warnings . c  6  v. 5 relates the destruction of the temple at jerusalem and the murder  imprisonment  and banishment of the jews by the babylonians in the year 588 b.c.  while v. 6 relates to the return of the jews and rebuilding of the temple under zerubbabel  and to their subsequent prosperity . d  7  this verse describes the destruction of the temple a second time  which was accomplished by the romans under titus . there is a prophetical reference here to the history of the muslims . the caliphate of islam was des troyed twice  first by the mongols under hulagu in 656 a.h.  1258 c.e .   and again by the powers of europe after the first world war . but while in the case of the israelites their spiritual centre was laid waste on both occasions  the spiritual centre of islam  the kabah  has remained intact on both occasions under a divine promise . following the first great reverse in muslim history in 1258  islam gained spiritual conquests in the coming over to islam en masse of the mongols and turks . after the second reverse  the afflictions of islam are giving birth to a spiri tual resuscitation of the world . on both occasions  there has been a revival of its temporal power as well . 179  every deed has a consequence 341 will return  to punishment  .  and we have made hell a prison for the disbelievers . 9 surely this quran guides to what is most upright  and gives good news to the believers who do good that theirs is a great reward  10 and that those who do not believe in the hereafter  we have prepared for them a painful punishment . section 2  every deed has a consequence 11 and man prays for evil as he ought to pray for good  and man is ever hasty . 12 and we made the night and the day two signs  then we have made the sign of the night to pass away and we have made the sign of the day manifest  so that you may seek grace from your lord  and that you may know the numbering of years and the reckoning . and we have explained everything distinctly . 13 and we have made every human being s actions to cling to his neck  and we shall bring forth to him on the day of resurrection a book which he will find wide open. 14 read your book . your own soul is sufficient as a reckoner against you this day . 15 whoever goes aright  goes aright only for the good of his own soul  and whoever goes astray  goes astray only to its detriment . and no bearer of a burden can bear the burden a  8  this relates to the advent of the holy prophet muhammad  when the israelites were again given a chance to reform  but they are told that if they return to mischief they will again be punished . b  12  the night stands for the darkness of ignorance and unbelief  see 2257   and the passing away of the night indicates that ignorance will vanish and the light of islam will take its place . arabia witnessed this sign in the seventh cen tury c.e.  and islam has since then been gradually advancing in the world . c  13  this verse reveals the principle that every action produces an effect which is made to cling to a person  and that this very effect will be met with on the day of resurrection in the form of a wide open book . it is thus by leaving its effect behind that every action is recorded  and this very effect constitutes the book of a person s actions . clinging to the neck indicates the inseparability of one thing from another  thus establishing the law of cause and effect . d  14  this verse throws a flood of light on the nature of the reckoning on the day of resurrection  showing clearly that it is nothing but a complete manifes tation of the effects of the deeds done in this life . 342 17 . the israelites â€¢ 17  16 of another .  nor do we punish until we raise a messenger . 16 and when we wish to destroy a town  we send command ments to its people who lead easy lives  but they transgress therein  thus the word proves true against it  so we destroy it with utter destruction 17 and how many generations did we destroy after noah  and your lord is sufficient as being aware and seer of his servants  sins . 18 whoever desires this transitory life  we hasten to him in it what we please for whomsoever we desire  then we assign to him hell  he will enter it despised  driven away . 19 and whoever desires the hereafter and strives for it with due striving and is a believer â€ ” those are they whose striving is amply rewarded . 20 a11 do we aid â€ ” these as well as those â€ ” out of the bounty of your lord  and the bounty of your lord is not limited . 21 see how we have made some of them to excel others . and certainly the hereafter is greater in degrees and greater in excellence . 22 do not set up any other god with allah  or you will sit down despised  forsaken . section 3  moral precepts 23 and your lord has decreed that you serve none but him  and do good to parents . if either or both of them reach old age a  151  this verse strikes at the root of the doctrine of atonement . the burden of the sins of one person can not be taken away by another  for  as already stated  the effect of each man s actions clings to himself . b  152  here it is stated that guidance is offered to man through a messen ger of god  but if he still persists in error and strays from the path  it is to his own detriment . and then it is added that the punishment of the hereafter is only after man has been warned through a divine messenger . the law as to punishment in this world is stated in v. 16  which speaks of the destruction of towns  for such punishment is sent when tyranny and transgression assume extraordinary propor tions  and punishment is then inflicted on large numbers . c  16  allah does not command people to transgress . the meaning is clear  allah sends them commandments to do good  pointing out the right way through his prophets  but as they are accustomed to lead easy lives  they transgress those commandments  and are therefore punished . d  23  doing good to parents is placed next to submission to allah  for among fellowbeings none has a greater claim upon a person than his parents . 17  24 â€¢ moral precepts 343 with you  say no word to them showing annoyance  nor rebuke them  and speak to them a generous word . 24 and make yourself gentle to them with humility out of mercy  and say  my lord  have mercy on them  as they brought me up  when i was  little . 25 your lord knows best what is in your minds . if you are righteous  he is surely forgiving to those who turn  to him  . 26 and give to the near of kin his due and  to  the needy and the traveller  and do not squander wastefully . 27 surely the squanderers are the devil s brethren . and the devil is ever ungrateful to his lord .  28 and if you  have to  turn away from them  in order  to seek mercy from jour lord that you hope for  then speak to them a gentle word .  29 and do not make your hand to be chained to your neck  nor stretch it forth to its fullest extension  so that you sit down blamed  stripped off . c 30 surely your lord amplifies provision for whom he pleases  and restricts  it also  . surely he is ever aware  seer  of his servants . section 4  moral precepts 31 and do not kill your children for fear of poverty â€ ” we provide for them and for you . surely the killing of them is a great wrong . 32 and do not go near to fornication  surely it is an a  27  while enjoining charity  the quran also draws attention to economy  thus indicating the golden mean . those who waste wealth are called the devil s brethren  because they are ungrateful to god for wasting away what he has given them out of his grace . b  28  hoping for mercy from the lord means standing in need of the bounty of the lord  i.e.  not having anything to give to the needy . in that case one should still speak to the needy gently . a saying of the holy prophet declares a gentle word spoken to someone to be a deed of charity  bukhari  5672  . c  29  by the hand being tied to the neck is meant being miserly  and by stretching it forth to its fullest extension is meant being wasteful . the verse teaches that the middle path should be adopted in one s ordinary expenses . rf  31  infanticide  in the case of daughters  was met with among the arabs  but this was not for fear of poverty . since the word children  aulad  includes both males and females  the killing of children here may mean not giving them proper education  ignorance  or intellectual death  being treated as death .  editor s note  abortion without a medical reason may also be included here .  344 17 . the israelites â€¢ 17  33 obscenity . and evil is the way .  33 and do not kill the soul which allah has forbidden except for a just cause . and whoever is killed unjustly  we have indeed given to his heir authority â€ ” but let him not exceed the limit in killing . surely he will be helped . 34 and do not draw near to the orphan s property  except in the best way  till he attains his maturity . and fulfil the promise  surely the promise will be enquired into . 35 and give full measure when you measure out  and weigh with a true balance . this is fair and better in the end . 36 and do not follow that of which you have no knowledge surely the hearing and the sight and the heart  all of these will be asked about it . 37 and do not go about in the land exultingly  for you can not split the earth  nor reach the mountains in height . 38 a11 this  the evil of it  is hateful in the sight of your lord . 39 this is from the wisdom which your lord has revealed to you . and do not set up with allah any other god  or you would be thrown into hell  blamed  cast away . 40 has then your lord pre ferred to give you sons  and  for himself  taken daughters from among the angels  surely you utter a terrible saying . section 5  disbelievers grow harder 41 and certainly we have repeated  warnings  in this quran that they may be mindful . and it only adds to their aversion . a  32  the quran not only forbids all outofwedlock sex  but enjoins people not to go near it  thus avoiding all those opportunities which are likely to tempt one to fall into the evil . hence it is that islam discourages the too free inter mingling of the sexes . b  33  the words he will be helped indicate that as the state is bound to help him by bringing the murderer within reach of the law  the heir should not take the law into his own hands . this is called exceeding the limits . c  36  if this injunction were followed  all society gossip would immediately cease  relieving many innocent people of the heartburning which they suffer on account of evil and unfounded reports . the verse also forbids entering into dis cussions without accurate knowledge  or putting forward uncertain opinion . rf  41  allah s purpose in repeating arguments and signs in the quran is to make people mindful  but the more they are reminded  the greater is their aversion to it . 1742  disbelievers grow harder 345 42 say  if there were with him gods  as they say  then certainly they would have been able to seek a way to the lord of the throne .  43 glory be to him  and he is supremely exalted above what they say  44 the seven heavens and the earth and those in them declare his glory . and there is not a single thing but glorifies him with his praise  but you do not understand their glorification . surely he is forbearing  forgiving . 45 and when you recite the quran  we place between you and those who do not believe in the hereafter a hidden barrier  c 46 and we put coverings on their hearts and a deafness in their ears that they may not understand it  and when you mention your lord alone in the quran  they turn their backs in aversion . 47 we know best what they listen to when they listen to you  and when they take counsel secretly  when the wrongdoers say  you follow only a man deprived of reason . 48 see  what they liken you to  so they have gone astray  and can not find the way . 49 and they say  when we are bones and decayed particles  shall we then be raised up as a new creation  s0 say  be stones or iron  51 or some other creature of those which are too hard  to a  42  the idolworshippers were sunk deep in vices and immorality  while access to the divine being â€ ” a way to the lord of the throne â€ ” which they claimed they got through their idols  should have purified their lives . or  the meaning is that  if they had access to god  who holds all power in his hands  they should have received divine help and been successful in uprooting islam . b  44  the whole universe is here mentioned as declaring the glory of allah  which means declaring god to be free from every imperfection and impurity  or from everything derogatory to his dignity . this declaration need not be with the tongue and in words  in fact  the very dependence of the whole creation on the creator and its consequent imperfection is a glorification of the creator . c  45  this hidden barrier is nothing but that erected by their own aversion  as plainly indicated in v. 41. d  46  the placing of coverings on the hearts and deafness in the ears of the disbelievers is no doubt attributed to allah as the prime cause of all things  but this covering and deafness is directly brought about because they do not even listen to the mention of allah  and flee in aversion from his word . allah brings it about on account of the condition of their very hearts and ears . see also 7179 . 346 17 . the israelites â€¢ 17  52 receive life  in your minds  a but they will say  who will return us  say  he who created you at first . still they will shake their heads at you and say  when will it be  say  maybe it has drawn near . 52 0n the day when he will call you forth  then will you obey him  giving him praise  and you will think that you remain ed only a little  while  . section 6  punishment must follow 53 and say to my servants that they speak what is best . surely the devil sows dissensions among them . the devil is surely an open enemy to man . c 54 your lord knows you best . he will have mercy on you  if he please  or he will punish you  if he please . and we have not sent you as being in charge of them . 55 and your lord best knows those who are in the heavens and the earth . and certainly we made some of the prophets to excel others  and to david we gave the zabur . e a  511  they are told that a life after death must follow even if they could change themselves into stones . and the spiritual life with which they were quick ened by the holy prophet  despite their hardheartedness â€ ”  they were like rocks  rather worse in hardness   274  â€ ” was a clear proof of this . b  512  the answer  maybe it has drawn near  refers to the spiritual resusci tation of arabia  which was now to be accomplished through the holy prophet  as an indication of the greater resurrection . the next verse makes it clear  then will you obey him  giving him praise . fifteen years after this the whole of arabia re sounded with divine praises . c  53  the muslims â€ ” my servants â€ ” are here enjoined to be very kind when they speak to the disbelievers . it is related that when the muslims com plained to the holy prophet that they were abused by the idolaters  they were told to be kind and not to retaliate . it was the devil that was causing these quarrels . the words evidently imply that these dissensions were only transient  and that the two parties would again become united . d  54  in this verse  as elsewhere in the quran  mercy is mentioned first  thus showing that divine mercy has precedence over divine retribution . e  55  by saying that some of the prophets are made to excel others  the excellence of the holy prophet over others is implied . david is specially men tioned  because  as stated in the psalms  called here zabur   he prayed for the utter destruction of his enemies  whereas the two previous verses show that the holy prophet was enjoined to deal mercifully with his opponents . 17  56 â€¢ punishment must follow 347 56 say  call on those whom you assert besides him  they have no power to remove distress from you nor to change . 57 those whom they call upon  themselves seek the means of access to their lord â€ ” whoever of them is nearest â€ ” and they hope for his mercy and fear his punishment . surely the punishment of your lord is a thing to be cautious of .  58 and there is not a town but we will destroy it before the day of resurrection or punish it with a severe punishment . that is written in the book . 59 and nothing hindered us from sending signs  but the ancients rejected them . c and we gave to thamud the shecamel  a manifest sign  but they did her wrong  and we send signs only to warn . 60 and when we said to you  surely jour lord encompasses people . and we made the vision which we showed you only a a  57  these divinities  it is argued  themselves hoped for divine mercy and feared his retribution  the nearer a person to the divine being  the greater was his hope of mercy and his fear of punishment if he disobeyed . b  58  there is a prophetical reference here to great disasters which would ruin populous towns . the words  before the day of resurrection  clearly show that the destruction of the towns does not refer to the end of things . already we have seen the fulfilment of this prophecy in the destruction of populous towns in almost every country of the world on an unprecedented scale  but it is nothing compared with the havoc which the atomic bomb and other inventions of this modern age are likely to work  if the mad struggle for power is not ended . it should be noted that the prophecy of the ruination of populous towns is here mentioned as a part of the divine scheme in the ultimate triumph of islam with which this chapter deals  and hence the reference to the sending of signs in v. 59. c  59  after speaking of a great sign in the latter days  the destruction of towns on a large scale  this verse speaks of a general law that god has always been sending signs to establish truth  and that nothing ever hindered him from sending signs  though such signs were rejected by the people to whom they were sent . it is further made clear that signs are sent to warn people of the evil consequences of doing evil . rf  60l  the reference here is to the vision of ascension or the mi raj  bukhari  6342   which was really a prophecy of the ultimate triumph of islam . in a hadith report the words describing the condition in which the holy prophet was at the time of this ascension are  whilst i was in a state between that of one sleep ing and one awake  bukhari  596  . thus it was not an ascension of the body . although he was not asleep he was in a vision . he was actually carried to the holy presence  and he was shown great wonders  but it was in spirit that he was 348 17 . the israelites â€¢ 17  61 trial for people  as also the tree cursed in the quran .  and we warn them  but it only adds to their great inordinacy . section 7  the devil s opposition to the righteous 61 and when we said to the angels  be submissive to adam  they submitted  but not iblts . he said  shall i submit to him whom you have created of dust  62 he said  do you see  this is he whom you have honoured above me  if you grant me respite to the day of resurrection  i will certainly cause his progeny to perish except a few . 63 he said  go away  whoever of them follows you surely hell is your recompense  a full recompense . 64 and incite whoever of them you can with jour voice  c and collect against them your horse  men  and your foot  soldiers   and share with them in wealth and children  6 and promise them . and the devil promises them only to deceive . 65 my servants â€ ” you have surely no authority carried  and it was with the spiritual eye that he saw those wonders  not in body and with the physical eye  for things spiritual can only be seen with the spiritual eye . this vision had an important significance . he saw it at a time when his con dition was one of utmost helplessness  and he was shown that a great future lay before him . his opponents  as usual  disbelieved in such visions  and laughed at him . a  602  as the holy prophet s vision signified his future triumph and gave an indication of the greatness to which islam would rise  the statement made else where that the tree oizaqqiim was the food of sinners  444344  contained a pro phecy of the discomfiture of the enemies of islam  telling them that a deadly food was in store for them . the reason why the vision and the statement about the cursed tree are conjoined is that the triumph of islam and the discomfiture of the enemy went hand in hand . b  61  see 234 and 712. c  641  the devil is here compared with a coward who comes with great show but little real force  and who  if shown the least resistance  retreats at every step . every inviter who invites people to the disobedience of allah is such a devil . d  642  the forces of the devil are no other than the evildoers  those going quickly into evil being likened to horsemen and those who walk slowly in their evil course being likened to infantry . e  643  the sharing of the devil in wealth signifies everything spent or acquired unlawfully and sharing in children is in reference to committing forni cation . 1766  opposition to the prophet 349 over them .  and your lord is sufficient as having charge of affairs . 66 your lord is he who speeds the ships for you in the sea that you may seek of his grace . surely he is ever merciful to you . 67 and when distress afflicts you in the sea  away go those whom you call on except he  but when he brings you safe to the land  you turn away . and man is ever ungrateful .  68 do you then feel secure that he will not bring you low on a tract of land  or send on you a violent wind  c then you will not find a protector for your selves  69 or  do you feel secure that he will not take you back into it another time  then send on you a fierce gale and thus overwhelm you for your ungratefulness  then you will not find any aider against us in the matter . 70 and surely we have honoured the children of adam  and we carry them in the land and the sea  and we provide them with good things  and we have made them to excel highly most of those whom we have created . section 8  opposition to the prophet 71 on the day when we shall call every people with their leader  then whoever is given his book in his right hand  these will read their book  and they will not be dealt with unjustly in the least . 6 72 and whoever is blind in this  world  he will be blind a  65  my servants may include all human beings . the devil will say to the sinners  i had no authority over you  1422  . b  67  a true picture is drawn here of human nature  which turns to allah in affliction but forgets him in ease . c  68  it was by a violent wind that the combined forces of all the enemies of islam were brought low in the battle of the allies  when  besieging madinah in the year 5 a.h.  they had to flee in disorder . d  711  the meaning is that the righteous will follow the righteous leaders and the wicked will follow their wicked leaders . the word imam  or leader  here is interpreted in several other ways  meaning scripture  prophet  law  book of deeds . the last of these significances also suits the context  as the books of deeds are spoken of in the words that follow . e  712  this book is the one mentioned in v. 14  i.e.  the effect of one s deeds  which will be brought before everyone in a palpable form on the day 350 17 . the israelites â€¢ 17  73 in the hereafter  and further away from the path .  73 and surely they had purposed to turn you away from what we have revealed to you  that you should forge against us  some revelation  other than that  and then they would have taken you for a friend . 74 and if we had not made you firm  you might have indeed inclined to them a little  75 then we would have made you taste a double  punishment  in life and a double  punishment  after death  and then you would not have found any helper against us . 76 and surely they purposed to unsettle you from the land that they might expel you from it  and then they will not remain after you but a little while . c 77  this is our  way with our messengers whom we sent before you  and you will not find a change in our course . section 9  truth will prevail 78 keep up prayer from the declining of the sun till the darkness of the night  and the recital of the quran at dawn . surely of resurrection . the book of deeds is given in the right hand to those who hold the book of god in their right hands here  i.e.  act upon it . as against them are those spoken of in the next verse  they remain blind to the book of god  so they will be blind in the hereafter . a  72  those who remain blind to truth in this life remain blind in the life after death  which shows that it is here that a hellish life begins with spiritual blindness  and that the hell of the next life is also a blindness . this is corroborated by what is said in 5712  that the faithful will have a light on that day . b  73  this refers to an incident at makkah when the chief men of the quraish offered to give the prophet wealth or to make him their king  if he gave up speaking against their idols and their evil ways . the prophet s reply was that he wanted neither of these things  but that it was for their welfare that he asked them to give up evil ways . c  76  when the opponents failed to make the prophet swerve from the path of truth  they planned to expel him from the land  though they were told before hand that in that case they themselves would not retain power but for a short time . it was only eight years after the hijrah that the prophet entered makkah as a conqueror . rf  77  this law is also stated in 141314 . 1 7  79 â€¢ truth will prevail 351 the recital of the quran at dawn is witnessed .  79 and during a part of the night  keep awake by it  beyond what is incumbent on you  maybe jour lord will raise you to a position of great glory . e 80 and say  my lord  make me enter a truthful entering  and make me go forth a truthful exit  and grant me from your presence an authority to help  me  . 81 and say  the truth has come and false hood vanished . surely falsehood is ever bound to vanish . 2 a  78  after describing how the opponents wanted to bring the prophet s mission to failure by various means  the prophet is told to resort to prayer as a solution of the great difficulties he faced . from the declining of the sun to sunset are zuhr and asr  or the early and late afternoon prayers  while from sunset till darkness are maghrib and isha   or the sunset prayer and the prayer at nightfall . the fifth is the morning prayer  which is called here qur an alfajr  or the recital of the quran at dawn . thus this verse  which is one of the very early revelations  mentions all the five prayers . b  791  this refers to the tahajjud prayer  whose name is derived from the words  keep awake   fatahajjad  . the time for this prayer is the latter portion of the night in the early hours . it is not an obligatory prayer but  as stated here  it is the means of raising a man to a position of great glory . the time at which it is said is most suited for the concentration of mind and for communion with god . c  792  the man whom the opponents had planned to expel from their city as a helpless man was to be raised to a position of eminent dignity through prayer to god  the tahajjud prayer in the night in particular . as time passes on  the prophet is ever rising to positions of greater and greater glory . but while the verse speaks in particular of the prophet and of the great glory to which he was destined to rise  it gives a promise in general as well that whoever is sincere in calling upon god  especially at night  is raised to a position of glory . rf  80  the reference here is a prophecy of the prophet s flight  entering madinah and going forth from makkah . but the words are also general  man being taught here to pray that his entering into any affair and his exit may be marked by truthfulness  and that he may be granted divine help in all his under takings . e  81  the advent of the prophet is here spoken of as the advent of the truth  in reference to the prophecy in john 1613   however  when he  the spirit of truth  has come  he will guide you into all truth  for he will not speak on his own authority  but whatever he hears he will speak  and he will tell you things to come .  the vanishing of falsehood is here spoken of in the past tense to indicate the certainty of its occurrence . falsehood finally disappeared from makkah when the prophet entered it as a conqueror  and as the house of the holy one was cleared of the idols  the prophet recited this verse  the truth has come and false hood vanished  bukhari  4632   thus showing that he understood it to contain the 352 17 . the israelites â€¢ 17  82 82 and the quran that we reveal is a healing and a mercy to the believers  and it only increases the wrongdoers in loss . a 83 and when we bestow favours on man  he turns away and behaves proudly  and when evil afflicts him  he is in despair . 84 say  every one acts according to his manner . but your lord best knows who is best guided on the path . section 10  the quran â€ ” a unique guidance 85 and they ask you about the revelation say  the reve lation is by the commandment of my lord  and you are not given knowledge but a little . 86 and if we please  we could certainly take away what we have revealed to you  then you would find none to plead  your cause  against us â€ ” 87 but it is a mercy from your lord . surely his bounty to you is abundant . 88 say  if people and jinn should combine together to bring the like of this quran  they could not bring the like of it  though they helped one another . 89 and certainly we have made clear for prophecy of the conquest of makkah . the statement made here  however  is general and it means that falsehood can not stand before truth and that truth must finally prevail in the whole world . a  82  the quran is here called a healing and a mercy for spiritual diseases  and history bears testimony that spiritual diseases were all swept away by the quran . but  it is added  it is a healing for the believers who follow it  and not for those who reject it  and its rejection brings only greater loss . b  84  both the believer and the disbeliever act according to the rules of con duct which they have set before themselves . who is on the right path is made clear by the consequences which appear later but which are always known to god . c  85  the word ruh means inspiration or revelation as well as spirit . here  before this verse as well as after it  the quran is the only topic of discussion  and therefore the context shows clearly that the question of the disbelievers is not about the soul of man  but about the quran itself . rf  88  see 223 and 1113 footnote . out of the four places in which the disbelievers are challenged to produce the like of the quran  this is the only one where the jinn and the people are spoken of together  in all the other places the shuhada   meaning helpers  leaders or their great men  take the place of the jinn . this shows that the word jinn is used in the quran for the leaders of evil . 17  90 â€¢ justice of retribution 353 people in this quran every kind of description  but most people consent only to denying . 90 and they say  we will by no means believe in you  till you cause a spring to gush forth from the earth for us  91 or   ou have a garden of palms and grapes in the midst of which you cause rivers to flow forth abundantly  92 or you cause the heaven to come down upon us in pieces  as you think  or bring allah and the angels face to face  with us   93 or you have a house of gold  or you ascend into heaven . and we will not believe in your ascending till you bring down to us a book we can read . say  glory be to my lord  am i anything but a mortal messenger  c section 1 1  justice of retribution 94 and nothing prevents people from believing  when the guidance comes to them  except that they say  has allah raised up a mortal to be a messenger  95 say  if there had been in the earth angels walking about secure  we would have sent down to them from the heaven an angel as messenger . 96 say  allah is sufficient for a witness between me and you . surely he is ever aware of his servants  seer  of them  . 97 and he whom allah guides  he is on the right way  and he whom he leaves in error  for them you will find no guardians besides him . and we shall gather them together on the day of resurrection on their faces  blind and dumb and deaf . their abode is hell . whenever it abates  we make them burn the more . a  89  it is here affirmed that all that contributes to the moral and spiritual welfare of man is made distinct in the quran . b  90  the signs demanded in this and the following three verses relate to the promises made for the righteous and the threats of punishment for the wicked  and they were no doubt fulfilled in due time . but the disbelievers wanted to see the spiritual blessings of communion with god in a physical shape . the believers were granted gardens with rivers running in them even in this life  and punishment from heaven overtook the opponents  but this was to come about gradually . c  93  the answer to all the demands of the disbelievers is that the prophet was only a mortal messenger  and the prophecies regarding his own great future or the discomfiture of his enemies would be brought to fulfilment gradually  as in the case of messengers before him . 354 17 . the israelites â€¢ 17  98 98 this is their retribution because they disbelieve in our messages and say  when we are bones and decayed particles  shall we then be raised up into a new creation   do they not see that allah  who created the heavens and the earth  is able to create the like of them  and he has appointed for them a term  of which there is no doubt . but the wrongdoers consent only to denying . 100 say  if you control the treasures of the mercy of my lord  then you would withhold  them  for fear of spending . and man is ever miserly . section 12  comparison with moses 101 and certainly we gave moses nine clear signs  so ask the children of israel . when he came to them  pharaoh said to him  surely i think you  moses  to be one bewitched . 102 he said  truly you know that none but the lord of the heavens and the earth has sent these as clear proofs  and surely i believe you  pharaoh  to be lost . 103 so he desired to scare them from the land  but we drowned him and those with him  all together  104 and we said to the children of israel after him  abide in the land . but when the latter promise came  we brought you all rolled up .  105 and with truth have we revealed it  and with truth did it come . and we have not sent you but as a giver of good news and as a warner . 106 and it is a quran we have made distinct  so that you may read it to the people by slow degrees  and we have revealed it in portions . 107 say  believe in it or do not believe . surely those who are given the knowledge before it  fall down prostrate on their faces  when it is recited to them  108 and they say  glory be to our lord  surely the promise of our lord was to be fulfilled .  109 and they fall a  104  the latter promise here relates to the promise given to moses for the raising up of another prophet like him . this is corroborated by what is said in the next verse about the revelation of the quran  which came with truth  i.e.  in fulfil ment of a true promise . by the rolling up of the israelites is meant that they would make way for another people  who would inherit the kingdom of god . b  108  the promise spoken of here is no doubt the promise given to the former prophets regarding the advent of the holy prophet  and by knowledge in the previous verse is also meant knowledge of the prophecies . 17110 comparison with mo ses 355 down on their faces  weeping  and it adds to their humility . no say  call on allah or call on the beneficent . a by whatever  name  you call on him  he has the best names . and do not be loud in your prayer nor be silent in it  and seek a way between these . m and say  praise be to allah  who has not taken to him self a son  and who does not have a partner in the kingdom  and who does not have a helper because of weakness  and proclaim his greatness  magnifying  him  . a  1101  the name rahman  beneficent  seems to have been particularly objectionable to the arabs  who objected to its use even so late as the truce at hudaibiyah . the christians also do not recognize allah to be rahman  because it means that allah shows mercy to his creatures without their having done any thing to deserve it  while the christian doctrine of atonement is based on the belief that allah can not show mercy to his creatures without receiving some satisfac tion . b  1102  the two extremes with regard to prayer are its utterance in a very loud voice or not uttering any word at all with the tongue  thinking that god knows what is in the hearts . muslims are told to take the middle course between the two extremes . utterance of words makes the prayer go deeper down into the heart of man  and thus makes it more effective . chapter 18 aikahf the cave this chapter deals with both the early state of christianity  when it was under persecution and practised renunciation of the world  and prophetically with its latterday condition when christian nations have acquired unsurpassed material dominance in the world . it is called the cave because early chris tians sought refuge in such places from persecution and practised monkery in solitude . in the first as well as the last section the doctrine of the divine sonship of jesus is denounced  v. 4  v. 102  and the purely material engross ment of these nations is prophesied to lead to material and spiritual failure  v. 78  v. 103104  . in between  the chapter treats the following subjects  a story from early christianity of the dwellers of the cave  containing propheti cal allusions to its later history  rejection of the truth by those who possess wealth and power  the guilty being brought to judgment  a story of moses  search for knowledge and finding a man of god superior to him in know ledge  indicating the coming of islam  and a story of king darius i and his efforts to repel the two tribes of gog and magog  which again contains a pro phetical allusion to the rise and dominance of modern western nations . this chapter was revealed in the early period at makkah . section 1  a warning to the christians in the name of allah  the beneficent  the merciful . 1 praise be to allah  who revealed the book to his servant  and did not allow in it any crookedness  2 rightly directing   to give warning of severe punishment from him and to give good news to the believers who do good that theirs is a goodly reward  3 staying in it forever  4 and to warn those who say  allah has taken to him self a son . 5 they have no knowledge of it  nor had their fathers . grievous is the word that comes out of their mouths . they speak a  2  the quran is here described as possessing two qualifications . the first refers to its own perfection  there is no crookedness in it  and the second speaks of it as a book suited to make others perfect  for it is called qayyim  as meaning one that rightly directs others . 356 186â « a warning to the christians 357 nothing but a lie.  6 then perhaps you will kill yourself with grief  sorrowing after them  if they do not believe in this announce ment . 7 surely we have made whatever is on the earth an embellish ment for it  so that we may try which of them is best in works . 8 and we shall surely make what is on it dust  without vegetation a  5  the holy prophet is reported to have said  he who remembers the first ten verses of the chapter entitled the cave is protected from the tribulation of dajjal  the antichrist   sahih muslim  642  . in another report the last ten verses of the cave instead of the first ten are mentioned  abu dawud  3612  . now in the first and the last sections of this chapter the christian doctrine of the divinity of jesus is condemned . in the first section a warning is given to those who say allah has taken to himself a son  v. 4   in the last two to those who take my ser vants to befriends besides me  v. 102   and this doctrine  the doctrine of sonship and of the divinity of a servant of god  is the basic doctrine of the christian reli gion . moreover  in the concluding ten verses  a true description of the occupation of christian nations is given in the words whose effort goes astray in this world s life  v. 104  . the holy prophet s saying quoted above plainly shows that the dajjal of the hadith is the same as the upholders of the erroneous christian doc trine of the sonship and divinity of jesus christ . christianity  in its present form  being opposed to the true teachings of christ  is thus the only antichrist known to the quran . b  6  the anxiety which the holy prophet felt on account of a fallen huma nity was so great that he is spoken of here as almost killing himself with grief . his was a life of absolute devotion to the cause of humanity  his only concern being that man should rise to the true dignity for which god had made him . this anxiety was not only for those who were directly addressed by him  but  as the context shows  it was as deep for another people  who attributed a son to the divine being  and whom outward finery was to mislead to such an extent as to make them strangers to spiritual truth . reading the next verse leaves no doubt that the prophet was shown the earthly embellishments which are so great a trial for christendom today . the word announcement here refers to the quran . c  8  the picture drawn here is of the beautiful cities of the modern age  with all their attractions and luxuries  which so engross people that they neither pay attention to the preaching of truth nor to the pursuit of righteousness . the earth will be first beautified to its utmost  we are told here  and then laid waste  by man s own hands  lofty buildings being reduced to dust and beautiful gardens being turned into bare earth without any vegetation on it . all prophecies made known through the righteous servants of god  the prophets of the old testament and jesus christ  and then through the quran and the hadith  point to worldwide conflicts in the latter days  of nation rising against nation  and of destruction of 358 18 . the cave 189 9 0r  do you think that the companions of the cave and the inscrip tion were from among our wonderful signs   10 when the youths sought refuge in the cave  they said  our lord  grant us mercy from yourself  and provide for us a right course in our affair . n so we prevented them from hearing in the cave for a number of years  4 12 then we raised them up that we might know which cities on a vast scale . science first embellished the earth and science is now turn ing it into a waste  by its atom bombs and other diabolic inventions . a  9  the cave stands for the christian institution of monkery  this being the distinctive characteristic which it assumed soon after its birth . raqim means an inscription or a tablet with a writing upon it . the inscription contains a propheti cal reference to an aspect of the christian religion quite opposed to its first aspect of growth in the cave . inscription  or advertisement  is  in fact  as prominent a feature of the business activities of the christian nations of today as the cave was a feature of their religious activities in the early days . the quran seems to have chosen the epithets to designate the christian nations by indicating their most pro minent characteristics in their early and their latter days . the account from here to v. 22 is generally identified with the memorable story of the  seven sleepers   christian youths who took refuge in a cave to escape the persecution of the roman emperor decius around the year 250 c.e . accord ing to the story  the emperor ordered the entrance to the cave to be blocked with stones . it is stated that the youths fell asleep as soon as they were shut up in the cave  and awoke 187 years after this in the reign of theodosius  some state 375 years   when the stones were removed to supply building material for some edifice . they then sent one of their number to bring food for them from the city  but he was taken to the judge on presenting a coin of the reign of decius  and thus the youths were discovered . the story as narrated in the quran does not credit the unnatural incidents of the above account . it only speaks of some men having taken refuge in a dark cave on account of a religious persecution  where and when it does not state . after they had rested for a part of a day  they made arrangements to get their food from outside  v. 19   and remained in this condition for  a number of years   v. 11   but were subsequently discovered  and an edifice being built at the mouth of the cave caused their death  v. 21  . it mentions conjectures as to their number and the number of years they remained in the cave  v. 22   but does not go beyond saying that there were some men who remained in the cave for some years . however  the story itself is not without a deeper meaning  and more state ments than one show that there is a reference to the history of christianity itself in the story . b  11  the meaning is that these people remained cut off from the rest of the world for a number of years . the quran does not support the story that they remained in the cave for hundreds of years or that they were asleep all this time . 18  13 â€¢ the dwellers in the cave 359 of the two parties was best able to calculate the time for which they remained .  section 2  the dwellers in the cave 13 we relate to you their story with truth . surely they were youths who believed in their lord and we increased them in guidance . 14 and we strengthened their hearts when they stood up and said  our lord is the lord of the heavens and the earth  we call upon no god beside him  for then indeed we should utter an enormity . 15 these our people have taken gods beside him . why do they not bring clear authority for them  who is then more unjust than he who forges a lie against allah  16 and when you withdraw from them and what they worship except allah  take refuge in the cave  your lord will spread forth for you some of his mercy  and provide for you a profitable course in your affair . 17 and you might see the sun  when it rose  decline from their cave to the right  and when it set leave them behind on the left  while they were in a wide space of it . c this is from among the signs of allah . he whom allah guides  he is on the right way  and whom he leaves in error  you will not find for him a friend to guide aright . section 3  the dwellers in the cave 18 and you might think them awake while they were asleep  and we turned them about to the right and to the left  with their a  12  the raising them up might signify raising them up from sleep  as also raising them up into a condition of activity  after their remaining cut off from the world  as stated in the previous verse . b  14  this is to show that the early followers of christianity were unitarians â€ ” believers in one god only . c  17  this describes the position of the cave  which was so situated that it did not admit sunshine . this could easily happen in a cave with its mouth to the north  situated in the northern hemisphere and above the tropic of cancer . with reference to the history of christianity it may indicate its coming to europe . 360 18 . the cave 1819 dog outstretching its paws at the entrance . if you looked at them  you would turn back from them in flight  and you would be filled with awe because of them .  19 and thus did we rouse them that they might question each other . a speaker from among them said  how long have you stayed  they said  we have stayed for a day or a part of a day .  others  said  your lord knows best how long you have stayed . now send one of you with this silver  coin  of yours to the city  then let him see what food is purest  and bring you provision from it  and let him behave with gentleness  and not make your case known to anyone . c 20 for if they prevail against you  they would stone you to death or force you back to their religion  and then you would never succeed . a  18  what is related in this section is clearly applicable to the story of the seven sleepers  as also to the later history of christianity . in the first case  the meaning is that the youths  who fled for fear of persecution and betook them selves to a cave  slept for some time with a dog at the door of the cave . the whole scene was rather aweinspiring  a dark cave  in some distant and uninhabited part of the country  with some men sleeping in it and a dog at the door . applied to the history of christianity the statement is equally true . in this case it should be borne in mind that ruqud   asleep   also means inactive or stagnant . similarly aiqaz   awake   means vigilant or wary . the turning about to the right and to the left  which signifies an uneasy condition while sleeping  may be used as expressing the activities of a man or a nation . thus there may be a reference here to the lethargy in which the christian nations remained for a long time  and to their subsequent going about in the world in all directions . it may also be noted that europeans are generally fond of dogs . b  191  this may refer either to the time for which the youths slept or to the centuries of inactivity of the christian nations . a day of a thousand years is spoken of in the quran  see 2247  etc .   and therefore the word day  applied to the history of a nation  may signify a thousand years . c  192  after having been refreshed with sleep  which might have been brought on by the fatigue of the journey  they thought of procuring food for them selves in that solitary cave and sent one of them to the city  and impressed on him that he should be gentle and should not give an inkling of their whereabouts to anyone . in reference to the history of christianity  this speaks of the commercial activities of the christian nations  i.e . in asia and africa  by means of which their rule was established . the words  and not make your case known to anyone  apply to their hidden intentions of gaining rule under the pretext of trade . â€ ” editor  1821  the dwellers in the cave 361 21 and thus did we make  people  to get knowledge of them   that they might know that allah s promise is true and that the hour â€ ” there is no doubt about it .  when they disputed among themselves about their affair and said  erect an edifice over them . c their lord knows best about them . those who prevailed in their affair said  we shall certainly build a place of worship over them . 22  some  say   they were  three  the fourth of them their dog  and  others  say  five  the sixth of them their dog  making conjectures about the unseen . and  others  say  seven  and the eighth of them their dog . say  my lord best knows their number â€ ” none knows them but a few . so do not contend in their matter but with a clear argument  and do not question any of them concerning them . 6 a  211  it was their going out to purchase food that brought them to the knowledge of the outside world . it is not stated how long they continued in this state . comparing this with v. 11  however  we may say that they passed several years in this condition . b  212  the result of their becoming known is described in words which show that they were put to death  because the promise of allah as to a future state of life is fully realized only after death . c  213  these words show that their death was brought about by closing the mouth of the cave . this is what is meant by the erection of an edifice over them . the words may also signify the erection of a monument . d  214  the people spoken of here are those who prevailed in their affair . this is a later incident  when christianity became the dominant religion of the roman empire  and the reference here seems to be to the saintworship which was prevalent in christianity . e  22  this verse and v. 25 show that these are only conjectures of the people with regard to them . their number and the number of years during which they remained in the cave are both matters which are said to be only known to allah . ibn abbas is  however  of the opinion that the words condemning the first two as conjectures show that the lastmentioned number  i.e.  seven  is correct .  editor s note  in his urdu commentary  maulana muhammad ali has applied this number to the number of western powers  whose number varies depending on whether they are counted individually or in groups according to their treaty alliances .  according to ibn jarir s commentary the people referred to in the concluding words  any of them  are the people of the book  or the christians . it is clear from this that it is really the history of christianity that is dealt with in the story of the companions of the cave . v. 25  which again speaks of the same people who are 362 18 . the cave 1823 section 4  the quran as a guidance 23 and do not say of anything  i will do that tomorrow  24 unless allah please .  and remember jour lord when you forget and say  maybe my lord will guide me to a nearer course to the right than this . 25 and they remained in their cave three hundred years  and they add nine . e 26 say  allah knows best how long they remained . his is the unseen of the heavens and the earth . how clear his sight and his hearing  there is no guardian for them beside him  and he takes none as partner in his judgment . 27 and recite what has been revealed to you of the book of spoken of here  makes it clear that it is the history of christianity that is really aimed at . a  241  though the words are general  there seems to be a special prophetic reference to the prophet s flight and his taking refuge in a cave . he had entirely to trust in allah  who was to bring it about as he thought best for him . b  242  the meaning is that the difficulties which had to be experienced by the dwellers in the cave would be removed from the prophet s way . he had to pass only three days in the cave  and though a powerful enemy exerted itself to its utmost  his hidingplace at only a distance of three miles from the city  whither food was conveyed to him  could not be discovered . or  in the nearer course there is a reference to the unprecedented triumph of islam  which spread over the whole of arabia within twentythree years  and spread from spain in the west to china in the east within a century  whereas christianity remained in a state of subjection in its birthplace for three hundred years  as stated in the verse that follows . c  25  the history of christianity  which runs like an undercurrent in the story of the companions of the cave  finds a clear expression now . there is no tradition that the companions of the cave remained in the cave for three hundred years  but christianity itself remained in a cave for full three hundred years . it is a fact that christianity rose to power with the conversion of constantine  and at the same time it lost its purity with the formulation of the doctrine of the trinity  which was promulgated in 325 c.e . it is  moreover  now almost agreed that jesus christ was born in 65 b.c . so if he began his ministry at the age of thirty  the christian religion may be said to have been born at about 25 c.e.  and thus exactly after three hundred years it lost its purity by the promulgation of the trinitarian doctrine  emerging at the same time as a state religion . thus it remained in the cave for three hundred years . as to adding nine years  to convert solar years to lunar years three years have to be added to every hundred years  and to the three centuries another nine years are thus added . 1828  a parable 363 jour lord . there is none who can alter his words . a and you will find no refuge beside him . 28 and keep yourself with those who call on their lord morning and evening desiring his goodwill  and let not your eyes pass from them  desiring the beauties of this world s life . and do not follow him whose heart we have made unmindful of our remembrance  and he follows his low desires and his case exceeds due bounds . 29 and say  the truth is from your lord  so whoever wishes  let him believe  and whoever wishes  let him disbelieve . surely we have prepared for the wrongdoers a fire  an enclosure of which will encompass them . and if they cry for water  they are given water like molten brass  scalding their faces . evil the drink  and ill the restingplace  30 as for those who believe and do good  we do not waste the reward of him who does a good work . 31 these it is for whom are gardens of perpetuity in which rivers flow  they are adorned therein with bracelets of gold  and they wear green robes of fine silk and thick brocade  reclining therein on raised couches . c excellent the recom pense  and goodly the restingplace  section 5  a parable 32 and set forth to them the parable of two men â€ ” for one of them we made two gardens of grapevines  and we surrounded a  27  by  words  are meant here prophecies  because it is the prophecy of the prophet s flight and his final triumph over his enemies that is referred to here . these prophecies  it is claimed  can not be altered by people  and they must come to pass  however great the opposing forces . b  29  they refused the water of spiritual life in this life  and so they will have no water to quench their thirst in the life after death . c  31  it is after these things that people hanker in this life  but the ornaments and robes of this life are transitory . the righteous  who in this life desire and struggle for only spiritual ornaments and moral beauty  find these visible in the afterlife . however  these prophecies were in one sense brought to fulfilment in this very life also . the arabs  whose only wealth consisted of their camels and horses  and whose clothes were made of skins or cloth of rough textures  found the treasures of rome and persia laid at their feet  and the bracelets of gold and the silk brocade interwoven with gold  which they had never seen before  were now brought to them in abundance  while the gardens of mesopotamia and persia were given to them for a permanent heritage . 364 18 . the cave 1833 them with datepalms  and between them we made cornfields.  33 both these gardens yielded their fruits  and did not fail in this at all  and we caused a river to gush forth in their midst  34 and he had fruit . so he said to his companion  while arguing with him  i have more wealth than you  and am greater in followers . 35 and he went into his garden  while he was unjust to himself . he said  i do not think that this will ever perish  36 and i do not think the hour will come  and even if i am returned to my lord  i will certainly find a better place of return than this . 37 his companion said to him  while arguing with him  do you disbelieve in him who created you of dust  then of a small life germ  then he made you a perfect man  38 but as for me  he  allah  is my lord  and i set up none as partner with my lord . 39 and why did you not say  when you entered your garden  it is as allah has pleased â€ ” there is no power except in allah  if you consider me as less than you in wealth and children â€ ” 40 then maybe my lord will give me better than your garden  and will send on  yours  a reckoning from heaven so that it is dust without plant  41 or its water will sink down into the ground  so that you are unable to find it . 42 and his fruit was destroyed  so he began to wring his hands for what he had spent on it  as it lay waste  its roofs fallen down  c and he said  ah me  i wish i had not set up any partner with my lord  43 and he had no forces to help him against allah  nor could he defend himself . 44 thus protection is only allah s  the true one . he is best to  give  reward and best for  determining  the final end . a  32  the parable set forth here is undoubtedly to illustrate the condition of the christian and the muslim nations . the former received an abundance of the wealth of this life  as is indicated by the gardens of the parable  while the latter  though poorer in worldly possessions  were richer in the heavenly blessings of allah . the former reject the message of truth  of which the latter are the bearers  and their vaunt is the same as that of the wealthy man in the parable   have more wealth than you  and am greater in followers  v. 34  . b  36  by the  hour  is meant the hour of doom which must overtake every people who reject the truth . c  42  here we have an exact description of the havoc that is being wrought in the world before our eyes by modern wars . 1 8  45 â€¢ the guilty are brought to judgment 365 section 6  the guilty are brought to judgment 45 and set forth to them the likeness of the life of this world as water which we send down from the cloud  so the vegetation of the earth becomes luxuriant by it  then it becomes dry  broken into pieces which the winds scatter . and allah is the holder of power over all things . 46 wealth and children are an adornment of the life of this world  but the everabiding  the good works  are better with jour lord in reward and better in hope . 47 and the day when we cause the mountains to pass away  and you see the earth a levelled plain and we gather them together and leave none of them behind .  48 and they are brought before your lord in ranks . now certainly you have come to us as we created you at first . but you thought that we had not made an appointment for you . 49 and the book is placed  and you see the guilty fearing for what is in it  and they say  o woe to us  what a book is this  it leaves out neither a small thing nor a great one  but numbers them  all   and they find what they did confronting them . and your lord does not wrong anyone . section 7  their helplessness 50 and when we said to the angels  be submissive to adam  they submitted  but not iblls . he was from among the jinn  so he transgressed the commandment of his lord . c will you then take him and his offspring for friends rather than me  and they are your enemies  evil is the exchange for the unjust . 51 i did not make them witness the creation of the heavens and the earth  nor their own creation . nor could i take those who mislead for aiders . a  47  making the earth a levelled plain indicates the removal of all those mighty obstacles which stood in the way of the advancement of truth  and these are the mountains which are made to pass away  see 20105107. b  49  this comprehensive book is the same as is spoken of in 171314 . there is not the slightest action  good or bad  which does not leave its effect behind . c  50  iblls is one of the jinn or the evil spirits  so it is an error to take him for an angel or a good spirit . the spirit of evil is always rebellious  and it is against this that man is warned  so that he should resist every evil tendency . 366 18 . the cave 1852 52 and one day he will say  call on those whom you considered to be my partners . so they will call on them  but they will not answer them  and we shall cause a separation between them . 53 and the guilty will see the fire  and know that they are about to fall into it  and they will find no escape from it . section 8  warning is disregarded 54 and certainly we have made distinct in this quran for mankind every kind of description  and man is in most things con tentious . 55 and nothing prevents people from believing when the guidance comes to them  and from asking forgiveness of their lord  but that  they wait  for the way of the ancients to catch up with them  or that the punishment should confront them . 56 and we do not send messengers but as givers of good news and warning  and those who disbelieve contend by means of falsehood to weaken thereby the truth  and they take my messages and the warning for a mockery . 57 and who is more unjust than he who is reminded of the messages of his lord  then he turns away from them and forgets what his hands have already done  surely we have placed veils over their hearts  so they do not understand it  and a deafness in their ears . a and if you call them to the guidance  they will even then never follow the right course . 58 and jour lord is forgiving  full of mercy . if he were to punish them for what they earn  he would certainly hasten the punishment for them . but for them there is an appointed time from which they will find no refuge . 59 and these towns â€ ” we destroyed them when they did wrong . and we have appointed a time for their destruction . a  57  it is when man becomes so iniquitous as to turn away from the truth and so callous as not to care for the evil that he does that a veil is placed over his heart . b  59  the personal pronoun their refers to the opponents of truth  earlier as well as later . 18  60 moses travels in search of knowledge 367 section 9  moses travels in search of knowledge 60 and when moses said to his servant   i will not cease until i reach the junction of the two rivers  or i will go on for years . 61 so when they reached the junction of the two  rivers   they forgot their fish  and it took its way into the river  being free . 62 but when they had gone further  he said to his servant  bring us our morning meal  we have certainly found this journey of ours tiring . 63 he  the servant  said  did you see when we took refuge on the rock  i forgot the fish  and none but the devil made me forget to speak of it  and it took its way into the river  what a wonder  c 64 he said  this is what we sought for . so they returned retracing their foot steps . a  601  some reports give his name as joshua  the son of nun  the man who afterwards appears so prominently in the history of israel . the incidents narrated in verses 6082 may be the actual experience of moses or this journey may simply be an ascension of moses  like the ascension  mi raj  of the holy prophet  referred to in the last chapter . what is stated in the next section makes the latter view more probable . b  602  moses lived in egypt for forty years  and the junction of the two rivers  majma  albahrain  is no other than the junction of the two great branches of the nile at khartoum . rabbinical and hellenistic literature agree that moses went to ethiopia . hence a journey to khartoum  which was near the southern boundary of ethiopia  made in search of knowledge  is most probable . some commentators  however  do not take these words literally  taking the meaning to be the union of the rivers of human and divine knowledge . i would  however  suggest that if we accept this journey in the light of an ascension  it would be an indication of the limitation of the mosaic dispensation . moses  going on for years until he reached the  the junction of the two rivers  would mean that the mosaic dispensation would see its termination after a time  being replaced by one which was to be guided by a prophet who is the union of the two seas of human and divine knowledge  or one in whom the temporal and the spiritual would find their highest manifestation  this being the holy prophet muhammad . c  63  the loss of the fish was  according to a report  to serve as a sign that the goal had been attained  bukhari  344  . there is nothing either in the quran or in the hadith to show that this was a roasted fish . taking refuge on the rock shows that they were staying at a place which was flooded by the river  and moses  companion  when hastening for refuge  forgot to take the fish along with him . the wonder is not expressed at the fish having gone down into the river  but because he had forgotten to mention the loss to moses . 368 18 . the cave 1865 65 then they found one of our servants whom we had granted mercy from us and whom we had taught knowledge from our selves .  66 moses said to him  may i follow you that you may teach me some of the good you have been taught  67 he said  fou will not be able to have patience with me . 68 and how can you have patience in matters in which you do not have a compre hensive knowledge  69 he said  if allah please  you will find me patient  nor shall i disobey you in anything . 70 he said  if you would follow me  do not question me about anything until i myself speak to you about it . section 10  moses travels in search of knowledge 71 so they set out  until  when they embarked in a boat  he made a hole in it .  moses  said  have you made a hole in it to drown its occupants  fou have surely done a terrible thing . 72 he said  did i not say that you will not be able to have patience with me  73 he said  do not blame me for what i forgot  and do not be hard upon me for what i did . 74 so they went on  until  when they met a boy  he killed him .  moses  said  have you killed an innocent person  not guilty of  killing another  fou have indeed done a horrible thing .  75 he said  did i not say to you that you will not be able to have patience with me  76 he said  if i ask you about anything after this  do not keep company with me . fou will then indeed have found an excuse in my case . 77 so they went on  until  when they came to the people of a town  they asked its people for food  but they refused to entertain them as guests . then they found in it a wall which was on the point of falling  so he put it into a right state .  moses  said  if you had wished  you could have taken a recompense for it . 78 he said  this is the parting between me and you . now i will inform you of the significance of that about which you could not have patience . 79 as for the boat  it belonged to poor people working on the a  65  his name was khadir  bukhari  344  . ss 18  80  moses travels in search of knowledge 369 river  and i intended to damage it  for there was behind them a king who seized every boat by force . 80 and as for the boy  his parents were believers and we feared that he might involve them in wrongdoing and disbelief .  81 so we intended that their lord might give them in his place one better in purity and nearer to mercy . 82 and as for the wall  it belonged to two orphan boys in the city  and there was beneath it a treasure belonging to them  and their father had been a righteous man . so your lord intended that they should attain their maturity and take out their treasure â€ ” a mercy from your lord â€ ” and i did not do it of my own accord . this is the significance of that about which you could not have patience . 6 a  80  that the youth himself deserved death is abundantly clear . his inordi nacy had now reached an extreme when it was feared that his innocent parents would be involved in the trouble which must befall him as a result of his wrong doing . the circumstances were known to khadir  though not to moses . b  82  the interpretation of the three incidents shows a manifestation of divine wisdom in what takes place in the everyday life of man . divine laws  as manifested in nature  are really working towards ultimate good  though sometimes they may appear to the outward eye to be working to the detriment of somebody . the beneficent hand of allah that works in nature is always directing humanity to the goal of great good  though that goal must necessarily be reached with apparent loss . sometimes the loss is only apparent  as in the case of making a hole in the boat  there was no real loss  but the apparent loss served a great purpose and brought much benefit to the owner . the second instance is that in which there is real loss to a person  but it is for the good of humanity at large  for life must be sacrificed for the ultimate good of humanity . the third instance shows that  for the good of humanity  deeds must be done which bring no immediate reward  and that good done by one generation is not devoid of benefit to the next . moses himself had  in fact  to undergo the experience of his teacher  and the incidents seem no more than prophetic allegories of moses  own lifework . moses had to lead his people to a place where they thought they had only been brought to be drowned  but their safe passage through the sea showed that it was for their good . then he had to order his men to fight against an iniquitous people and to put them to death  but he was not shedding human blood to no purpose  for it was really a step towards the evolution of a better race . and finally  his devoting his own life to the israelites  descendants of a righteous man  corresponded to his teacher s building the wall for the orphans without claiming recompense . read in this light  the narration is clearly an ascension of moses  foreshadowing the great events which were to befall him . 370 18 . the cave 1883 section 1 1  dhu1qarnain and gog and magog 83 and they ask you about dhu1qarnain .  say  i will recite to you an account of him . 84 truly we established him  with power  in the land and granted him means of access to everything  8s so he followed a course . 86 until  when he reached the setting place of the sun  he found it going down into a black sea  e and found by it a people . we said  o dhu1qarnain  either punish them or do them a benefit . 87 he said  as for him who is unjust  we shall punish him  then he will be returned to his lord  and he will punish him with an exemplary punishment . 88 and as for him who a  83  dhu1qarnain literally means the twohorned one  or one belonging to two generations or two centuries . the reference here seems to be to the two horned ram of daniel s vision  daniel  83   which he interpreted as the kingdoms of media and persia  which were combined into a single kingdom under one ruler  cyrus  who is erroneously called darius in the bible  encyclopedia biblica and jewish encyclopedia  art . darius   . the reference in daniel s vision is  however  not to cyrus but to darius i hystaspes  521485 b.c .    who allowed the jews to rebuild their temple ... his liberality towards the jews is in complete accord with what we know otherwise of his general policy in religious matters towards the subject nations   enc . biblica  darius   . the reference in the quran in the history of dhu1qarnain is to darius i   darius was the organizer of the persian empire . his conquests served to round off the boundaries of his realm in armenia  the caucasus  and india  and along the turanian steppes and the highlands of central asia   jewish enc  darius i   . the following remarks in the encyclopaedia britannica strengthen this view   darius in his inscriptions appears as a fervent believer in the true religion of zoroaster . but he was also a great statesman and organizer . the time of conquests had come to an end  the wars which darius undertook  like those of augustus  only served the purpose of gaining strong natural frontiers for the empire and keeping down the barbarous tribes on its borders . thus darius subjugated the wild nations of the pontic and armenian mountains  and extended the persian domi nion to the caucasus  for the same reason he fought against the sacae and other turanian tribes  . the references to darius being a fervent believer in the true religion of zoroaster  to his subduing the barbarous tribes on the borders  to his gaining strong natural frontiers for the empire  and to his fighting against the sacae clearly point him out as the dhu1qamain of the quran . b  861  this signifies the westernmost point of his empire . c  862  the place referred to is no other than the black sea  as  armenia being within the kingdom of persia  the black sea formed the northwestern boun dary of the empire . 1 8  89 â€¢ dhulqarnain and gog and magog 371 believes and does good  for him is a good reward  and we shall speak to him an easy word of our command .  89 then he followed a course . 90 until  when he reached  the land of  the rising sun  he found it rising on a people to whom we had given no shelter from it â€ ” 91 so it was . and we had full knowledge of what he had . 92 then he followed a course . 93 until  when he reached  a place  between the two mountains  he found on that side of them a people who could hardly understand a word .  94 they said  dhu1 qarnain  gog and magog do mischief in the land . may we then pay you tribute on condition that you raise a barrier between us and them  95 he said  the power with which my lord has a  88  being a true follower of zoroaster  the wellknown persian prophet  darius seems to have invited these tribes to his religion . b  90  darius goes first westward to the black sea  v. 8586  . then he undertakes an eastward journey â€ ” the land of the rising sun . the description of the people found here  a people who had no shelter from the sun  is a description of the barbarous aboriginal tribes on the shores of the caspian . c  93  the three journeys alluded to seem to have been undertaken with the object of strengthening the frontiers of the empire  the most important of these being that spoken of here  the part of the frontier between the caspian and the black seas  where the caucasus afforded a natural protection against the attacks of the scythians . the two mountains are the mountains of armenia and azarbai jan . the people settling there spoke a different language and could not understand the iranian language . rf  94  in the bible  ezekiel 382 contains the words   son of man  set your face against gog  of the land of magog  the prince of rosh  meshech  and tubal  and prophesy against him  . north of the caucasus we find two rivers bearing the names of tobol and moskva  on the latter of which is situated the ancient city of moscow  and on the former the more recent town of tobolsk . it seems almost certain that these two rivers received their names from the two tribes of ezekiel 382  the tubal and meshech  and then gave their names to the two above mentioned cities . this view is in accordance with the opinion of ancient writers like josephus  who settle the magog north of the caucasus . thus the name magog stands for tribes which occupied territories to the north and northeast of the black sea  tribes which gave their names directly or indirectly to the towns of tobolsk and moscow . another point worth considering is the presence of the gigantic effigies of gog and magog in guildhall  london  which can be traced to a very early period 372 18 . the cave 1896 established me is better  so if only you help me with strength  of men   i will make a fortified barrier between you and them   bring me blocks of iron .  at length  when he had filled up the space between the two mountain sides  he said  blow . till  when he had made it  as  fire  he said  bring me molten brass to pour over it . 97 so they were not able to scale it  nor could they make a hole in it . 98 he said  this is a mercy from my lord  but when the promise of my lord comes to pass he will crumble it  and the promise of my lord is ever true .   and on that day we shall let in english history . this makes it probable that the angles or the saxons had in very ancient times some connection with the scythians or other tribes living north of the caucasus or the black sea . it may be deduced from this that the ancestors of the present teutonic and slav races  the main nations of eastern and western europe respectively  are the gog and magog spoken of in the quran  both these races originating from the same land . the next statement  that the tribes found by darius between azerbaijan and the armenian mountains were constantly harassed by their northern neighbours  the scythians  is also borne out by history .  about 512 darius undertook a war against the scythians . . . the purpose of this war can only have been to attack the nomadic turanian tribes in the rear  and thus to secure peace on the northern fron tier of the empire   encyclopaedia britannica  art . darius   . the barrier referred to in this and the following verses is the famous wall at derbent  on the western shore of the caspian  which had iron gates and numerous watchtowers for defence . its name  alexander s wall  is a misnomer due to the mistake made by muslim historians in supposing dhu1qamain to be alexander . a  96  the blocks of iron were needed for the iron gates in the wall . b  98  from the historical narration of the past  the subject is now changed to the future . gog and magog are described as two nations  and after describing the history of these nations  whose depredations on peaceful nations were brought to an end by darius  we are now told that gog and magog will again be let loose in the latter days . in fact  this is clearly foretold in another chapter of the same period   when gog and magog are let loose and they sally forth from every ele vated place   2196  . the crumbling of the wall which withheld gog and magog for a time is thus explained by the quran itself as the letting loose of gog and magog . just as the building of the wall indicated the confinement of gog and magog to their own territorial bounds  the crumbling of the wall means that they will at some future time be let loose and will then dominate the whole world . this domination is spoken of in the hadith in various ways . according to one hadith   no one will have the power to fight against them   sahih muslim  5220  . 1 8  100 â€¢ dhulqarnain and gog and magog 373 some of them surge against others and the trumpet will be blown  then we shall gather them all together   100 and we shall bring forth hell  exposed to view  on that day before the disbelievers  6 101 whose eyes were under a cover from my reminder  and they could not bear to hear . e according to another   they will drink the water of the whole world   kanaz al ummal  vol . 7  p. 2157  . as shown earlier  the ancestors of gog and magog are the slav and teutonic races  and in the worlddomination of gog and magog is thus clearly hinted the domination of the european nations over the whole world  and the prophecy has thus found fulfilment in our days . a  99  a mighty conflict of nations is clearly spoken of here  and the words no doubt refer to some catastrophe like that which is predicted in the gospels in the words   for nation will rise against nation  and kingdom against kingdom . and there will be famines  pestilences  and earthquakes in various places . all these are the beginning of sorrows   matthew  2478  . the quran makes it clear that the reference in nation rising against nation is to the great european conflicts of modern times . gog and magog  or the european nations  having subdued the whole world  could not agree on the division of the spoils  and they are rushing at one another s throats  and the whole world being subject to them  their struggle has assumed the form of a world conflict . but if the first part of the verse speaks of the destruction due to these wars  the second part raises a great hope . a mighty revolution will come about . that is what is meant by the blowing of the trumpet . the revolution would unite them  it would drive them to one common faith . material benefits having turned man into the enemy of man  a spiritual awakening will  we are told  be brought about which will change the world entirely . instead of cutting one another s throats people will learn to love one another  and they will all be but one nation . there is a broad enough hint here at the nation of islam  for there is but one faith  the faith of islam  which has been able to weld diverse people into one whole . the day of peace for this world will dawn with the dawning of the idea on the mind of man that there is only a single nation  the human nation  that lives on this earth   mankind is a single nation   2213  . b  100  these words complete the picture of the great conflict spoken of in the previous verse . it describes the severity of the conflict  which will reduce the world to a veritable hell . there was hell raging on this earth in world war 2 . what a world war 3 may bring  no one can say . c  101  the reason is given in these words why these disasters will be brought on man  these are people whose eyes are under a cover from my remin der . in fact  they are so estranged from god that they can not even bear to hear his reminder . so thoroughly have lust and greed engrossed the civilized world  374 18 . the cave 18102 section 12  christian nations 102 do those who disbelieve think that they can take my servants to be protectors besides me  a surely we have prepared hell as an entertainment for the disbelievers . 103 say  shall we inform you who are the greatest losers in respect of deeds  104 those whose effort is lost in this world s life  and they think that they are making good manufactures . 105 those are they who disbelieve in the messages of their lord and meeting with him  so their deeds are fruitless . nor shall we set up a balance for them on the day of resurrection . c 106 that is their reward â€ ” hell  because they disbelieved and held my messages and my messengers in mockery . 107 as for those who believe and do good deeds  for them are gardens of paradise  an entertainment  108 to abide therein  they will not desire removal from there . 109 say  if the sea were ink for the words of my lord  the sea would surely be exhausted before the words of my lord were exhausted  even if we brought as much again to add  to it  . 110 say  i am only a mortal like you â€ ” a  102  the christians are meant here  because theirs is the most prominent example of having taken a servant of allah  a prophet  for god . in fact  jesus christ is the only person whom the quran recognizes as a righteous servant of god and who has been taken for god by a large part of the world . b  104  this is a clear description of the present attitude of the civilized nations to their moral and spiritual needs â€ ” their effort is entirely wasted in this world s life  and they can not give a moment s consideration to the life after death . the portrait of the material civilization  to which christianity has led  as drawn in this section  attains to its most vivid clearness in these words . manufacture is the one speciality and pride of the west . but they are so engrossed in the contest of manufactures that they have no thought of god left in their minds . c  105  their deeds are fruitless because what they do relates to the vanities of life . they have no vision for the higher values of life  for the ultimate end  which is here spoken of as the meeting with the lord . hence we are told that no balance will be set up for them on the day of resurrection  because all their deeds relate to this life  and end where this life ends . d  109  in these words there is a refutation of the christian doctrine that  the word was with god   or that  the word was god   john 11  . the words of god are so numerous  we are here told  that the sea would be exhausted  if it were to 18110 christian nations 375 it is revealed to me that your god is one god . so whoever hopes to meet his lord  he should do good deeds  and make no one a partner  with god  in the service of his lord . serve as ink for writing them . in fact  everything created is a word of god accord ing to the quran  and things created know no end . chapter 19 maryam mary the name of this chapter is taken from the story of mary  mother of jesus . it begins with an account of the birth of john and of jesus  the last representa tives of prophecy in the house of israel  and then refutes the doctrine of the divine sonship of jesus . it then mentions the missions of some earlier pro phets  showing that only human beings are raised to reform the world . at the end the doctrine that jesus is the son of god is again denounced . this chapter was revealed in the early period at makkah  about or before the fifth year of the holy prophet s mission . section 1  zacharias and john in the name of allah  the beneficent  the merciful . 1 sufficient  guide  blessed  knowing  truthful god .  2 a mention of the mercy of your lord to his servant zacharias â€ ” 3 when he called upon his lord  crying in secret . 4 he said  my lord  my bones are weakened  and my head flares with whiteness  of hair   and i have never been unsuccessful in my prayer to you  my lord . 5 and i fear my kinsfolk after me  and my wife is barren  so grant me from yourself an heir svho should inherit me and inherit from the children of jacob  and make him  my lord  acceptable  to you  . 7 o zacharias  we give you good news of a boy  whose name is john  we have not made before anyone his equal . c 8 he said  a  1  the original arabic consists of the letters kaf  ha  ya  ain and sad . these stand for the words kafin  sufficient   hadin  guide   yamtn  blessed   alim  knowing   and sadiq  truthful  . b  6  his fear was due to their not leading righteous lives  and he feared there would be none to lead people into the ways of righteousness after him . the inheri tance of the children of jacob is the inheritance of the divine blessing of prophet hood  which had been promised to jacob s children . c  7  it is not  of course  meant that one like john or equal to him was never 376 199 mary and jesus 377 my lord  how shall i have a son  and my wife is barren  and i have reached extreme old age  9 he said  so  it will be  . four lord says  it is easy to me  and indeed i created you before  when you were nothing . 10 he said  my lord  give me a sign . he said  four sign is that you do not speak to people three nights  being in sound health .  n so he went forth to his people from the sanctuary and proclaimed to them  glorify  allah  morning and evening . 12 o john  take hold of the book with strength . and we gran ted him wisdom when a child  13 and kindheartedness from us and purity . and he was dutiful  14 and kindly to his parents  and he was not insolent  disobedient .  15 and peace on him the day he was born and the day he died  and the day he is raised to life  section 2  mary and jesus 16 and mention mary in the book . when she drew aside from her family to an eastern place  17 so she screened herself from them . then we sent to her our spirit and it appeared to her as a well made man . c 18 she said  i seek refuge from you in the beneficent  before created in the world . according to the gospels   among those born of women there has not risen one greater than john the baptist   matthew  1111  . the meaning is that one like him was not born in zacharias  family  because in the previous verse it is his own relatives about whom zacharias says that he feared  and therefore an assurance was now given to him that the promised son would not be like the other members of his family regarding whom he feared . or the meaning may be that one like him had not appeared in that age . a  10  in 341 the words are three days  thus showing that three days and three nights are meant . the quran does not support the idea that zacharias was struck dumb  because it speaks of him as being in sound health . the object of assuming silence was to be engaged solely in prayer to the divine being  and hence zacharias told his people also to glorify god . b  14  the various aspects of the character of john deserve to be noted . he was pure and sinless and never disobeyed god . in fact  what is said of one pro phet is equally true of all . they are all pure from birth  and never disobey god . c  17  it was in a vision that the spirit came  and the conversation that follows also took place in a vision . the word tamaththala   it appeared   lends support to this  for it signifies assuming the likeness of another thing  and this happens only in a vision . further  the spirit or angel of god appears to his chosen ones only in a vision . 378 19 . maryam â€¢ 19  19 if you are one guarding against evil . 19 he said  i am only bearer of a message of your lord  that i will give you a pure boy . a 20 she said  how can i have a son and man has not yet touched me  nor have i been unchaste  21 he said  so  it will be  . four lord says  it is easy to me  and that we may make him a sign to people and a mercy from us . and it is a matter decreed . 6 22 then she conceived him  and withdrew with him to a remote place . 23 and the pains of childbirth drove her to the trunk of a palmtree . she said  oh  i wish i had died before this  and had been a thing quite forgotten  6 24 so a voice came to her from beneath her  do not grieve  surely your lord has provided a stream beneath you . 25 and shake towards you the trunk of the palmtree  it will drop on you fresh ripe dates . 26 so eat and drink a  19  the words  will give you a pure boy are the words of the message . the spirit only conveyed the divine message . every word of the quran is the word of god  but every word was delivered to the holy prophet by the angel . b  211  jesus was a sign to people  in the sense that he was made a prophet  and every prophet is a sign  because the divine revelation granted to him affords a clear proof of the existence of the divine being . or  he was a sign to the israelites in particular  because with him prophethood came to an end among the israelites . c  212  she conceived him in the ordinary way in which women conceive children . d  231  this shows that mary gave birth to jesus while on a journey  hence the reference to water and food in v. 24 and 25  such as one can only find in a journey . that she was going to a distant place is shown by v. 22 . she may have had recourse to the trunk of a palmtree to find a support in the throes of child birth . e  232  mary gave birth to jesus under the ordinary circumstances which women experience in giving birth to children . the throes of childbirth were too severe for her to bear  and hence she gave utterance to such words . the reference to the pains of childbirth clearly shows that an ordinary human child was coming into the world . or  there may be a reference to genesis 316  in pain you shall bring forth children .   25  the quran does not accept that jesus was born on 25th december . it was the time when fresh ripe dates are found on palmtrees . it is now a recognized fact that 25th december was not jesus  birthday . according to the birth account in luke 28  shepherds were keeping watch over their flocks by night in the fields  which shows that it was not winter . the 25th of december was taken from the birthday of the persian sungod mithra . 19  27 â€¢ mary and jesus 379 and be comforted . then if you see any mortal  say  surely i have vowed a fast to the beneficent  so i will not speak to anyone today .  27 then she came to her people with him  carrying him . they said  mary  you have indeed brought a strange thing  e 28 sister of aaron   jour father was not a wicked man  nor was your mother an unchaste woman  29 but she pointed to him . they said  how should we speak to one who is a child in the cradle  e 30 he said  i am indeed a servant of allah . he has given me the a  26  it was really a kind of fast . zacharias  as we have already seen  was told not to speak to people for three days . b  271  the conversation in v. 2733 is alone sufficient to make it clear that this incident relates to a time when jesus had grown up sufficiently to have been appointed a prophet and to have received divine revelation . the quran does not relate stories in all their details  and often omits a number of incidents which are not needed for its purpose . for instance  v. 1 1 relates only zacharias  receiving the joyful news of a son  while v. 12 asks that son to take hold of the book with strength . jesus could only say that he was made a prophet when he was actually entrusted with the mission of a prophet  and not before . moreover  it is unreason able to suppose that  as soon as mary gave birth to the child  she took it to her people to make a show of it . the word carrying does not show that she was carry ing him in her arms  it means that he was being carried on an animal . compare 992  where some of the companions are spoken of as coming to the prophet that he might carry them  and he is related as replying that he did not have that on which to carry them  i.e . animals . compare matthew 2117 where the story is related of jesus entering jerusalem riding an ass  or an ass and a colt . c  272  the reference in mary s bringing a strange thing may be to her having given birth to a son who claimed greater authority than the elders of israel  with a deeper hint to the calumny against her  for which see 4156 . in his reply jesus does not make a single reference to the circumstances of his birth . hence the inference is quite reasonable that the question was directed against the mission of jesus and not against the circumstances of his birth . d  28  the fact that mary was devoted to the temple from the age of three to twelve years shows that she belonged to the priestly class  being of the levitical race . hence she is called sister of aaron . the word ukht  meaning sister  is by no means limited to the close bloodrelationship . e  29  old and learned jews would no doubt speak of a young man who was born and brought up before their eyes as a child in the cradle  as if disdaining to address one so young . 380 19 . maryam â€¢ 19  31 book and made me a prophet  31 and he has made me blessed wherever i may be  and he has enjoined on me prayer and the due charity so long as i live   32 and to be kind to my mother  and he has not made me insolent  unblessed . 33 and peace on me the day i was born  and the day i die  and the day i am raised to life . 34 such is jesus son of mary â€ ” a statement of truth about which they dispute . 35 it does not befit allah that he should take to himself a son . glory be to him  when he decrees a matter he only says to it  be  and it is . 36 and surely allah is my lord and your lord  so serve him . this is the right path . c 37 but factions from among them differed  so woe to those who disbelieve  because of their presence on a grievous day  38 how clearly will they hear and see on the day when they come to us  but the wrong doers are today in manifest error . 39 and warn them of the day of regret  when the matter is decided . and they are  now  in negli gence and they do not believe . 40 surely we inherit the earth and those on it  and to us they are returned . a  31  it is clear that this conversation did not take place when jesus was an infant in the cradle  but when he had actually been made a prophet . it is absurd to suppose that prayers and charity were enjoined on jesus while he was only a day old and that he really observed these injunctions at that age . jesus  answer clearly shows that he was addressing his people after he had been entrusted with the mission of prophethood . b  32  here only the mother is spoken of  whereas in a similar case in v. 14 john is spoken of as being kind to both parents . this may be due to the fact that joseph may not have been living at the time when jesus spoke these words . joseph was already an old man when he married mary  and by the time that the ministry of jesus begins we find no mention of him even in the gospels  the mother and brothers being the only relations mentioned . or  the mother alone is mentioned because the gospels relate an incident showing that jesus was rude to his mother  matthew  1248   and this verse disproves the statement  it being one of the objects of the quran to clear jesus of all false charges . c  36  according to matthew  when jesus was tempted of the devil  who asked him to worship him  jesus  reply was   for it is written  you shall worship the lord your god  and him only you shall serve   matthew  4  10  . d  39  the day of judgment is here called the day of regret  because man will then regret that he wasted the opportunity given to him to work for his own good . 19  41 â€¢ abraham 381 section 3  abraham 41 and mention abraham in the book . surely he was a truthful man  a prophet . 42 when he said to his sire  my sire  why do you worship something which does not hear  nor see  nor can it avail you at all  43 my sire  to me indeed has come the knowledge which has not come to you  so follow me  i will guide you on a right path . 44 my sire  do not serve the devil . surely the devil is disobedient to the beneficent . 45 my sire  surely i fear that a punishment from the beneficent may afflict you  so that you become a friend of the devil . 46 he said  do you dislike my gods  abraham  if you do not stop  i will certainly drive you away . and leave me for a time . 47 he said  peace be on you  i shall pray my lord to forgive you . surely he is ever kind to me . 48 and i withdraw from you and what you call on besides allah  and i call upon my lord . maybe i shall not remain unblessed in calling upon my lord . 49 so when he withdrew from them and what they worshipped besides allah  we gave him isaac and jacob . and each  of them  we made a prophet . 50 and we gave them of our mercy  and we granted them a truthful mention of eminence . 4 section 4  other prophets are raised 51 and mention moses in the book . surely he was one purified  and was a messenger  a prophet 52 and we called to him a  49  it is elsewhere made clear that jacob was his grandson  1171  2172  . nor should it be supposed that giving signifies only the giving of a son  for of moses it is said in v. 53  we gave him his brother aaron  a prophet  though aaron was older than moses . b  50  however humble a life a prophet may lead  he is granted an eminence among later generations  and the record of eminence of a prophet is a truthful one . c  51  rasul  or messenger  means one who is sent with a message for the re generation of people  while nabi  or prophet  is one who has the gift of prophecy  i.e.  who receives a naba  or information from on high . the elect who are chosen for the regeneration of man are called prophets as receiving knowledge from allah  and messengers as delivering to humanity the messages they receive . 382 19 . maryam â€¢ 19  53 from the blessed side of the mountain  and we made him draw near to us in communion . 53 and we gave him out of our mercy his brother aaron  a prophet . 54 and mention ishmael in the book . surely he was truthful in promise  and he was a messenger  a prophet .  55 and he enjoined on his people prayer and charity  and was one in whom his lord was well pleased . 56 and mention idrls in the book . surely he was a truthful man  a prophet  57 and we raised him to an elevated state . 58 these are they on whom allah bestowed favours  from among the prophets  of the offspring of adam  and of those whom we carried with noah  and of the offspring of abraham and israel  and of those whom we guided and chose . when the messages of the beneficent were recited to them  they fell down in submission  weeping . 59 but after them came an evil generation  who wasted prayers and followed lusts  so they will meet with ruin  60 except those who repent and believe and do good â€ ” such will enter the garden  and they will not be wronged in the least   gardens of perpetuity which the beneficent has promised to his servants  in the unseen . surely his promise ever comes to pass . 62 they will hear therein no vain discourse  but only  peace  c and they have their sustenance therein  morning and evening . 63 this is the garden which we cause those of our servants to inherit who keep their duty . a  54  when abraham prayed to the lord  that ishmael might live before you   the reply was   and as for ishmael  i have heard you   genesis  1718  20   which shows that ishmael was made a prophet . see also 2124125  footnotes . b  57  idrls is the same as enoch of the bible . the word raf  which is used of jesus  is also used of enoch  and some commentators therefore misinterpret it as indicating that enoch was taken up to heaven alive . but the same mistake is made in both cases  for raf signifies raising to high dignity  see 355 footnote 2 . the mistake seems to have arisen from what is said of enoch in the bible   and enoch walked with god  and he was not  for god took him   genesis  524  . c  62  this description of the hereafter shows that the muslim in this world talks of nothing but peace . islam is really peace  and it is by making peace here with the creator and his creatures that one can find peace hereafter . this is the great truth underlying the islamic idea of paradise . the state of perfect peace spoken of here is called the garden in v. 63 which the righteous will inherit . 1 9  64 â€¢ how the opponents were dealt with 383 64 and we do not descend but by the command of jour lord . to him belongs what is before us and what is behind us and what is between these  and your lord is never forgetful .  65 lord of the heavens and the earth and all that is between them  so serve him and be patient in his service . do you know anyone equal to him  section 5  how the opponents were dealt with 66 and says man  when i am dead  shall i truly be brought forth alive  67 does not man remember that we created him before  when he was nothing  68 so by your lord  we shall certainly gather them together and the devils  6 then shall we bring them around hell on their knees . 69 then we shall draw forth from every group those most rebellious against the beneficent . 70 again  we certainly know best those who deserve most to be burned in it . 71 and there is not one of you but shall come to it . c this is an unavoidable decree of your lord . 72 and we shall deliver those who guard against evil  and leave the wrongdoers in it on their knees . 73 and when our clear messages are recited to them  those who disbelieve say to those who believe  which of the two groups is better in position and better assembled  6 74 and how many a generation have we a  64  as the angels brought revelation to previous prophets  indicated in the words we do not descend   so they now bring revelation  by the command of the lord  to the holy prophet muhammad . the words  your lord is never forgetful  signify that the promises and prophecies made by god through his prophets could not be forgotten . thus  after an account of the previous prophets  the subject moves to the revelation of the holy prophet for the remainder of the chapter . b  68  the devils here are clearly those humans who lead others to evil . c  71  the wicked only are spoken of  as the context shows clearly . that the righteous will not go to hell is made clear further on   the day when we gather the dutiful to the beneficent to receive honours  and drive the guilty to hell  as thirsty beasts   v. 8586  . according to 21102  the righteous will not hear the faintest sound of hell . d  72  the word thumma  the first word of this verse  frequently means and  besides its meaning of then . it is wrong to suppose that the righteous will be first cast into hell and then delivered . e  73  that is  they are proud of their great wealth and numerous forces . 384 19 . maryam â€¢ 19  75 destroyed before them  who had better possessions and appearance  75 say  as for him who is in error  the beneficent will prolong his length of days  until they see what they were threatened with  either the punishment or the hour .  then they will know who is worse in position and weaker in forces .  76 and allah increases in guidance those who go aright . and the everabiding  the good works  are better with your lord in reward and yield better return . 77 have you seen him who disbelieves in our messages and says  i shall certainly be given wealth and children  c 78 has he gained knowledge of the unseen  or received a promise from the beneficent  79 by no means  we write down what he says  and we shall lengthen to him the length of the punishment  80 and we shall inherit from him what he says  and he will come to us alone . d 81 and they have taken gods besides allah  that they should be to them a source of strength â€ ” 82 by no means  they will soon deny their worshipping them  and be their adversaries . section 6  false doctrine of sonship 83 do you not see that we send the devils against the disbelie vers  inciting them provokingly  84 so make no haste against them . we only number out to them a number  of days  . 85 the day when we gather the dutiful to the beneficent to receive honours  86 and drive the guilty to hell  as thirsty beasts . 87 they have no power of intercession  except him who has made a covenant with the beneficent . a  751  the hour signifies the hour of doom  when their power will be utterly destroyed . in comparison with this is the lighter  punishment  . b  752  in these words it is clearly indicated that the time will come when they will find themselves in an evil condition  and their forces weaker than the forces of truth . c  77  they have no eye for the higher values of life  all they want is wealth and children or followers . rf  80  the reference is to his saying in v. 77   i shall certainly be given wealth and children  . god s inheriting thus means that their wealth and children will be taken away from them and ultimately be a source of strength to islam . 19  88 â€¢ false doctrine of sonship 385 88 and they say  the beneficent has taken to himself a son .  certainly you make a detestable assertion  90 the heavens may almost be torn apart at it  and the earth split  and the mountains crumble down in pieces  91 that they ascribe a son to the beneficent  92 and it is not worthy of the beneficent that he should take to him self a son .  93 there is none in the heavens and the earth but comes to the beneficent as a servant . 94 certainly he comprehends them  and has numbered them all . 95 and everyone of them will come to him on the day of resurrection  alone . 96 those who believe and do good deeds  for them the bene ficent will surely bring about love .  97 so we have made it easy in jour tongue  only that you should give good news by it to those who guard against evil  and should warn by it a contentious people . 98 and how many a generation before them have we destroyed  can you see anyone of them or hear a sound of them  a  92  verses 8993 contain a most emphatic and clear condemnation of the christian doctrine of the godhead of jesus christ . as this chapter belongs to about the fifth year of the holy prophet s mission  it shows that islam had set before itself from the very first the grand object of the reformation of christianity . the particular point on which stress is laid in this chapter  as against the fundamental errors of the christian religion  sonship and atonement  is that god is rahman  beneficent   and does not require any compensation to forgive sinners . it is for this reason that the name rahman  in preference to all other names of the divine being  is mentioned over and over again in this chapter  and the key to the whole position is contained in v. 92 in the words   is not worthy of the beneficent that he should take to himself a son . in fact  the doctrine of atonement is contradicted by christ s own words in the lord s prayer   and forgive us our debts as we forgive our debtors   matthew  612  . a man is said to forgive his debtor when he remits the debt and does not exact any compensation . even thus does god forgive sinners  he needs no compensation . b  96  allah s bringing about love for the righteous means that he loves them himself and inspires love for them in the hearts of other people  while they also love allah as well as their fellowbeings . the righteous servants of god are opposed at first  but gradually their goodness prevails and they are loved and admired . there is a prophetic reference here to the great love with which the hearts of the enemies of the prophet were to be inspired in the near future  and even today the hearts of people are being inspired with greater and greater love for him as the world witnesses the good which he did to humanity . chapter 20 ta ha the initial letters of this chapter serve as its title . beginning by declaring that the quran was revealed to be triumphant in the world  it deals at length with the story of moses  showing how he was ultimately successful . it follows this by a description of the opposition to the prophet muhammad and the consequences of that opposition . this chapter was revealed in the early period at makkah  about or before the fifth year of the holy prophet s section 1  moses is called in the name of allah  the beneficent  the merciful . 1 o man   2 we have not revealed the quran to you that you may be unsuccessful  3 but it is a reminder to him who fears  4 a revelation from him who created the earth and the high heavens . e 5 the beneficent is established on the throne of power . 6 to him belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is in the earth and whatever is between them and whatever is beneath the soil . 7 and if you utter the saying aloud  surely he knows the secret  that you hide   and what is yet more hidden .  allah â€ ” there is no god but he . his are the most beautiful names . a  1  ta ha  a combination of the two letters ta and ha  is  according to various early commentators  a word meaning o man . it is also considered to be a name of the holy prophet . b  2  that is  it could not be that the prophet  to whom the quran was revealed  should remain unsuccessful in bringing about the transformation for which it was revealed . it is a consolation  and a clear prophecy  that a mighty transformation will be brought about  not only in arabia but in the whole world  for that was the object which the quran had set out to accomplish from the first . c  4  the quran can not be a failure  because it is a manifestation of the will of him who holds sway over all . d  7  the secret is what a man hides in his heart  and what is yet more hidden is what is in the subconscious mind . both are known alike to allah . 386 20  9 â€¢ moses is called 387 9 and has the story of moses come to .you  10 when he saw a fire  he said to his family  wait  i see a fire  maybe i will bring to you a live coal from it or find guidance at the fire .  11 so when he came to it  a voice came  o moses  12 surely i am your lord  so take off jour shoes  surely you are in the sacred valley tuwa . 13 and i have chosen you so listen to what is revealed  14 surely i am allah  there is no god but i  so serve me  and keep up prayer for my remembrance . 15 surely the hour is coming â€ ” i am about to make it manifest c â€ ” so that every soul may be rewarded as it strives . 16 so do not let him who does not believe in it  and follows his low desire  turn you away from it  so that you perish . 17 and what is this in jour right hand  o moses  18 he said  this is my staff â€ ” i lean on it  and i beat leaves with it for my sheep  and i have other uses for it . 19 he said  throw it down  o moses . 20 so he threw it down  and lo  it was a snake  gliding .   a  10  as the verses that follow show  moses received a divine revelation on this occasion  and his seeing the fire was also a part of the revelation  it was with the spiritual eye that he saw it . the quran has stated elsewhere that revelation is received only in three ways  4251   and in each of these the recipient is really given particular senses with which to feel and see things . b  12  the command to take off the shoes is a metaphorical expression for making the heart vacant from care for family and property . according to some  it is a command to stay  as if to say  make yourself at home  . c  15  ikhfa is one of the words which convey contrary significances  con cealing or removing that which conceals a thing . but that here it does not mean concealing is made clear by the context . it is the coming of the hour and the meting out of rewards and punishments that the verse deals with  which is clearly removing the veil or making the hour manifest . note that the hour does not necessarily signify the resurrection  on the other hand  it very often indicates the doom of a people  the hour of the departure of their glory and power . d  20  all this was experienced by moses in that particular state in which the recipient of a revelation finds himself at the time of the revelation  see 7108 foot note . what was shown to moses on this occasion had a deeper significance  see v. 23  where the object of showing these signs is stated to be that we may show you of our greater signs . thus the two signs mentioned here were really indications of something greater . the word asa  staff  stands metaphorically for a community . hence the sight of his staff becoming a gliding serpent was shown to him as an indication that his community  i.e.  the israelites  who had been reduced to a state of slavery under pharaoh  would soon become a living nation . 388 20 . taha 2021 21 he said  take hold of it and do not fear . we shall return it to its former state . 22 and press your hand to your side  it will come out white without harm â€ ” another sign   23 that we may show you of our greater signs . 24 go to pharaoh  surely he has exceeded the limits . section 2  moses and aaron go to pharaoh 25 he said  my lord  expand my breast for me  with know ledge   26 and ease my task for me  27 and loosen the knot from my tongue   28  that  they may understand my word . 29 and give to me a helper from my family  30 aaron  my brother  31 add to my strength by him  32 and make him share my task â€ ” 33 so that we may glorify you much  34 and much remember you . 35 surely  you are ever seeing us . 36 he said  you are indeed granted your petition  o moses . 37 and indeed we bestowed on you a favour at another time  38 when we revealed to your mother what was revealed  39 put him into a chest  then put it into the river  the river will cast it upon the shore â€ ” there an enemy to me and an enemy to him shall take him up . and i shed on you love from me  and that you may be brought up before my eyes . e 40 when your sister went and said  shall i direct you to one who will take charge of him  so we brought you back to your mother that she might be comforted and she should not grieve . and you killed a man  then we delivered you from grief  and tried you with  many  trials . then you stayed for years among the people of midian . then you came here as a  22  bearing in mind what has been said above  this has also a deeper meaning . a white hand signifies an argument made very clear . the deeper signi ficance in this case was that his arguments would prevail . b  27  by a man who has a knot in his tongue is meant a man unable to speak freely . c  39  moses was born at a time when pharaoh had commanded all male children born to the israelites to be thrown into the nile . moses  mother kept him concealed for three months  and at last  unable to hide him any longer  cast him upon the river in an ark of bulrushes  whence he was picked up by pharaoh s daughter  exodus  2110  . 20  41 â€¢ moses and the enchanters 389 ordained  o moses . 41 and i have chosen you for myself . 42 go you and your brother with my messages and do not be remiss in remembering me . 43 go both of you to pharaoh  surely he is inordinate  44 then speak to him a gentle word  perhaps he may be mindful or fear . 45 they said  our lord  we fear that he may hasten to do us harm or be inordinate . 46 he said  do not fear  surely i am with you â€ ” i do hear and see . 47 so go to him and say  surely we are two messengers of jour lord  a so send forth the children of israel with us  and do not torment them . indeed we have brought you a message from jour lord  and peace be on him who follows the guidance . 48 it has indeed been revealed to us that punishment will overtake him who rejects and turns away .  49  pharaoh  said  who is your lord  moses  50 he said  our lord is he who gives to everything its creation  then guides  it  . e 51 he said  what then is the state of the former generations  52 he said  the knowledge of that is with my lord in a book  my lord neither makes error nor forgets â€ ” 53 who made the earth for you an expanse and made for you paths in it and sent down water from the clouds . then with that we bring forth pairs of various herbs . 54 eat and pasture your cattle . surely there are signs in this for those who have understanding . section 3  moses and the enchanters 55 from it we created you  and into it we shall return you  and from it raise you a second time . 56 and truly we showed him a  47  both moses and aaron were messengers  sing  rasul  of god . b  48  this contains a clear warning to pharaoh of his end in case of rejec tion . moses and aaron were directed to convey this message . the whole account of their actual going to pharaoh and the delivery of this message is omitted here  and the next verse gives us pharaoh s reply to their demand . c  50  this verse contains an argument for the necessity of divine revelation . it says that  as allah has created everything  and then given it the qualities and means by which it can attain to perfection â€ ” for this is the true significance of hadd  i.e.  guides it  to its goal  â€ ” so man also stands in need of spiritual and moral directions for his attainment to perfection . 390 20 . ta ha â€¢ 20  57 all our signs but he rejected and refused . 57 said he  have you come to us to turn us out of our land by your enchantment  moses  58 we too can bring to you enchantment like it  so make an appoint ment between us and you  which we do not break  neither we nor you  in a central place . 59  moses  said  your appointment is the day of the festival  and let the people be gathered in the early forenoon . 60 so pharaoh went back and settled his plan  then came . 61 moses said to them  woe to you  do not fabricate a lie against allah or he will destroy you by punishment  and he fails indeed who fabricates  a lie  . 62 so they disputed among themselves about their affair and kept the talk secret . 63 they said  these are surely two enchanters who would drive you out from your land by their enchantment  and destroy your excellent institutions . 64 so settle your plan  then come  ranged  in ranks  and he will succeed indeed this day who is uppermost . 65 they said  moses  will you throw  or shall we be the first to throw  66 he said  no  you throw down . then lo  their cords and their rods â€ ” it appeared to him by their enchantment as if they ran . a 67 so moses conceived fear in his mind . 68 we said  do not fear  surely you are the uppermost . 69 and throw down what is in your right hand â€ ” it will eat up what they have produced . what they have produced is only the trick of an enchanter  and the enchanter does not succeed wherever he comes from . 70 so the en chanters fell down prostrate  saying  we believe in the lord of aaron and moses . 71  pharaoh  said  you believe in him before i give you permission  surely he is your chief who taught you enchantment . so i shall cut off your hands and your feet on opposite sides and i shall crucify you on the trunks of palmtrees  and you shall certainly know which of us can give the severer and the more a  66  the forces of untruth appear to carry the day for a while  but are soon vanquished  see v. 69 . also compare 71 17  where these cords and rods are des cribed as their lies . b  67  moses feared that people might be misled . 2072  the israelites worship the calf 391 lasting punishment . 72 they said  we can not prefer you to the clear arguments that have come to us and to him who made us  so decide whatever you will decide . fou can only decide about this world s life . 73 surely we believe in our lord that he may forgive us our faults and the magic to which you compelled us . and allah is best and everabiding . 74 whoever comes guilty to his lord  for him is surely hell . he will neither die in it  nor live .  75 and who ever comes to him a believer  having done good deeds  for them are high ranks â€ ” 76 gardens of perpetuity  in which rivers flow  to abide in them . and such is the reward of him who purifies him self . section 4  the israelites worship the calf 77 and certainly we revealed to moses  travel by night with my servants  then strike for them a dry path in the sea  not fearing to be caught  nor being afraid . 78 so pharaoh followed them with his armies  then the sea covered them that would cover them . 79 and pharaoh led his people astray and he did not guide aright . 80 o children of israel  we truly delivered you from your enemy  and made a covenant with you on the blessed side of the mountain  and sent to you the manna and the quails . 81 eat of the good things we have provided for you  and do not exceed the limits in that respect  so that my wrath comes upon you  and he on whom my wrath comes  he perishes indeed . 82 and surely i am forgiving toward him who repents and believes and does good  then walks aright . 83 and what made you hasten from your people  o moses  84 he said  they are here on my track  and i hastened on to you  my lord  that you might be pleased . 85 he said  surely we have tried your people in your absence  and the samirl e has led them astray . a  74  those in hell are not alive  because spiritually they are dead  and they are not dead because death would mean the cessation of their torments . b  77  this shows that there was at that time a dry path in the sea  see 250. c  85  the verse shows that some person other than aaron was responsible for making the calf . from rabbinical literature it appears that the egyptians who had 392 20 . ta ha â€¢ 20  86 86 so moses returned to his people angry  sorrowing . he said  my people  did not your lord promise you a goodly promise  did the promised time  then  seem long to you  or did you wish that dis pleasure from your lord should come upon you  so that you broke  your  promise to me  87 they said  we did not break the promise to you of our own accord  but we were made to bear the burdens of the ornaments of the people  then we cast them away  and thus did the samirl suggest .  88 then he brought forth for them a calf  a  lifeless  body  having a lowing sound   so they said  this is your god and the god of moses  but he forgot . 89 could they not see that it returned no reply to them  e nor controlled any harm or benefit for them  section 5  the end of calfworship 90 and aaron indeed had said to them before  my people  you are only tried by it  and surely your lord is the beneficent god  so follow me and obey my order . 91 they said  we shall not cease to keep to its worship until moses returns to us . 92  moses  said  aaron  what prevented you  when you saw them going astray  93 that you did not follow me  have you  then  disobeyed my order  94 he said  son of my mother  do not seize me by my beard  nor by come with the israelites were foremost in demanding the making of the calf . a  87  the israelites may have borrowed ornaments from the egyptians as stated in exodus 1235  and the reference may here be to those ornaments  or the significance may simply be that the nomadic tribes of israel  who were unaccustomed to these things  had imbibed these habits from the egyptians  and now gave up those ornaments at the suggestion of the samirl . the reply of the people states clearly they had not done the thing of their own accord  and hence the reference in the concluding words is to the suggestions cast into the minds of the people by the samirl . b  88  it had neither a voice nor a soul  but it was only a sound produced by the air passing through the hollow metal of which it was made . c  89  the argument in this verse shows that god not only listens to prayers but also gives a reply to his true worshippers when they pray to him . d  90  from this it is clear that not only had aaron no part in making the calf  but he even enjoined his people to give up its worship . the quran here con tradicts the bible . 20  95 â€¢ the end of calfworship 393 my head . surely i was afraid you would say  fou have caused division among the children of israel and not waited for my word . 95  moses  said  what was jour object  samirt  96 he said  i per ceived what they did not perceive  so i took a handful from the footprints of the messenger then i threw it away . thus did my soul entice me .  97 he said  go away then  it is  the punishment  for you in this life to say  do not touch  me  . and surely for you is a pro mise which shall not fail . and look at your god to whose worship you have kept . we will certainly burn it  then we will scatter it in the sea . 4 98 your lord is only allah  there is no god but he . he comprehends all things in  his  knowledge . 99 thus we relate to you some news of what has happened before . and indeed we have given you a reminder from our selves . 100 whoever turns away from it  he will surely bear a burden on the day of resurrection  101 abiding in this  state  . and evil will be their burden on the day of resurrection â€ ” 102 the day when the trumpet is blown  and we shall gather the guilty  blind  c on that day  103 consulting together secretly  you stayed only ten  days   104 we know best what they say when the fairest a  96  the stories which many commentators have related under this verse are all baseless . the messenger is evidently moses himself  and his footprints  athar  signify his sunnah  i.e.  his practices and sayings  a significance to which all authorities agree  the word being well known in muslim religious literature . the taking a handful means a small part of it . the man who made the calf thus asserts that he had a clearer perception of things than the israelites  that he accepted the teachings of moses only partially  and confesses that he now threw off even that part and made a calf for worship . b  97  this shows that the ashes of the calf were thrown into the sea  and the story of the israelites being made to drink of water mixed with the ashes of the calf is not  therefore  credited by the quran  which here again contradicts the bible . the punishment given to the samiri is that of an outcast in society  who is prohi bited from having any relations with the israelite people . c  102  the word zurq means blueeyed  but may signify blind  in reference to the guilty being raised up blind in the resurrection  as in v. 124. d  103  the object often  is omitted  and what may be indicated here is that they will have enjoyed ten centuries of great prosperity . 394 20 . ta ha â€¢ 20  105 of them in course would say  you stayed only a day . a section 6  the prophet s opponents 105 and they ask you about the mountains . say  my lord will scatter them  as scattered dust  106 then leave it a plain  smooth  level  107 on which you see no crookedness nor unevenness . 108 on that day they will follow the inviter  in whom is no crookedness  and the voices are low before the beneficent god  so that you hear nothing but a soft sound . c 109 on that day no intercession avails except of him whom the beneficent allows  and whose word he is pleased with . 110 he knows what is before them and what is behind them  while they can not encompass it in knowledge . ni and faces shall be humbled before the living  the selfsubsistent . and he who bears wrongdoing is indeed undone . 112 and whoever does good works  and is a believer  has no fear of injustice nor of the withholding of what is  his  due . 113 and thus have we sent it down an arabic quran  and have distinctly set forth in it some threats that they may guard against evil  or that it may be a reminder for them . 114 supremely exalted then is allah  the king  the truth . and do not make haste with the quran before its revelation is made complete to you  and say  my lord  increase me in knowledge . 115 and certainly we a  104  because a day is equal to a thousand years  see 2247 . it is the man who reminds them of this divine promise who is called the fairest of them in course . b  105  the word jabal means a mountain  as well as the lord or chief of a people . that the latter significance is intended here is shown by the context  see in particular v. 108   on that day they will follow the inviter  . verses 106107 are to be taken in the same sense  they point to the removal of all obstacles that hindered the advance of truth . c  108  the inviter in whom there is no crookedness is no other than the holy prophet  as is clearly stated elsewhere   praise be to allah  who revealed the book to his servant  and did not allow in it any crookedness   181  . the whole verse clearly points to a time when islam would be completely established  and instead of opposition the voices would be low before the beneficent . the low ness of the voice indicates submission . rf  114  the holy prophet no doubt desired that it should be made clear to 20  1 16 â€¢ the devil s misleading 395 gave a commandment to adam before  but he forgot  and we found in him no resolve  to disobey  .  section 7  the devil s misleading 116 and when we said to the angels  be submissive to adam  they submitted  but not iblts  he refused . 117 we said  o adam  this is an enemy to you and to your wife  so do not let him drive you both out of the garden so that you are unhappy . 118 surely it is granted to you that you are not hungry therein  nor naked  119 and that you are not thirsty therein  nor exposed to the sun s heat .  120 but the devil made an evil suggestion to him  he said  o adam  shall i lead you to the tree of immortality and a kingdom which does not decay  121 so they both ate of it  then their evil inclinations became manifest to them  and they began to cover themselves with the leaves of the garden . and adam disobeyed his lord  and was disappointed . c him how the great transformation would be brought about and when the severe opposition which he was facing would come to an end . he is here told that he should not make haste with regard to what was promised in the quran . the pro cess will be gradual and meanwhile he should pray for more and more knowledge  for it was through knowledge that this great transformation was to be brought about . even today a spiritual transformation can be brought about by spreading knowledge of the quran  which is the greatest spiritual force that the world has ever seen  and it is only on account of being ignorant of this great spiritual force that the world remains in darkness . a  115  this makes it clear that there was no intention on adam s part to disobey god s command  or no resolve to disobey . b  119  the garden of which a picture is given here is an earthly garden in which all the comforts necessary for man are made available . allegorically it sig nifies a state of contentment or rest in which there is no yearning either to good or to evil  being as it were a state of inertia  devoid of exertion or ambition . c  121  while in the picture of the garden drawn above in v. 118119 mention is made of four things  the consequence of getting out of that state is only one  their evil inclinations or their shame becoming manifest to them . an explanation of this is found in 726  where it is said   o children of adam  we have indeed sent down to you clothing to cover your shame and  clothing  for beauty  and clothing that guards against evil â€ ” that is the best  . thus it is the clothing that guards against evil that is really spoken of here  and by the manifestation of the shame is meant the consciousness of having done something evil . the allegorical 396 20 . ta ha â€¢ 20  122 122 then his lord chose him  so he turned to him and guided  him  . i 23 he said  go forth from this  state  both â€ ” all  of you  â€ ” some of you are enemies of others . surely a guidance from me will come to you  then whoever follows my guidance  he will not go astray nor be unhappy . 124 and whoever turns away from my reminder  for him is surely a  spiritually  deprived life  and we shall raise him up blind on the day of resurrection . a 125 he will say  my lord  why have you raised me up blind  while i used to see  126 he will say  thus did our messages come to you  but you neglected them . and thus are you forsaken this day . 127 and thus do we recompense him who is extravagant and does not believe in the messages of his lord . and certainly the punishment of the hereafter is severer and more lasting . 128 is it not clear to them how many of the generations  in whose dwellings they go about  we destroyed before them  surely there are signs in this for those who have understanding . section 8  punishment is certain 129 and if a word had not gone forth from your lord  and a term been fixed  it would surely have come upon them . 130 so bear patiently what they say  and celebrate the praise of your lord before the rising of the sun and before its setting  and glorify  him  during the hours of the night and parts of the day  that you may be well pleased .  131 and do not strain your eyes  with desire  at what we nature of what is so often related as the story of adam is thus evident . it will be further seen that the remedy pointed out is of a spiritual nature  as here in v. 123 124 and in 238 . this shows that the spiritual aspect of man s life and not the physical one is the real theme of adam s story . a  124  the person who shuts his eyes to the reminder leads a spiritually deprived life because he does not receive spiritual blessings . it is only a contented mind that brings ease and comfort to man  and contentment comes only through faith in god . b  130  the holy prophet  while told to bear persecutions patiently for a time  is also told to seek comfort in prayer . and he did find comfort in prayer under the severest persecutions .  the coolness of my eyes is in prayer   he is reported to have said  mishkat  25  . this verse speaks of the five obligatory prayers and the two optional ones . before the rising of the sun is the dawn prayer  jqjr   before its setting the asr prayer . three prayers  the maghrib  the isha  and the tahajjud 20132  punishment is certain 397 have provided different classes of them with â€ ” the splendour of this world s life â€ ” that we may try them by means of it . and the sustenance of your lord is better and more lasting . 132 and enjoin prayer on jour people  and steadily adhere to it . we do not ask from you a sustenance . we provide for you . and the  good  end is for guarding against evil . 133 and they say  why does he not bring us a sign from his lord  has not a clear evidence come to them of what is in the previous books  a 134 and if we had destroyed them with punish ment before it  they would have said  our lord  why did you not send to us a messenger  so that we might have followed your messages before we met disgrace and shame  135 say  everyone  of us  is waiting  so wait . soon you will come to know who is the follower of the even path and who goes aright .  the last named being optional   occur during the hours of the night  while during parts of the day are the zuhr and the duha  the latter again being optional  being a short prayer in the early forenoon . a  133  the quran is here called a clear evidence of what is contained in the previous books  because it fulfils their prophecies and corroborates their truth . chapter 21 aianmya  the prophets this chapter deals with the deliverance of the prophets  hence its title  and the ultimate triumph of their cause . it tells us that judgment on the opponents is approaching and the truth must triumph now as always . then it draws atten tion to the truth of revelation  after which it speaks of god s merciful dealing with people as this is how the holy prophet s opponents would be dealt with . next  examples of a number of prophets are cited who were delivered from their enemies . at the end we are told that the righteous will be made to inherit the land . this chapter was revealed in the early period at makkah  about or before the fifth year of the holy prophet s mission . 85 section 1  judgment approaches in the name of allah  the beneficent  the merciful . 1 their reckoning draws near to people  and they turn away in heedlessness . 2 no new reminder comes to them from their lord but they hear it while they play  3 their hearts trifling . and they â€ ” the wrongdoers â€ ” counsel in secret  he is nothing but a mortal like yourselves  will you then yield to enchantment while you see  4 he said  my lord knows  every  utterance in the heaven and the earth  and he is the hearer  the knower . 5 indeed  say they  confused dreams  rather  he has forged it  rather  he is a poet  so let him bring us a sign such as the former  prophets  were sent  with  .  6 not a town believed before them a  5  the quraish were quite puzzled  and hostile critics of the quran are still puzzled  what they could liken the quran to . they first call it sihr  i.e.  skilful eloquence  because  despite their opposition to it  it had an attraction for them . but then there are prophecies which mere eloquence can not produce  so they call it confused dreams or medleys of dreams . then they think that there is a settled purpose in it  by reason of its asserting the prophet  s triumph and the discomfiture of his powerful enemies  so they call it an intentional forgery  and lastly  as if to devise one word combining all these  they call him a poet . then they demand a sign like one given to the former prophets  meaning their destruction  because the 398 217  judgment approaches 399 which we destroyed  will they then believe   7 and we did not send before you any but men to whom we sent revelation  so ask the followers of the reminder if you do not know . 8 nor did we give them bodies not eating food  nor did they live forever .  then we made our promise good to them  so we delivered them and whom we pleased  and we destroyed the extravagant . 10 certainly we have revealed to you a book which will give you eminence . do you not then understand  â° section 2  truth has always triumphed 11 and how many a town which was unjust did we demolish  and we raised up after it another people  12 so when they felt our might  lo  they began to flee from it . 13 do not flee and return to the easy lives which you led  and to your dwellings  that you may be questioned . 14 they said  o woe to us  surely we were unjust . 15 and this cry of theirs did not cease till we made them cut off  extinct . 16 and we did not create the heaven and the earth and all that is between them for sport . 17 if we had wished to take a pastime  we would have taken it from before ourselves  by no means quran had repeatedly called their attention to the fate of those who had rejected the truth before them . a  6  they are told in reply that persistence in wickedness and disbelief has always been punished with destruction . b  8  thus every prophet had a mortal body needing food for its support  and every one of them tasted of death . therefore jesus also must have had a body which stood in need of food and must have tasted of death . the idea that he is alive is clearly opposed to this verse . c  10  whenever the opponents demand that the threatened punishment should come  the reply always is that the quran is a blessing and a mercy for them . the same truth is expressed here . they are told that the quran has been revealed to make them a great and eminent nation in the world . dhikr means eminence  fame  renown  honour as well as reminder . also see 2152 footnote . d  16  they were made to witness signs of the truth of the prophet and they are now told to bear in mind that these signs were not in vain . in nature every cause has an effect and every end is achieved by means . life must be taken seriously  not as a jest . 400 21 . the prophets  21  18 would we do  so  . 18 indeed  we hurl the truth against falsehood  so it knocks out its brains  and lo  it vanishes .  and woe to you for what you describe  19 and to him belongs whoever is in the hea vens and the earth . and those who are with him are not too proud to serve him  nor are they weary . 20 they glorify  him  night and day â€ ” they do not tire . 21 or have they taken gods from the earth who give life  22 if there were in them gods besides allah  they would both have been in disorder . so glory be to allah  the lord of the throne  being above what they describe  23 he can not be questioned as to what he does  and they will be questioned . 24 0r  have they taken gods besides him  say  bring your proof . this is the reminder of those with me and the reminder of those before me .  but most of them do not know the truth  so they turn away . 25 and we sent no messenger before you but we revealed to him that there is no god but me  so serve me . 26 and they say  the beneficent has taken to himself a son . glory be to him  no  they are honoured servants â€ ” 27 they do not speak before he speaks  and according to his command a  18  mark the deep conviction of the prophet as to the ultimate triumph of truth in the world . truth had dawned on his mind in full resplendence . the forces of darkness and falsehood  which were uppermost in arabia when these words were uttered  were brought to naught in his lifetime and  however powerful they may appear to be  they can not even today make a stand before the onward march of truth . b  22  there is order in the universe because one law pervades the whole of it  and one law clearly points to one author and maintainer of that law . note that here allah is spoken of as rabb al arsh  the nourisher to perfection or lord of the throne  so that the throne itself is sustained by god  and it is not god who is sustained by the throne . c  24  the great and fundamental truth of the unity of allah is common to all religions  no prophet ever taught polytheism . d  26  refuting the doctrine that jesus is the son of god  it is added that they are honoured servants . the words draw attention to the fact that others besides jesus were spoken of as the sons of god  but that the title signified nothing more than that they were honoured servants  and that therefore jesus was the son of god exactly in the same sense . 2128  truth of revelation 401 they act .  28 he knows what is before them and what is behind them  and they do not intercede except for him whom he approves  and for fear of him they tremble . 29 and whoever of them should say  i am a god besides him  such a one we recompense with hell . thus we reward the unjust . section 3  truth of revelation 30 do not those who disbelieve see that the heavens and the earth were closed up  so we split them apart . and we made from water everything living . will they not then believe  31 and we made firm mountains in the earth in case it should quake with them  and we made in it wide ways that they might follow a right direction . 32 and we have made the heaven a guarded canopy  a  27  this verse affords a conclusive testimony for the sinlessness of pro phets . in the first place they do not speak till allah has spoken  i.e.  they speak according to what he has taught them  not speaking of their own accord . and secondly  when they act  they act according to his commandment . thus both their words and deeds are in accordance with divine will  and therefore sin or dis obedience of god can not be attributed to them . the context shows clearly that the verse speaks of prophets  and not of angels . b  301  the heavens and the earth may stand here for the whole universe  or for the solar system in particular  which has developed out of a nebular mass  and the separation may refer to the starry creation or to the throwing off of the planets of the solar system  and the great symmetry of its arrangement and the motions of the various bodies . there is a reference to the orbits of the various planets further on in v. 33 . but there may also be a deeper allusion in the closing up of the heavens and the earth to the cessation of divine revelation for a time before the advent of the holy prophet  which was marked by the absence of a prophet in the world for six hundred years and the prevalence of corruption all over the world . the opening up of the heavens and the earth would in this case signify the coming of revelation  which brought life to the world . in physical nature too  rain opens up the earth . c  302  while this statement reveals a remarkable truth in the physical world  a truth which science has established only recently  that water is the source of all life  it draws attention to the equally remarkable spiritual truth that it is only by divine revelation  which is again and again compared with water in the quran  that life is given to a world otherwise dead in sin and corruption . rf  31  see 1615 and footnote . the first part of the verse may also be transla ted as we made firm mountains in the earth that they might be a source of benefit 402 21 . the prophets â€¢ 21  33 yet they turn away from its signs .  33 and he it is who created the night and the day and the sun and the moon . all float in orbits . 34 and we did not grant living forever to any mortal before you . if you die  will they live forever  35 every soul must taste of death . and we test you by evil and good by way of trial . and to us you are returned .  36 and when those who disbelieve see you  they treat you only with mockery  is this he who speaks of your gods  and they deny when the beneficent god is mentioned 37 man is created of haste . soon will i show you my signs  so ask me not to hasten them . 38 and they say  when will this promise come to pass  if you are truthful  6 39 if those who disbelieve only knew the time when they will not be able to ward off the fire from their faces  nor from their backs  and they will not be helped  40 indeed  it will come to them all of a sudden and stun them  so they will not have the power to avert it  nor will they be given respite . 41 and messengers before you were indeed mocked  but that which they mocked at befell those of them who scoffed . to you . compare 793233 . in the latter part there may be a deeper reference to the ways pointed out by prophets among every nation . a  32  arabia had its spiritualists  astrologers and diviners who pretended to have access to the secrets of heaven  see 675 . they are told that they can not have any such access . or  the meaning is that revelation from god  called here heaven  is guarded against all attacks . b  35  they were afflicted with small evils  and the removal of these again brought to them a turn of good events . all this was by way of trial  the greater punishment  which was to bring about the final overthrow of their power  was yet in store for them . c  36  the arabs would not call allah by the name alrahman  see also 17110 and 2560   hence the beneficent god is here spoken of in contrast with the idols . d  37  so prominent is the characteristic of haste in man that he may be said to have been created  as it were  of haste . e  38  the particular sign which they again and again demanded was that a destructive punishment like that which overtook former people should overtake them .   41  the rejectors of truth have always scoffed at the idea of being punish ed . this and the two preceding verses assert in the most forcible words that truth will finally triumph . 21  42 â€¢ allah deals with people mercifully 403 section 4  allah deals with people mercifully 42 say  who guards you by night and by day from the bene ficent   but they turn away at the mention of their lord . 43 0r  have they gods who can defend them against us  they can not help themselves  nor can they be defended from us . 44 indeed  we gave provision to these and their fathers  until life was prolonged to them . do they not see then that we are visiting the land  curtailing it of its sides  can they then prevail  45 say  i warn you only by revelation  and the deaf do not hear the call when they are warned . 46 and if a blast of the punishment of your lord were to touch them  they would say  o woe to us  surely we were unjust . 47 and we will set up a just balance on the day of resurrection  so no soul will be wronged in the least . and if there were the weight of a grain of mustard seed  we will bring it . and sufficient are we to take account . 48 and certainly we gave moses and aaron the criterion and a light and a reminder for those who guard against evil  49 who fear their lord in secret and they are fearful of the hour . 50 and this is a blessed reminder  which we have revealed . will you then deny it  section 5  abraham is delivered 51 and certainly we gave abraham his rectitude before  and we knew him well . 52 when he said to his sire and his people  what are these images to whose worship you are devoted  53 they said  we found our fathers worshipping them . 54 he said  certainly you have been  you and your fathers  in manifest error . 55 they said  have you brought us the truth  or are you a jester  56 he said  a  42  that is  if allah were not beneficent to you and guarded you  there is none who could guard you . or if he  despite his beneficence  were to punish you because of your persistence in evil to such a degree as to call for the wrath of even a beneficent master  there would be none to guard you against that punishment . b  48  the criterion given to moses was that he was delivered from the hands of a most powerful enemy . the last verse of the section predicts that a similar sign would be shown in the case of the prophet muhammad . 404 21 . the prophets â€¢ 21  57 indeed  your lord is the lord of the heavens and the earth  who created them  and i am one of the bearers of witness to this . 57 and  by allah  i will certainly plan against your idols after you go away  turning your backs . 58 so he broke them into pieces  except the chief of them  that perhaps they might return to it .  59 they said  who has done this to our gods  surely he is one of the wrongdoers . 60  some  said  we heard a youth  who is called abraham  speak of them . 61 they said  then bring him before the people s eyes  perhaps they may bear witness . 62 they said  have you done this to our gods  abra ham  63 he said  surely  someone  has done it . the chief of them is this  so ask them  if they can speak . 64 then they turned to themselves and said  surely you yourselves are wrongdoers  65 then they were made to hang down their heads  c you know indeed that they do not speak . 66 he said  do you then serve besides allah what does you no good  nor harms you  67 enough of you and what you serve besides allah  have you no sense  68 they said  burn him  and help your gods  if you are going to do  anything  . 69 we said  o fire  be coolness and peace for a  58  the story of abraham s breaking the idols is related in jewish rabbi nical literature . b  63  these words do not mean  no  he has done it  this chief of them  . there is a pause after the words  has done it  and the statement  the chief of them is this  is an independent statement . thus the first words mean some doer has done it . the particle bal occurring before these words often denotes and or surely . the idols were taken as gods yet they were not able to help themselves . they were shattered to pieces  yet they could do no harm to their shatterer . nor could they even tell their votaries who was responsible for this . it should be further noted that abraham never tried to conceal what he had done . in fact  before brea king the idols he had warned the people that he would plan against their idols  see v. 57 . the object of sparing the chief idol was  as made clear in v. 58  that perhaps they might return to it . the chief was yet safe  they should have argued within themselves  why not pray to him to find out who broke the others . this is hinted at in v. 64  where they are made to confess their own wrongdoing in wor shipping things which could do them no good or harm  v. 66  . c  65  they were made to hang down their heads on account of shame  for their deities proved so helpless as to be unable to name even the person who did them injury . 21  70 â€¢ allah always delivers prophets 405 abraham   70 and they intended a plan against him  but we made them the greater losers . 71 and we delivered him and lot  direct ing them  to the land which we had blessed for the nations . 72 and we gave him isaac  and jacob  a son s son . and we made  them  all good . 73 and we made them leaders who guided  people  by our command  and we revealed to them the doing of good and the keeping up of prayer and the giving of charity  and us  alone  they served  74 and to lot we gave wisdom and knowledge  and we delivered him from the town which committed wicked deeds . surely they were an evil people  transgressors  75 and we admitted him to our mercy  surely he was from among the righteous . section 6  allah always delivers prophets 76 and noah  when he cried before  this   so we answered him  and delivered him and his people from the great calamity . 77 and we helped him against the people who rejected our mess ages . surely they were an evil people  so we drowned them all . 78 and david and solomon  when they gave judgment con cerning the field  when the people s sheep strayed into it by night  and we were bearers of witness to their judgment . 79 so we made solomon to understand it . and to each  of them  we gave wisdom and knowledge . and we made the mountains  declaring  our  glory  and the birds  subservient to david .  and we were the doers . a  69  the fire was turned into coolness and peace for abraham . the quran does not state anywhere that abraham was actually cast into a fire . his opponents had no doubt decided to burn him  as stated here  or to kill him or burn him  2924  . but here in v. 70 as well as in 3798  we are told in clear words that they intended a plan against him  but we made them the greater losers  v. 70   or we brought them low  3798  . this shows that their plan was ineffective . according to 2924  allah delivered him from the fire  before being thrown into or after being thrown into it  it does not say . v. 71 states that the delivery was brought about by means of a journey to another land . it was thus a flight to another place like the holy prophet s flight to madinah  and in the history of abraham there is a deeper reference to the history of the prophet himself . b  79  elsewhere it is stated that everything that exists in the heavens or the earth is made subservient to man  4513   and on various occasions it is mentioned that the rivers  the sea  the sun and the moon  night and day  etc.  are made 406 21 . the prophets  2180 80 and we taught him the making of coats of mail for you  to protect you in your wars  will you then be grateful  81 and to solomon  we subdued  the wind blowing violent  pursuing its course by his command to the land which we had blessed  and we are ever knower of all things.  82 and of the devils there were those who dived for him and did other work besides that  and we kept guard over them  83 and job  when he cried to his lord  distress has afflicted me  and you are the most merciful of those who show mercy  84 so we responded to him and removed the distress he had  and we gave him  back  his people and more like them with them  a mercy from us and a reminder to the worshippers . c 85 and ishmael and idrls and dhu1kifl  all were from subservient to man  1612  1614  132  etc.  . this explains the meaning of making mountains and birds subservient to david . a thing is said to be made subservient to a man when he can use it to his advantage . note further that every thing in the heavens and the earth declares the glory of allah  1744  . but see 3410  where a similar statement occurs and may refer to the conquests of david . a  81  solomon s fleet did him an important service  and this is what is meant by the wind being made subservient to solomon . also compare 1432   and he has made the ships subservient to you  to run their course in the sea by his command  . b  82  elsewhere we have   and the devils  every builder and diver  and others fettered in chains   383738  . solomon employed foreigners  whom he had subdued  to do the work of divers and builders . the word shaitan  or devil  signifies one who is excessively proud  rebellious or audacious . see further 3838. c  84  job is again mentioned after solomon in greater detail in 384144 . there also he is spoken of as being given his people  ahl  and more like them with them . there  however  we have clear indications that the distress spoken of here relates to some journey which he undertook in connection with his mission . as a result of this journey he lost  or was separated from  his people . it seems that he had to flee to some place of safety  and he ultimately found not only his own people but others like them  i.e.  he had other believers in him in his place of refuge . the story of job as given in the quran is really a prophetical statement relating to the prophet s own flight from makkah to madinah  where he met with not only his makkan followers but also believers in madinah in about the same number . d  85  the commentators differ in identifying dhu4kifl with one of the biblical prophets  zacharias  elias  or joshua . a more sound suggestion is that he 21  86 â€¢ allah always delivers prophets 407 among the patient ones  86 and we admitted them to our mercy  surely they were from among the good ones . 87 and dhu1nun  a when he went away in anger   and he thought that we would not constrain him  e so he called out among afflictions  d there is no god but you  glory be to you  surely i am a sufferer of loss . 6 88 so we responded to him and delivered him from grief . and thus do we deliver the believers . 89 and zacharias  when he cried to his lord  my lord  do not leave me alone and you are the best is ezekiel . this prophet is mentioned only once again  as here without any reference to his history  in 3848 .  editor s note  dhulkifl may stand for dhul kipl  as the letter  is represented by in arabic  there being no p in the arabic alphabet . dhulkipl would mean he who belongs to kapila  this being the name of the town in ancient india to which buddha belonged . according to the clear teachings of the quran  prophets and messengers of god were sent to every nation  and there is not a people but a warner has gone among them  â€ ” 3524  see also 1047  4164 and 4078 . buddha s life and teachings  and his great following  lead us to infer that he was a messenger of god in quranic terms .  a  871  dhu1nun is another name for jonah  the arabic equivalent of the latter being yunus  by which name the prophet is mentioned in 686  1098 and 37139 . nun means a big fish  and dhulnun therefore means lord of the fish . in a very early revelation  jonah is spoken of as the companion of the fish  6848  . both these titles seem to be taken from the incident of the fish  see 37142. b  872  evidently what is meant is that he was angry with his people and left them for another place . a prophet s being angry with god is simply unimagi nable . moreover he is spoken of here as going away  while no man could think of going away from the presence of the omnipresent . he was wroth with his people because of their stubbornness . see also 37140. c  873  finding his people stubborn  he went away from them and was wroth with them and thought  or rather knew  zanna   that some way would be opened for him to bring people to guidance somewhere . these words may also mean  he thought we would not decree against him . d  874  literally  darkness . difficulty is compared to darkness because of the inability of a person to find his way when in difficulty  as when in darkness . e  875  the word zulm may mean anything from the slightest falling off from one s duty to the greatest transgression . it is used sometimes in a good sense when a man imposes upon himself a heavy duty to please god . jonah is here spoken of as being of the zalimin  one of the sufferers of loss  in the sense of making himself suffer a loss by going away from his original place  or of having failed in doing justice to the message with which he was entrusted . 408 21 . the prophets â€¢ 21  90 of inheritors  90 so we responded to him and gave him john and made his wife fit for him .  surely they used to hasten in  doing  good deeds and called upon us  hoping and fearing  and they were humble before us . 91 and she who guarded her chastity so we breathed into her of our inspiration  and made her and her son a sign for the nations . 92 surely this your community is a single community  and i am your lord  so serve me . 93 and they split apart their unity  to us will all return . section 7  the righteous will inherit the land 94 so whoever does good deeds and is a believer  there is no rejection of his effort  and we surely write  it  down for him . 95 and it is forbidden to a town which we destroy  they shall not return . 6 96 even when gog and magog are let loose and they sally forth from every elevated placed 97 and the true promise draws near  then the eyes of those who disbelieve will be fixedly open  o woe to us  surely we were heedless of this  indeed  we a  89  that is  one who will remain after all have perished . b  90  by fitness is meant fitness to bear a child  because she was thought to be barren . c  91  mary  the mother of jesus  is meant here . nothing is said about immaculate conception here . the guarding of chastity does not preclude the law ful union of husband and wife . d  92  the basic principle of all religions taught by the prophets has been one and the same in all ages and all countries  that allah is the lord of all and he alone must be served . therefore all prophets are here declared to be one comm unity  they all led people to virtue through service to god . but  as the next verse shows  their followers broke off this unity . e  95  the verse reveals the great truth that those who are made to taste of death are not sent back into this world .   961  the previous verse contains a prohibition against the return to life of those who are dead  or the rise of nations that are once destroyed . this one points out that even gog and magog  despite their predominance in the whole world  will follow the same law . the word hatta can mean even as well as until . g  962  for gog and magog  see 1894 and footnote . the words they sally forth from every elevated place mean that they will take possession of every point of vantage and convenience  so as to dominate the whole world . see further 1898 and footnote . 21  98 â€¢ the righteous will inherit the land 409 were unjust .  98 surely you and what you worship besides allah are fuel of hell  to it you will come .  if these had been gods  they would not have come to it . and all will abide in it . iâ°â°for them therein is groaning and in it they do not hear . e 101 those for whom the good  end  has already gone forth from us  they will be kept far off from it â€ ” 102 they will not hear the faintest sound of it and they will abide in that which their souls desire . 6 103 the great terror will not grieve them  and the angels will meet them  this is your day which you were promised . 104 the day when we roll up heaven like the rolling up of the scroll of writings . as we began the first creation  we shall reproduce it . a promise  binding  on us . we shall bring it about a  97  the true promise that draws near with the domination of gog and magog is the promise of the ultimate triumph of truth   he it is who has sent his messenger with guidance and the religion of truth that he may make it prevail over all religions   933  . this is also referred to in 1899  after speaking of the great conflict of gog and magog  in the words then we shall gather them all to gether . thus the time when gog and magog overcome the whole world is also the time when truth will gain ground and prevail over the whole earth . materialism would first spread over the whole world  but would prove a failure . then would spiritual truth shine and people would feel that they had not only been heedless to it  but even unjust in trying to suppress it . b  98  compare 18100   and we shall bring forth hell  exposed to view  on that day before the disbelievers  . c  100  those who turn a deaf ear to the truth here shall be raised deaf in the life after death  and therefore they do not hear . d  101  this verse totally refutes the false idea that even the righteous will first go to hell . they will not even hear its faintest sound  as the next verse states . e  102  it is the bliss of communion with god which the souls of the righteous long for  so it is that bliss in which they shall live in the hereafter .   104  the rolling up of the heaven like a written scroll means that the old order will be swept away altogether  just as when a writing is finished  it is rolled up . this no doubt happened in arabia at the appearance of the holy prophet . but then follows the statement  as we began the first creation  we shall reproduce it . the sweeping away of the old order no doubt meant that a new order would be created . this is the first creation referred to here â€ ” the bringing about of a new order at the prophet s appearance . and then we are told that the new order will be reproduced again . this reproduction is in reference to what has been earlier stated â€ ” that gog and magog will dominate the whole world . the spiritual resuscitation 410 21 . the prophets 21105 105 and certainly we wrote in the book after the reminder that my righteous servants will inherit the land .  106 surely in this is a message for a people who serve  us  . 107 and we have not sentyou but as a mercy to the nations . 108 say  it is only revealed to me that your god is one god  will you then submit  109 but if they turn back  say  i have warned you in fairness  and i do not know whether what you are promised is near or far . 110 surely he knows what is spoken openly and he knows what you hide . ni and i do not know if this may be a trial for you and a provision till a time . 112 he said  my lord  judge with truth . and our lord is the beneficent  whose help is sought against what you ascribe  to him  . to which islam gave rise would thus receive a setback by the predominance of a material outlook of the world through the prevalence of gog and magog  but this setback  we are here told  would be only temporary  and a spiritual awakening like the first spiritual awakening would then be brought about in the whole world . this statement is followed by the words  a promise binding on us . the promise of the ultimate triumph of truth in the whole world is of frequent occurrence in the quran in earlier as well as in later revelation  and the temporary setback indi cated here is also frequently mentioned  and on one occasion at least it is made fully clear that it will be a setback extending over a thousand years  325  . a  105  the quran had repeatedly warned the disbelievers that islam would be made triumphant in the land  and the righteous servants who were made to suffer persecution would one day be masters of the land . but as already noted  it is of the whole world that the quran is speaking and we are here told that truth will ulti mately triumph in the whole world  which would thus be inherited by the righteous . this is made clear in v. 107. b  107  while the words no doubt contain a reference to the merciful dealing with the prophet s opponents  the real significance is that the prophet s advent will prove a mercy not only to the arabs by making them a foremost nation in the world  but to the whole of humanity . the prophet s being a mercy to the nations of the world  is to show that ultimately all nations will be received into the divine mercy which was manifested through him . already the teachings of the quran have not only benefited its followers  but even those who still reject its message  for  despite their rejection of it  they have accepted many of its principles . chapter 22 aihajj the pilgrimage this chapter is called the pilgrimage because the proclamation of pilgrimage  originally made by abraham  was now repeated by the holy prophet and addressed to the whole world . it opens with the prophecy of a terrible calamity  which is a preliminary to the triumph of truth . then it asserts the certainty of divine help for the believers and their consequent triumph . as their triumph would involve the conquest of makkah  the chapter then deals with the topics of the sacred house  the pilgrimage and sacrifice . the subject of fighting is then introduced  requiring sacrifices to be made . then it tells us that  despite opposition  the faithful would be established in the land  but as allah s deal ing with the opponents is merciful their punishment would be withheld for a while . at the end it declares that polytheism would be uprooted . this chapter was revealed in the late period at makkah . section 1  the judgment in the name of allah  the beneficent  the merciful . 1 o people  keep your duty to your lord  surely the shock of the hour is a grievous thing .  2 the day you see it  every woman giving suck will forget her suckling and every pregnant one will lay down her burden  and you will see people as drunken  yet they will not be drunken  but the punishment of allah will be severe . 3 and some people dispute about allah without knowledge  and follow every rebellious devil â€ ” 4 for him it is written that who ever takes him for a friend  he will lead him astray and conduct him to the punishment of the burning fire . a  1  in the quran  alsa ah or the hour does not necessarily imply the day of judgment . it often implies the time of judgment in this life  the time when the threatened doom overtakes a people  and this seems to be the significance here . some consider that a severe shaking of the earth is meant as a sign of the approach of the great judgment  but even in that case it might imply any terrible calamity  such as a great war . b  3  the devil here is  as frequently in the quran  the devil in human form . 411 412 22 . the pilgrimage â€¢ 22  5 5 o people  if you are in doubt about the resurrection  then surely we created you from dust  then from a small lifegerm  then from a clot  then from a lump of flesh  complete in make and incomplete  that we may make clear to you . e and we cause what we please to remain in the wombs till an appointed time  then we bring you forth as babies  then that you may attain your maturity . and some of you are caused to die  while some of you are brought back to the worst part of life  knowing nothing after having know ledge . and you see the earth barren  but when we send down water upon it  it stirs and swells and brings forth a beautiful  growth  of every kind . 6 6 that is because allah  he is the truth  and he gives life to the dead  and he is powerful over all things  7 and the hour is coming  there is no doubt about it  and allah will raise up those who are in the graves . 8 and some people dispute about allah without knowledge  a  51  the word ba th  raising  or as  resurrection  here  is used in three senses in the quran   1  the raising of the dead to life according to their good or evil deeds on the judgment day   2  the raising of the spiritually dead to life by the prophets  and  3  the raising up of prophets by allah for the guidance of man kind . the word as used here may include the denial of all these three cases . the argument contained in this and the following verses is equally applicable to all  but it most prominently refers to the spiritual resurrection of the dead . b  52  these words explain the meaning of adam s or man s creation from dust  which is frequently referred to in the quran  for all people are here spoken of as being created from dust . man s creation from dust implies the ultimate springing of all life from earth . c  53  the various stages through which every human child passes are spoken of here  showing how humble is his origin . or  the reference may be to the various stages through which man has passed in his evolution to the present stage of perfection . attention is thus drawn to the fact that  just as the physical evolu tion of man is gradual  so is his spiritual growth and development . d  54  by the worst part of life is meant dotage and decrepitude . e  55  the stirring and swelling of the earth means its stirring and swelling with the growth of herbage . compare 4139 . the illustration draws attention to the fact that revelation quickens dead hearts as rain quickens dead earth .   7  compare 3522   surely allah makes whom he pleases hear  and you can not make those hear who are in the graves  . the significance is that even the incorrigible will be raised to a spiritual life . 22  9 â€¢ certainty of divine help 413 and without guidance  and without an illuminating book  9  such a person  turning away haughtily to lead  others  astray from the way of allah . for him is disgrace in this world  and on the day of resurrection we shall make him taste the punishment of burning . 10 this is for what jour two hands have sent ahead  and allah is not in the least unjust to the servants . section 2  certainty of divine help 11 and some people serve allah   standing  on the verge   so if good befalls such a one he is satisfied with it  but if a trial afflicts him he turns back headlong . he loses this world and the hereafter . that is a manifest loss . 12 he calls besides allah on something which can not harm him  nor benefit him  that is straying far . 13 he calls on him whose harm is nearer than his benefit . certainly an evil guardian and an evil associate  14 surely allah will make those who believe and do good deeds enter gardens in which rivers flow . allah indeed does what he pleases . 15 whoever thinks that allah will not assist him in this life and the hereafter  let him raise  himself  by some means to the heaven  then let him cut  it  off  then let him see if his plan will take away what he is enraged at .  16 and thus have we revealed it  clear arguments  and allah guides whom he will . 17 those who believe and those who are jews and the sabians and the christians and the magians and those who set up partners  with allah  â€ ” surely allah will decide between them on the day a  11  this expression indicates the attitude of a man who wavers  being ready to quit the faith on any pretence . b  15  the prophecies of the final triumph of the truth and of the coming of divine assistance to the holy prophet were repeatedly declared in the quran  and the disbelievers were enraged at this . they are told that the divine assistance must come  and that they should leave no stone unturned in their struggle against it  insomuch that  if they could  they should rise to heaven and cut off all heavenly or divine assistance from the prophet . or  the meaning may be that they may carry their anger to the greatest possible extreme and be driven to the utmost desperation  yet they will be unable to stop the coming of divine help to the prophet . 414 22 . the pilgrimage â€¢ 22  18 of resurrection . surely allah is witness over all things .  18 do you not see that to allah makes submission whoever is in the heavens and whoever is in the earth  and the sun and the moon and the stars  and the mountains and the trees  and the animals and many of the people  and many there are to whom punishment is due . and he whom allah disgraces  none can give him honour . surely allah does what he pleases . 19 these are two adversaries who dispute about their lord . so those who disbelieve  for them are cut out garments of fire . boiling water will be poured out over their heads . 20 with it will be melted what is in their bellies and  their  skins as well . 21 and for them are whips of iron . 22 whenever they desire to go out from it  from grief  they are turned back into it  and  it is said   taste the punishment of burning . section 3  believers are triumphant 23 surely allah will make those who believe and do good deeds enter gardens in which rivers flow â€ ” they are adorned therein with bracelets of gold and  with  pearls . and their garments therein are of silk . e 24 and they are guided to pure words  and they are guided to the path of the praised one . 25 those who disbelieve and hinder  people  from allah s way and from the sacred mosque  a  17  it is implied that differences in religious beliefs do not call for punish ment in this life  these will be decided on the day of judgment . punishment in this life is brought upon those who work mischief and transgress all limits in doing evil . b  22  min ghammin   from grief   explains minha   from it    and thus explains the nature of the punishment in this and the previous verse . it is a grief which will constantly burn their souls so as to melt them . c  23  the following incident  mentioned by baihaqi  shows that the compa nions of the prophet understood these prophecies in another sense too   the bracelets of kisra  the persian monarch  were brought to umar  and he made suraqa ibn malik to wear them  on which he praised the almighty  . the reason for umar making suraqa wear the bracelets is also given by the same authority in another report  according to which the holy prophet had said to suraqa   how will you feel when you wear the bracelets of kisra   2226 pilgrimage 415 which we have made equally for all people   for  the dweller in it and the visitor .  and whoever inclines to wrong in it  unjustly  we shall make him taste of painful punishment . section 4  pilgrimage 26 and when we pointed to abraham the place of the house  saying  do not set up any partner with me  and purify my house for those who make circuits and stand to pray and bow and pros trate themselves . 27 and proclaim to mankind the pilgrimage  6 they will come to you on foot and on every lean camel  coming from every remote path  c 28 that they may witness benefits  provided  for them  and mention the name of allah on appointed days over the cattle quadrupeds that he has given them  then eat of them and feed the distressed one  the needy . 29 then let them accomplish their needful acts of cleansing  and let them fulfil their vows and go round the ancient house . 2 a  25  the two may respectively signify the dweller in makkah and the dweller in the desert  or one who dwells in it constantly and one who comes to it occasionally . the disbelievers  being then in possession of the sacred mosque  prevented muslims from using it . they are told that this state of things will be brought to an end  for it must be open to all visitors  and that could only be brought about by muslims being made masters of it . b  271  the words are addressed to the holy prophet  and contain a mighty prophecy that makkah will become the centre to which people will come for pil grimage . it was announced just at the time when the holy prophet was being driven away from makkah by his enemies . just when makkah seemed to have lost every chance of becoming a muslim centre  and when muslims themselves were in danger of being entirely destroyed  a mighty prophecy is announced in the most forcible words that islam will spread to all countries of the world  and makkah will become the universal centre to which pilgrims from all nations will come . c  272  the lean camel is particularly mentioned here to indicate the great distances from which pilgrims would come . the addition of the words from every remote path shows that people will come from the remotest parts of the earth . d  28  the subject of sacrifice is one that is specially related to the pilgri mage  because every pilgrim must sacrifice an animal . thus it is the lesson of sacrifice that is taught in pilgrimage . the act of the pilgrim finds an echo through out the muslim world  for every muslim who can afford is required to sacrifice an animal on this occasion  and this subject is discussed in the next section . e  29  the mention of the kabah as the ancient house  here and in v. 33  416 22 . the pilgrimage â€¢ 22  30 30 that  shall be so  . and whoever respects the sacred ordi nances of allah  it is good for him with his lord . and the cattle are made lawful for you  except what is recited to you  so shun the filth of the idols and shun false words  31 being upright for allah  not setting up partners with him . and whoever sets up partners with allah  it is as if he had fallen from on high  then the birds had snatched him away  or the wind had carried him off to a distant place . 32 that  shall be so  . and whoever respects the ordinances of allah  this is surely from the piety of hearts . 33 in them are bene fits for you for a term appointed  then their place of sacrifice is the ancient house . section 5  sacrifices 34 and for every nation we appointed acts of devotion that they might mention the name of allah on the cattle quadrupeds that he has given them . so your god is one god  therefore to him should you submit .  and give good news to the humble  35 whose hearts tremble when allah is mentioned  and who are patient in their afflictions  and who keep up prayer  and spend  on good works  out of what we have given them . 6 shows that it is so old that it came to be known throughout arabia by that name  thus pointing to its very remote antiquity  see 2125. a  34  the principle of sacrifice is one which is accepted in one form or another by all nations of the world  but it has a deeper meaning in islam . the out ward act is still there but it no more conveys the meaning attached to it in ancient religions  viz.  that of appeasing an offended deity  or that of serving as an atone ment for sins . it signifies the sacrifice of the sacrificer himself  and becomes thus an outward symbol of his readiness to lay down his life  if required  and to sacrifice all his interests and desires in the cause of truth . hence it is that words intro ducing the subject of sacrifice are immediately followed by an injunction to submit oneself entirely to allah  who is the one god  i.e.  the only being who deserves to be made the true object of one s love . b  35  it is by the mention of allah s name that an animal is sacrificed  and the meaning underlying it is that their own hearts should tremble at the mention of that name . thus they should bear in mind  when sacrificing an animal over which they hold control  how much more necessary it is that they should lay down their lives in the way of allah  who holds control over all . hence a verse speaking of sacrifices is immediately followed by one which requires the exercise of great patience and endurance under hard trials by the faithful . 2236 pilgrimage 417 36 and the camels  we have made them from among the signs appointed by allah for you  â€ ” in them there is much good for you . so mention the name of allah on them standing in a row . then when they fall down on their sides  eat of them and feed the con tented one and the beggar . thus have we made them subservient to you that you may be grateful . 37 not their flesh  nor their blood  reaches allah  but to him is acceptable the observance of duty on your part . c thus has he made them subservient to you  that you may magnify allah for guiding you aright . and give good news to those who do good  to others  . 38 surely allah defends those who believe . surely allah does not love anyone who is unfaithful  ungrateful . section 6  believers permitted to fight 39 permission  to fight  is given to those on whom war is made  because they are oppressed . and surely allah is able to assist them 6 â€ ” 40 those who are driven from their homes without a just a  361  the camels which are brought for sacrifice to makkah by the pil grims are here stated to be only outward signs of the true religion of allah  that religion being no other than the religion of entire submission to allah and of lay ing down all one has  even one s life  in the way of allah . b  362  the flesh of the animals sacrificed is not to be wasted  but it should serve as food for the poor and the needy . c  37  it is not the outward act of sacrifice which is acceptable  but the deep meaning of sacrifice which underlies it . the idea of atonement is quite foreign to islamic sacrifice . it is the righteous whom islam requires to sacrifice  as hinted at in the words  to him is acceptable the observance of duty on your part . d  38  a new subject is now introduced  the subject of fighting in the way of allah . this sheds light upon the connection which exists between the two sub jects . after dealing with the subject of sacrifice theoretically  the muslim has in fact been prepared to bring into practice the theory of the sacrifice . hence he is told that the time is near when he will be required to lay down his very life in the defence of truth  which the opponents were striving to exterminate . therefore  the subject of fighting in the cause of truth is a fitting sequel to the subject of sacrifice  as casting further light upon the inner meaning of sacrifice  and also requiring that doctrine to be carried into practice . e  39  this is the earliest permission given to the muslims to fight . the words in which the permission is granted show clearly that war was first made on 418 22 . the pilgrimage â€¢ 22  41 cause except that they say  our lord is allah . and if allah did not repel some people by others  surely cloisters and churches and syna gogues  and mosques in which allah s name is much remembered  would have been pulled down . and surely allah will help him who helps him . surely allah is strong  mighty .  41 those who  if we establish them in the land  will keep up prayer and give the due charity and enjoin good and forbid evil . and allah s is the end of  all  affairs . 42 and if they reject you  already before them did the people of noah and ad and thamud reject  prophets   43 and the people of abraham and the people of lot  44 and the dwellers of midian . and moses  too  was rejected . but i gave respite to the disbelievers  then i seized them  so how  severe  was my disapproval  45 how many a town we destroyed while it was unjust  so it is fallen down upon its roofs  and  how many  a deserted well and palace raised high  46 have they not travelled in the land so that they should have hearts with which to understand  or ears with which to hear  for surely it is not the eyes that are blind  but blind are the hearts which are in the breasts .  47 and they ask you to hasten on the punishment  and allah by no means fails in his promise . and surely a day with your lord is like a thousand years as you the muslims by their opponents  and secondly  that the muslims had already suffered great oppression at the hands of their persecutors . the words of the next verse  those who are driven from their homes  may refer to the emigration to abyssinia  or to the exodus to madinah  which commenced soon afterwards . a  40  the religious freedom established by islam has not yet been surpassed by the most civilized and tolerant of nations . it deserves to be noted that the lives of muslims are to be sacrificed not only to stop their own persecution by their opponents and to save their own mosques  but to save churches  synagogues and cloisters as well â€ ” in fact  to establish perfect religious freedom . mosques  though they are the places where the name of allah is remembered most of all  are mentioned after churches and synagogues . early muslims closely followed these directions  and every commander of an army had express orders to respect all houses of worship  and even the cloisters of monks  along with their inmates . b  46  the quran very often speaks of the blind  the deaf and the dead  meaning thereby the spiritually blind  deaf and dead  as it has plainly stated here . 2248  opposition to the prophet 419 count .  48 and how many a town to which i gave respite while it was unjust  then i seized it  and to me is the return . section 7  opposition to the prophet 49 say  o people  i am only a plain warner to you . 50 so those who believe and do good  for them is forgiveness and an honour able sustenance . 51 and those who strive to oppose our messages  they are the inmates of the flaming fire . 52 and we never sent a messenger or a prophet before you but when he desired  the devil made a suggestion in regard to his desire  but allah annuls what the devil casts  then does allah estab lish his messages . and allah is knowing  wise â€ ” 53 that he may make what the devil casts a trial for those in whose hearts is a disease and the hardhearted . c and surely the wrongdoers are in severe opposition  54 and that those who have been given know ledge may know that it is the truth from your lord  so they should believe in it that their hearts may be lowly before him . and surely allah is the guide of those who believe  into a right path . 55 and those who disbelieve will not cease to be in doubt concerning it  until the hour overtakes them suddenly  or the a  47  those spoken of here are undoubtedly the opponents of truth who were to come later  and who have been allowed to oppose the advance of islam for a thousand years . the setback which islam was to receive for a thousand years is again spoken of in 325. b  52  a false story is mentioned in connection with this verse  according to which the holy prophet on one occasion recognized that the idols worshipped by the arabs could intercede with god on their behalf . see 5321 footnote . this story has been rejected by all sound and reliable commentators . the words of this verse do not  and can not  mean that when a prophet recites a revelation  the devil intro duces his own words into his recitation . what every prophet desires is the estab lishing of the truth that is revealed to him  and it is with this desire of every prophet that the devil interferes  instigating people  making suggestions to them  as stated here  to oppose the truth . that this is the true meaning is also shown by the context  which deals with the establishing of the truth and the desire of the opponents of truth to annihilate it . c  53  the devil s strivings against the prophet become a trial for the weak  who are unable to endure the severe persecutions of their enemies . 420 22 . the pilgrimage â€¢ 22  56 punishment of a destructive day comes to them . 56 the kingdom on that day is allah s . he will judge between them . so those who believe and do good will be in gardens of bliss . 57 and those who disbelieve and reject our messages  for them is a humiliating punishment . section 8  the faithful shall be established 58 and those who flee in allah s way and are then slain or die  allah will certainly grant them a goodly sustenance .  and surely allah is the best of providers . 59 he will certainly make them enter a place which they are pleased with . and surely allah is knowing  forbearing . 60 that  is so  . and whoever retaliates with the like of what he is afflicted with  and he is oppressed  allah will certainly help him . surely allah is pardoning  forgiving . 61 that is because allah makes the night to pass into the day and makes the day to pass into the night  and because allah is hearing  seeing 62 that is because allah is the truth  and what they call upon besides him â€ ” that is the falsehood  and because allah â€ ” he is the high  the great . 63 do you not see that allah sends down water from the cloud  then the earth becomes green  surely allah is knower of a  58  a flight of the faithful to abyssinia had already taken place  and on the occasion of the flight to madinah the holy prophet  with abu bakr and ali  were the last men to depart from makkah . a true and generous leader of men  he waited to see his faithful followers depart before he left  so that their safety might be ensured . if he had left his followers behind him  they would have encountered a very hard fate at the hands of an exasperated enemy . the reference to some being slain after their flight is clearly prophetical . b  60  this verse permits muslims  who were long persecuted and oppressed  to punish their persecutors  but at the same time recommends pardon and forgive ness by referring to those two attributes of the divine being in the concluding words of the verse . c  61  apparently the succession of the day and the night refers here to the turn of fortune hinted at in the previous verse  because an oppressed community could not punish its persecutors unless it gained mastery over them . the same is indicated in the two attributes of the divine being with which the verse is closed . the verses that follow contain hints to the same effect . 22  64 â€¢ divine mercy in dealing with people 421 subtleties  aware . 64 to him belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is in the earth . and surely allah â€ ” he is the self sufficient  the praised . section 9  divine mercy in dealing with people 65 do you not see that allah has made subservient to you all that is in the earth  and the ships gliding in the sea by his command  and he withholds the heaven from falling on the earth except with his permission . surely allah is compassionate  merci ful to mankind .  66 and he it is who brings you to life  then he causes you to die  then he will bring you to life . surely man is ungrateful . 67 to every nation we appointed acts of devotion  which they observe   so do not let them dispute with you in the matter  and call  them  to jour lord . surely you are on a right guidance . 68 and if they argue with you  say  allah best knows what you do . 69 allah will judge between you on the day of resurrection in that in which you differ . 70 do you not know that allah knows what is in the heaven and the earth  surely this is in a book . that is surely easy to allah . 71 and they serve besides allah that for which he has not sent any authority  and of which they have no knowledge . and for the unjust there is no helper . 72 and when our clear messages are recited to them  you will notice a denial on the faces of those who disbelieve â€ ” they almost attack those who recite to them our messages . say  shall i inform you of what is worse than this  the fire . allah has promised it to those who disbelieve . and evil is the destination . a  65  the first part of the verse gives a promise of victory to the muslims  while the latter part warns the opponents that allah withholds the punishment from them for a time  for he is compassionate and merciful to people . the withholding of the heaven means the withholding of the punishment  which the opponents were told would come down upon them from heaven . b  67  the principle that all nations were given spiritual light is reiterated throughout the quran . 422 22 . the pilgrimage â€¢ 22  73 section 10  polytheism will be uprooted 73 o people  a parable is set forth  so listen to it . surely those whom you call upon besides allah can not create a fly  though they should all gather for it . and if the fly carry off anything from them  they can not take it back from it . weak are  both  the invoker and the invoked .  74 they do not estimate allah with his due estima tion . surely allah is strong  mighty . 75 auah chooses messengers from angels and from mankind . surely allah is hearing  seeing . 76 he knows what is before them and what is behind them . and to allah are all affairs returned . 77 o you who believe  bow down and prostrate yourselves and serve your lord  and do good that you may succeed . 78 and strive hard for allah with due striving . he has chosen you and has not laid upon you any hardship in religion â€ ” the faith of your father abraham . he named you muslims before and in this   that the messenger may be a bearer of witness to you  and you may be bearers of witness to the people  c so keep up prayer and give the due charity and hold fast to allah . he is your protector  excellent the protector and excellent the helper  a  73  the verse  while truly describing the inability of false gods to create the lowest form of life or to exercise the least control over creation  contains a clear prophecy that the false deities will be removed from the sacred house  and that both the worshippers and the worshipped will be helpless . b  781  the reference in before is to the revelation of abraham  who prayed that from among his descendants there should arise a nation of muslims  2128   and in this to the quran . the root word of islam and muslim is salm or silm  both signifying peace  and a muslim is therefore one who leads a life of peace  peace with god  which means complete submission to his will  and peace with man  which means that he causes no injury to any person  as a saying of the holy prophet has it  bukhari  23  . c  782  compare 2143  where similar words are used . the significance is that the muslim community is destined to play the role of leader to the whole of humanity . chapter 23 aimuminun the belie vers this chapter is so named because it deals with the success of the believers . continuing the subjectmatter of the last chapter  it first asserts the success of the believers and then refers to similar success in case of the former prophets  whose history  it tells us  will be repeated in the holy prophet s case . it ends with a condemnation of polytheism by its own votaries and shows how the wicked will finally regret their evil deeds . this chapter was revealed in the late period at makkah .    section 1  success of the faithful in the name of allah  the beneficent  the merciful . 2  1 successful indeed are the believers  2 who are humble in their prayers  3 and who shun what is vain  4 and who act for the sake of purity  a 5 and who restrain their sexual passions â€ ” 6 except in the presence of their spouses or those whom their right hands possess  for such surely are not to be blamed  e 7 but whoever seeks to go a  4  the words lilzakat mean for the sake of purity or to attain purity . the word zakat means originally purity  as in 1913  while zakat in the sense of due charity is spoken of as being paid or given . b  5  this expression  lit . guard their private parts  means the restraining of sexual passions . c  6  the words ma malakat aimanuhum  literally  those whom their right hands possess   usually indicate slaves . it should be noted that this chapter was revealed at makkah  and the conditions under which slavegirls could be taken as wives were given later at madinah  see 425 . if the reference here is to sexual rela tions  the permission regarding those whom their right hands possess must be read subject to the conditions of 425 . it may  however  be added that the expression used in v. 5 means in a wider sense the covering of parts of the body which it is indecent to expose  and in this connection it must be borne in mind that  according to islamic rules of decency  the exposure of such parts of the body  as are generally exposed at evening entertainment venues  is disallowed  but a certain degree of freedom is allowed to women in the presence of their husbands and female servants and to men in the presence of their wives and male servants . 423 424 23 . the believers â€¢ 23  8 beyond that  these are the transgressors â€ ” 8 and those who are faithful to their trusts and their covenant  9 and those who keep a guard on their prayers . 10 these are the heirs  n who inherit para dise . in it they will abide . 12 and certainly we create man of an extract of clay  a 13 then we make him a small lifegerm in a firm restingplace  14 then we make the lifegerm a clot  then we make the clot a lump of flesh  then we make  in  the lump of flesh bones  then we clothe the bones with flesh  then we cause it to grow into another creation . so blessed be allah  the best of creators  15 then after that you certainly die . 16 then on the day of resurrection you will surely be raised up . 17 and indeed we have made above you seven ways â€ ” and never are we heedless of creation . c 18 and we send down water from the cloud according to a measure  then we cause it to settle in the earth  and we are indeed able to carry it away . 19 then with it we cause to grow gardens of palmtrees and grapes for you . you have therein many fruits  of which you eat  20 and a tree that grows out of mount sinai  which produces oil and relish for a  12  the creation of man is here traced back to earth  for the lifegerm in sperma is an extract of food  which is drawn from earth in whatever form it may be . while the first eleven verses speak of the spiritual growth of man  his physical growth is here spoken of  and thus a comparison may be established between the physical and the spiritual growth . though described in the past tense  it is a gene ral law of the creation of man that is spoken of here . the addition of the words  then we cause it to grow into another creation  v. 14   is to show that man s creation does not end with the completion of the different stages of physical growth  as in the case of other animals  but he is endowed with certain other faculties â€ ” the reference being to the moral and spiritual side of man s growth . b  14  the several stages in the growth of the human child  as given here  and unknown then  are quite in accordance with scientific investigation . it should be borne in mind that the word fa  meaning then  as used in then we clothe the bones ... does not always imply order . this is clear from the context  which states that there is first a lump of flesh  and the nucleus of the bones is generated in this flesh . c  17  instead of the seven heavens  here we have the seven ways  which may be the orbits of the seven members of the solar system  excluding the earth  as shown by the words above you . 23  21 â€¢ noah 425 the eaters .  21 and surely there is a lesson for you in the cattle . we make you to drink of what is in their bellies  and you have in them many advantages and of them you eat  22 and on them and on the ships you are borne . section 2  noah 23 and certainly we sent noah to his people  so he said  my people  serve allah  you have no god other than him . will you not guard against evil  24 but the chiefs of those who disbelieved from among his people said  he is only a mortal like you  who desires to have superiority over you . and if allah had pleased  he could have sent down angels . we have not heard of this among our forefathers . 25 he is only a madman  so bear with him for a time . 26 he said  my lord  help me against their calling me a liar . 27 so we revealed to him  make the ark under our eyes and according to our revelation  then when our command comes  and water gushes forth from the valley  take into it two of all things  a pair   and your own people  except those among them against whom the word has gone forth  and do not speak to me in respect of those who are unjust  surely they will be drowned . 28 then when you are firmly seated  you and those with you  in the ark  say  praise be to allah  who delivered us from the unjust people  29 and say  my lord  cause me to land a blessed landing and you are the best of those who bring to land . 30 surely there are signs in this  and surely we are ever trying  people  . 31 then we raised after them another generation . 32 so we sent among them a messenger from among them  saying  serve allah â€ ” you have no god other than him . will you not guard against evil  a  20  in the tree that grows out of mount sinai  and which produces oil  there seems to be reference to the blessed olive tree of 2435  as representing the muslim nation . b  27  see 1140  1142 . 426 23 . the believers â€¢ 23  33 section 3  prophets after noah 33 and the chiefs of his people who disbelieved and called the meeting of the hereafter a lie  and whom we had given plenty to enjoy in this world s life  said  he is only a mortal like you  eat ing what you eat and drinking what you drink .  34 and if you obey a mortal like yourselves  then surely you are losers . 35 does he promise you that  when you are dead and become dust and bones  you will then be brought forth  36 far  very far  is what you are promised  37 there is nothing but our life in this world  we die and we live and we shall not be raised again  38 he is only a man who has forged a lie about allah  and we are not going to believe in him . 39 he said  my lord  help me against their calling me a liar . 40 he said  in a little while they will certainly be repenting . 41 so the punishment overtook them in justice  and we made them as rubbish  so away with the unjust people  42 then we raised after them other generations . 43 no people can hasten on their doom  nor postpone it . 44 then we sent our messengers one after another . whenever its messenger came to a people  they called him a liar  so we made them follow one another and we made them stories . so away with a people who do not believe  45 then we sent moses and his brother aaron with our messages and a clear authority 46 to pharaoh and his chiefs  but they behaved haughtily and they were an insolent people . 47 so they a  33  the prophets are rejected because they are subject to the same laws of nature in their human requirements as other people . and no one can be a model for humans  who is not himself a human being  and who is not subject to the same laws of nature  for only a human being can show people how they can avoid fall ing a prey to the frailties of human nature . hence  a divine incarnation  or god in a human body  can not serve as a model to human beings . we want a mortal to show us how to avoid the pitfalls with which we  as mortals  are surrounded  if god himself comes into the world  he can not serve this purpose . b  44  the significance of making them stories is that the stories of their evil fate were the only remembrance of them left when they perished . 23  48 â€¢ higher values of life 427 said  shall we believe in two mortals like ourselves while their people serve us  48 so they rejected them and became of those who were destroyed . 49 and certainly we gave moses the book that they might go aright . 50 and we made the son of mary and his mother a sign  and we gave them refuge on a lofty ground having meadows and springs .  section 4  higher values of life 51 o messengers  eat of the good things and do good . surely i am knower of what you do . 52 and surely this your community is one community  and i am your lord  so keep your duty to me . 53 but they split apart their unity into sects  each faction rejoicing in what it had . 54 so leave them in their ignorance till a time . 55 do they think that by the wealth and children with which we aid them  56 we are hastening to them good things  rather  they do not perceive . 57 surely they who live in awe for fear of their lord  58 and those who believe in the messages of their lord  59 and those who set up no partner with their lord  60 and those who give what they give while their hearts are full of fear that to their lord they must return â€ ” 61 these hasten to good things and they are foremost in attaining them . a  50  this description of the land applies exactly to the valley of kashmir  and part of the lost ten tribes of israel is traced to kashmir  where a large number of places bear the names of places in palestine . there is also a tomb known as the tomb of nabi  i.e.  the prophet   or isa  i.e.  jesus   or a man by the name of yilz asaf  in srinagar  the capital of kashmir . the fact that the chapter deals with the final triumph of prophets and their deliverance from the hands of their enemies also gives us a clue to the mystery attending the circumstances of the disappearance of jesus after the event of the cross  for  as shown in 4157 footnote  jesus did not die on the cross . this verse indicates that  being delivered from the hands of his enemies  he was given shelter at some other place which  from its description here and other evidence  seems to be kashmir . traditions about yuz asaf lead us to identify him with jesus  and to conclude that jesus went to kashmir after the event of the crucifixion  and that he preached  lived  died and was buried there .  editor s note  since this footnote was written  much research has been published supporting this theory . for details  khwaja nazir ahmad s work  jesus in heaven on earth  first published in 1952  as well as a number of later publications  some of them by western authors  should be consulted .  428 23 . the believers â€¢ 23  62 62 and we do not impose on any soul a duty beyond its ability  and with us is a book which speaks the truth  and they are not wronged . 63 but their hearts are in ignorance about it  and they have besides this other deeds which they do . 64 until  when we seize those who lead easy lives among them with punishment  then they cry for help . 65 do not cry for help this day . surely you will not be helped by us . 66 my messages were indeed recited to you  but you used to turn back on your heels 67 haughtily  passing nights in talking nonsense about it . 68 do they not then ponder the word  or has there come to them something which did not come to their fathers of old  69 0r do they not recognize their messenger  that they deny him  70 or say they  there is madness in him  but he has brought them the truth  and most of them hate the truth . 71 and if the truth follow their desires  the heavens and the earth and all those who are in them would perish . indeed  we have brought them their reminder  but they turn away from their reminder . 72 0r do you ask them a recompense  but the recom pense of your lord is best  and he is the best of providers . 73 and surely you call them to a right way . 74 and surely those who do not believe in the hereafter are deviating from the way . 75 and if we show mercy to them and remove the distress they have  they would persist in their inordinacy  blindly wandering on . 76 and already we seized them with punish ment  but they were not submissive to their lord  nor did they humble themselves .  77 until  when we open for them a door of severe punishment  then they are in despair at it . section 5  polytheism is selfcondemned 78 and he it is who made for you the ears and the eyes and the hearts . little thanks you give  79 and he it is who multiplied a  76  the punishment referred to in this verse  and the distress  the removal of which is mentioned in the previous verse  probably refer to the famine which overtook the people of makkah . b  77  they do not take a warning from the milder punishment  so a severer punishment must follow . this overtook them in the form of battles  leading to their ultimate defeat . but the promise relates to the future as well . 23  80 â€¢ regrets of the wicked 429 you in the earth  and to him you will be gathered . 80 and he it is who gives life and causes death  and his is the alternation of the night and the day . do you not then understand  81 but they say the like of what the ancients said . 82 they say  when we die and be come dust and bones  shall we then be raised up  83 we are indeed promised this  and  so were  our fathers before . this is nothing but stories of the ancients  84 say  whose is the earth  and whoever is in it  if you know  85 they will say  allah s . say  will you not then be mindful  86 say  who is the lord of the seven heavens and the lord of the 87 mighty throne of power  they will say   this is  allah s . say  will you not then guard against evil  88 say  who is it in whose hand is the kingdom of all things and he protects  and none is protected against him  if you know  89 they will say   this is  allah s . say  from what are you then deceived    indeed  we have brought them the truth and surely they are liars . 91 auah has not taken to himself a son  nor is there with him any  other  god â€ ” in that case would each god have taken away what he created  and some of them would have overpowered others . glory be to allah above what they describe â€ ” 92 the knower of the unseen and the seen  so may he be exalted above what they set up as partners  with him   section 6  regrets of the wicked 93 say  my lord  if you show me what they are promised â€ ” 94 my lord  then do not place me with the unjust people . 95 and surely we are well able to show you what we promise them .  96 repel evil with what is best . we know better what they describe . a  95  the promise given to the holy prophet in these verses is that the power of his persecutors will be broken in his lifetime . b  96  the doing of good in return for evil is the common teaching of all prophets . but nowhere is the principle put in such a beautiful and practical form as in the quran . to return good for evil is only possible under certain circum stances  and the gospel doctrine â€ ” that ye resist not evil â€ ” has not been found practicable . the quran  however  says  repel evil with what is best . if you can repel an evil by doing good for it  it is the course recommended  but if punishment 430 23 . the believers â€¢ 23  97 97 and say  my lord  i seek refuge in you from the evil sugges tions of the devils   98 and i seek refuge in you  my lord  should they come to me .  until when death catches up with one of them  he says  my lord  send me back  100 that i may do good in that which i have left . by no means  it is only a word that he speaks . and before them is a barrier  until the day they are raised . c 101 so when the trumpet is blown  there will be no ties of relationship among them that day  nor will they ask of one another . 102 then those whose good deeds are heavy  those are the successful . 103 and those whose good deeds are light  those are they who have lost their souls  abiding in hell . 104 the fire will scorch their faces  and in it they will be in severe affliction . 105 were not my messages recited to you  but you used to reject them  106 they will say  our lord  our misfortune overcame us  and we were a people in error . 107 our lord  take us out of it  then if we return  to evil   we shall be unjust . 108 he will say  go away into it  and do not speak to me . 109 surely there was a group of my servants who said  our lord  we believe  so forgive us and have mercy on us  and you are the best of those who show mercy . 110 but you ridiculed them  until is necessary  that would be the better course . it is the only workable principle of life . a  97  the evil suggestions of the devils were really suggestions of the wicked  who were opposed to the progress of islam  and the prophet is here told to look upon allah as his only support . to seek refuge in the lord is the height of goodness . nowhere has a man a better refuge than in the source of all strength  and no mortal can aspire to a higher honour than having his refuge in the lord . the command to the prophet to say this is really an image of the aspiration of his soul . his soul rested in that highest degree of security from all evil suggestions  which is termed refuge in the lord . b  99  these words make it quite certain that the devils of the two previous verses are no other than the wicked opponents of the holy prophet . c  100  that the dead do not return to life is a principle which is reaffirmed here  see also 2195 . according to the quran there are three states of a man s life  viz.  his life in this world  his life in barzakh  referred to as  barrier  here  and the great manifestation of all spiritual realities that will take place on the day of resurrection . barzakh is the intermediate state in which the soul lives after death till the resurrection . here it is stated that no one who has passed into the state of barzakh is allowed to go back into the previous state . see further 3942 . 23111  regrets of the wicked 43 1 they made you forget remembrance of me  and you used to laugh at them . a m surely i have rewarded them this day because they were patient  that they are the achievers . 112 he will say  how many years did you remain in the earth  113 they will say  we remained a day or part of a day  but ask those who keep account . n4 he will say  you remained only a little â€ ” if only you knew  115 do you then think that we have created you in vain  and that you will not be returned to us  116 so exalted be allah  the true king  no god is there but he  the lord of the throne of grace . 117 and whoever invokes  besides allah  another god â€ ” he has no proof of this â€ ” his reckoning is only with his lord . surely the disbelievers will not be successful . 118 and say  my lord  forgive and have mercy  and you are the best of those who show mercy . a  110  it was not really the believers who caused them to forget the remembrance of their lord but  on account of their mocking the believers  the dis believers forgot their lord  hence the believers are here spoken of as though they caused the disbelievers to forget their lord . b  115  this verse establishes the doctrine of the responsibility of human actions . man is not created in vain  but he will be returned to his lord to meet the consequences of what he does in this life . chapter 24 ainar the light in verse 35 of this chapter islam is shown to be the most perfect manifesta tion of divine light to illumine both east and west  and hence the name of the chapter . as this light was to first illumine the houses in which muslims live  v. 36   this chapter deals with the purity of home life . it begins by condemning illicit sexual relations and slander against women  and then it prescribes measures to prevent sexual immorality . it goes on to deal with the kindling of divine light in muslim hearts and the establishment of the king dom of islam . it ends by teaching respect for each other s privacy and for the holy prophet s orders as these relate to the welfare of the community . this chapter was revealed at madinah  largely about 5 a.h . section 1  law relating to adultery in the name of allah  the beneficent  the merciful . 1  this is  a chapter we have revealed and made obligatory and in which we have revealed clear messages that you may be mindful . 2 the adulteress and the adulterer  flog each of them  with  a hundred strokes   and do not let pity for them detain you from a  2  chastity  as a virtue  is not given the first place in modern civilized society . the breach of the greatest trust which can be imposed in a man or a woman  the breach which ruins families  destroys household peace  and deprives innocent children of their loving mothers  is not looked upon even as seriously as the breach of trust of a small sum of money . hence the islamic law seems to be too severe to the west . the punishment for adultery is here stated to be flogging  not stoning to death  which was really prescribed by the jewish law . the cases of stoning to death for adultery by the prophet s orders relate actually to a jew and a jewess in one case  bukhari  2361   and others apparently occurred before the revelation of this chapter . that stoning to death was never contemplated by islam as a punish ment for adultery is made clear by 425  where it is stated expressly that the punishment for adultery in the case of slavegirls  when they are married  is half the punishment which is inflicted on free married women  and stoning to death could not be halved . besides  the quran nowhere speaks of stoning as a punish 432 24  3 â€¢ law relating to adultery 433 obedience to allah  if you believe in allah and the last day  and let a group of believers witness their punishment . 3 the adulterer can not have sexual relations with any but an adulteress or an idolatress  and the adulteress  none can have sexual relations with her but an adulterer or an idolater  and it is forbidden to believers .  4 and those who accuse free women and do not bring four witnesses  flog them  with  eighty strokes and never accept their evidence  and these are the transgressors â€ ” 5 except those who afterwards repent and act aright  surely allah is forgiving  merciful . 6 and those who accuse their wives and have no witnesses except themselves  c let one of them testify four times  bearing allah to witness  that he speaks the truth  7 and the fifth time  he shall swear  that the curse of allah be on him  if he is lying . 8 and it shall avert the punishment from her  if she testify four times  bearing allah to witness  that he is lying  9 and the fifth time  she shall swear  that the wrath of allah be on her  if he speaks the truth . 10 and if it were not for allah s grace upon you and his mercy â€ ” and that allah is oftreturning  to mercy  wise  ment for adultery . flogging was aimed more at disgracing the culprit than at torturing him . in the time of the prophet  and even for some time after him  there was no whip  and flogging was carried out by beating with a stick or with the hand or with shoes . the culprit was not stripped naked  but he was required to take off thick clothes . a  3  the idolater or the idolatress is mentioned along with the adulterer or the adulteress on account of the low standard of morality among the idolaters . b  4  this is an effectual restraint against slander and gossip  which so often bring disaster upon the heads of innocent women . unless there is the clearest evi dence of adultery against a woman  the slanderer is himself to be punished . c  6  the ordinance relates to the case of husbands who accuse their wives of adultery and have no evidence  see a case in bukhari  6830  . in such a case divorce is effected  the husband not being punishable for the accusation  though he can not produce witnesses  and the wife not being punishable for adultery  if she denies the charge in the manner stated . the same procedure would be adopted in a reverse case . d  9  editor s note  in this procedure  the testimony of the husband and of the wife are treated as of equal value and weight . 434 24 . the light â€¢ 24  1 1 section 2  slanderers of aishah 11 surely they who concocted the lie are a group from among you . a do not consider it an evil to you  rather  it is good for you . for every one of them is the sin he has earned  and as for him among them who took upon himself the main part of it  he shall have a grievous punishment . 12 why did not the believing men and the believing women  when you heard it  think well of their own people  and say  this is an evident falsehood  c 13 why did they not bring four witnesses of it  so  as they have not brought witnesses  they are liars in the sight of allah . d 14 and if it were not for allah s grace upon you and his mercy in this world and the hereafter  a grievous punishment would certainly have touched you for the talk you indulged in . a  111  the incident referred to here took place when the prophet  accom panied by his wife aishah  was returning from an expedition in 5 a.h. aishah had gone out on a private occasion  but  when she returned  she realized that she had lost her necklace  and went back to search for it . in her absence the attend ants  supposing her to be in her howdah  started while it was yet dark . when she returned  finding the camel and the men gone  she sat down there and was brought to madinah by a man who was in the rear of the party . some mischievous persons from among the hypocrites spread false reports  slandering her  and some of the muslims also associated themselves with the slander . aishah s innocence was at length established by this revelation  bukhari  5215  . those who had taken part in the accusation were punished  according to one hadith  ibn maja  2013  . it may be added here that the tongue of gossip has never spared even the most virtuous women . another case of a virtuous woman being thus defamed is that of mary  the mother of lesus  about whom the jews talked similar slander . the words â€ ” do not consider it an evil to you  rather  it is good for you â€ ” aim to bring solace to such aggrieved people . b  112  he who took the main part of it upon himself is said to be abdullah ibn ubayy  the chief of the hypocrites  bukhari  6436   because he concocted the lie and circulated the false report . c  12  there was not a single witness  nor any circumstance that could lend colour to the false story . d  13  while the quran takes a very serious view of crimes against chastity  it also makes criminal the circulation of false reports affecting a woman s chastity . thus even a lighter accusation in connection with the misconduct of women required the evidence of four witnesses  see 415 . 24  15 â€¢ slanderers of women 435 15 when you received it on your tongues and spoke with your mouths what you had no knowledge of  and you considered it trivial  while with allah it was serious . l6 and why did you not  when you heard it  say  it is not worthy of us to talk of it . glory be to you  this is a great slander . 17 allah instructs you never to return to anything like it again  if you are believers . 18 and allah makes clear to you the messages  and allah is knowing  wise . 19 those who love that scandal should circulate with regard to those who believe  for them is a grievous punishment in this world and the hereafter . and allah knows  while you do not know . 20 and if it were not for allah s grace on you and his mercy  â€ ” and that allah is compassionate  merciful . section 3  slanderers of women 21 o you who believe  do not follow the footsteps of the devil . and whoever follows the footsteps of the devil  surely he commands indecency and evil . and if it were not for allah s grace on you and his mercy  not one of you would ever have been pure  but allah purifies whom he pleases . and allah is hearing  knowing . 22 and the possessors of grace and abundance among you should not swear against giving to the near of kin and the poor and those who have fled in allah s way  and pardon and overlook . do you not love that allah should forgive you  and allah is forgiving  merciful . c a  20  the same words in the next verse are followed by the statement  not one of you would ever have been pure . b  21  this passage shows that the companions of the holy prophet were purified from sins by allah s grace . c  22  this verse was revealed in connection with the action of abu bakr  aishah s father  who had sworn not to allow maintenance to one of his relatives named mistah  who had taken part in spreading the false reports against aishah . after inflicting the legal punishment on the culprits the prophet was required to bear them no illwill and to hide no rancour in his heart even towards the slanderers of his wife . revelation even required his companions to be kind and forgiving to them . abu bakr is spoken of here as one possessing grace and abundance  bukhari  65.2413   the former of these words referring to his moral and spiritual superiority and the latter to abundance in wealth .  editor s note  upon hearing 436 24 . the light â€¢ 24  23 23 surely those who accuse chaste believing women  unaware  of the evil   are cursed in this world and the hereafter  and for them is a grievous punishment   24 on the day when their tongues and their hands and their feet bear witness against them as to what they did  25 on that day allah will pay back to them in full their just reward  and they will know that allah  he is the evident truth . 26 unclean things are for unclean ones and unclean ones are for unclean things  and good things are for good ones and good ones are for good things  these are free from what they say . for them is forgiveness and an honourable sustenance section 4  preventive measures 27 o you who believe  do not enter houses other than your own houses  until you have asked permission and greeted their inhabitants . this is better for you that you may be mindful 28 but if you find no one therein  do not enter them  until permission is given to you  and if it is said to you  go back  then go back  this is purer for you . and allah is knower of what you do . 29 it is no sin this revelation  abu bakr exclaimed   i certainly love that allah should forgive me   and then he resumed providing assistance to mistah . this verse shows also that it is entirely baseless and false to assert that islam prescribes the death penalty for those who commit  blasphemy  against its sacred personalities .  a  23  this refers to those who continue to spread evil reports concerning chaste women  the gossipmongers in every society . b  24  the evidence of the members of the body is sometimes witnessed in this very life against the doers of evil  in the consequences of the evil done . on the day of resurrection the consequences of the evil deeds will assume a palpable form  as is also indicated in the paying back in full of the just rewards in the next verse  and thus bear witness to the evil done . this highly developed idea of the resurrection did not exist before the quran . c  26  the meaning of this whole passage is made clear by the concluding words  i.e.  nothing impure can be attributed to the pure ones  and they are free from what the impure ones say . d  27  the law revealed in this verse lays down the basis of domestic peace and security needed for an advanced society . it is also a preventive measure against slander .  editor s note  this verse also supports the principle of having laws to safeguard the privacy of the individual within the home visavis the powers of the state authorities .  24  30 â€¢ preventive measures 437 for you to enter uninhabited houses in which you have your pro visions . and allah knows what you do openly and what you hide . 30 say to the believing men that they lower their gaze and restrain their sexual passions . that is purer for them . surely allah is aware of what they do .  31 and say to the believing women that they lower their gaze and restrain their sexual passions and do not display their adornment except what appears of it . and they should wear their headcoverings over their bosoms . c and they should not display their adornment except to their husbands or their fathers  or the fathers of their husbands  or their sons  or the sons of their husbands  or their brothers  or their brothers  sons  or their sisters  sons  or their women  or those whom their right hands a  30  men are told to lower their gaze  just as women are enjoined to do in the next verse . this injunction is given as a preventive against the evil of illicit sexual relations . the quran does not only forbid an evil  but also points out the way  by walking in which a person may be able to avoid it . both men and women are required to keep their eyes cast down  so that when they meet each other  neither should men stare at women nor women at men . in a society in which women never appeared in public  the injunction to men to lower their gaze would be meaningless  and the similar injunction to women given in the next verse  if they never left the compounds of their houses  would be absurd . b  311  to guard the relations between males and females and to check a too free intermingling of men and women  the quran requires women in particular not to display their adornment . but there is a clear exception here â€ ” except what appears of it or except that which it is customary and natural to uncover . what is prohibited is really the display of beauty  as elsewhere expressly indicated   and do not display  your beauty  like the displaying of the earlier  days of  ignorance   3333  . according to ibn jarir  the exception mentioned relates to the face and hands . as an argument corroborating this opinion he says that  when praying  the woman is not required to keep her face and hands covered â€ ” hands up to the elbow â€ ” while she is required to cover the rest of the body . according to hadith  the holy prophet himself is reported to have told asma  his wife aishah s sister  when she appeared before him in thin clothes  through which parts of her body could be seen  asma  when a woman attains her puberty it is not proper that any part of her body should be seen except this  and he pointed to his face and hands   abu dawud  3130  . this settles conclusively that islam never enjoined the veil or covering of the face . c  312  before islam women used to appear in public with their breasts partly uncovered . the khimar  pi . khumr  means a headcovering  and women were thus required to cover their breasts with a part of their headcovering . 438 24 . the light â€¢ 24  32 possess  or harmless male servants   or the children who do not know women s nakedness . and they should not strike their feet so that the adornment that they hide may be known . and turn to allah all  o believers  so that you may be successful . 32 and marry off those among you who are single  to spouses   and those who are fit among your male slaves and your female slaves . if they are needy  allah will make them free from want out of his grace . and allah is amplegiving  knowing .  33 and those who can not find a match must keep chaste  until allah makes them free from want out of his grace . e and those of a  313  by theiv women are indicated all women who come in contact with them  or women who are on the same social level with them . those whom their right hands possess include male and female slaves . next to them are mentioned servants  called here as tahiin or followers  because they follow the master   to which is added a qualifying phrase meaning  literally  not having need  of women  or lacking in cunning . these words mean male servants who take up service only as a means of living and not with the mischievous intention of getting intimacy in the house . it should be noted that women are nowhere forbidden to employ male servants or to appear before them . what this verse prevents is only display of female beauty except to those most nearly related to women  and this is a preven tive measure against the spread of loose ideas of morality  and a step to help restraint of sexual passions  which is all that the quran aims at . b  32  the quran looks upon the married state as the normal state  and hence it enjoins that  so far as is possible  those who are single should be married . it also requires both male and female slaves to be kept in a state of marriage . the keep ing of concubines is clearly inconsistent with this . islam is against celibacy  and considers parenthood to be the duty of every human being . the holy prophet  too  laid stress on muslim men and women living in a married state . thus he said   he who is able to marry should marry . for it keeps the gaze low and guards chastity  and he who can not should take to fasting  occasionally   for it will have a castra ting effect on him   bukhari  3010  . on another occasion he said  addressing some young men who talked of fasting in the daytime and keeping awake for prayer during the night  and keeping away from marriage   i keep fast and i break it  and i pray and i sleep  and i am married  so whoever inclines to any other way than my sunnah  he is not of me   bukhari  67  1  . c  331  the words translated as those who can not find a match may also mean those who can not find the means to marry . marriage thus becomes an obli gatory institution in islam  only those being excused who can not find a match or who lack the means to marry . marriage  in fact  affords the surest guarantee for the betterment of the moral tone of society . 24  34 â€¢ manifestation of divine light 439 your slaves who ask for a contract  to buy their freedom   give them the contract  if you know any good in them  and give them something out of the wealth of allah which he has given you . a and do not compel your slavegirls to prostitution when they desire to keep chaste  in order to seek the frail goods of this world s life . and whoever compels them  then surely after their compulsion allah is forgiving  merciful . 34 and certainly we have sent to you clear messages and a description of those who passed away before you  and advice for those who guard against evil . section 5  manifestation of divine light 35 allah is the light of the heavens and the earth . a likeness of his light is as a pillar on which is a lamp â€ ” the lamp is in a glass  the glass is as it were a brightly shining star â€ ” lit from a blessed olivetree  neither eastern nor western  whose oil gives light  even though fire does not touch it â€ ” light upon light . allah guides a  332  the word kitdb  or writing  as used here  stands for a contract between a slave and his master for the former to purchase his freedom . though the practice of the master making such a contract with the slave prevailed before the advent of islam  the important reform introduced by islam was that  when a slave desired such a contract to be made  the master could not refuse it . twelve centuries before any attempt was made by any individual or community to legis late for the liberty of slaves  a dweller in the arabian desert had laid down this noble institution  that  if a slave asked for a writing of freedom  he was not only to be given that writing by the master  but he was also to be provided with money to purchase his freedom  the only condition being if you know any good in them  i.e.  if he is fit for work and able to earn his livelihood . and  in addition  the duty was imposed upon the state of spending a part of the collection of the obligatory cha rity  zakdf  for this object  as stated in 960. b  35  allah is called here the light of the heavens and the earth because he has manifested hidden things and brought them into existence . mishkat means a niche  but it also has the meaning of pillar . in this parable  islam is represented as a likeness of the divine light  a light placed high on a pillar so as to illuminate the whole world  a light guarded by being placed in a glass  so that no puff of wind can put it out  a light so resplendent that the glass itself in which it is placed is as a brilliant star . it should be noted that the religion of islam is repeatedly spoken of as divine light in the quran   they desire to put out the light of allah with their mouths  but allah will allow nothing except the perfection of his light  though the disbelievers are averse   932  618  . hence it is of islam that the parable of 440 24 . the light â€¢ 24  36 to his light whom he pleases . and allah sets forth parables for mankind  and allah is knower of all things â€ ” 36  that light is  in houses which allah has permitted to be exalted and his name to be remembered within them . a therein do glorify him  in the mornings and the evenings  37 men whom neither merchandise nor selling diverts from the remembrance of allah and the keeping up of prayer and the giving of the due charity â€ ” they fear a day in which the hearts and the eyes will turn about  38 that allah may give them the best reward for what they did  and give them more out of his grace . and allah provides without measure for whom he pleases . 39 and those who disbelieve  their deeds are as a mirage in a desert  which the thirsty man thinks to be water  until  when he divine light speaks . the blessed olive  from which that light is lit  and which stands here for a symbol of islam  as the fig stands for a symbol of judaism  see 953   belongs neither to the east nor to the west . even so is islam  which must give light to both the east and the west  and which  therefore  does not specially belong to either of them . the reference seems to be to the welding together of the east and the west in islam  a prophecy which is now approaching its fulfilment in the awakening of the west to the truth of the principles of islam . the parable becomes clearer if light is taken to refer to the holy prophet . the prophet was by nature gifted with the highest qualifications . even before he received divine revelation  his life was a life of purity and devoted to the service of humanity . light emanated from him even before the light from on high came to him in the form of divine revelation  so that when revelation came to him it was light upon light . a  36  the divine light spoken of in the last verse is here stated as being met with in certain houses  the distinctive mark of those houses being that the name of allah is remembered in them  thus showing that these houses are the houses of muslims  and the light is therefore the light of islam . these houses  we are further told  though humble now  will be exalted . and the exaltation of the humble huts of the arab dwellers of the desert to royal palaces is a fact of history . b  37  in these houses allah is glorified in the morning and the evening  and therefore these can be the houses of no other than muslims  because the keeping up of prayer and the giving of the due charity is the distinguishing characteristic of islam . the opposition to his light  and the end of that opposition  are described in verses 3940 . the turning about of the hearts and the eyes means either that they will be transformed in the new life or that they will be in a state of commotion by reason of fear . the verse that follows lends support to the first meaning . 2440 manifestation of divine power 441 comes to it  he finds it to be nothing  and he finds allah with him  so he pays him his due . and allah is swift at reckoning â€ ” 40 or like darkness in the deep sea â€ ” a wave covers him  above which is another wave  above which is a cloud â€ ”  layers of  darkness one above another â€ ” when he holds out his hand  he is almost unable to see it . and to whom allah does not give light  he has no light .  section 6  manifestation of divine power 41 do you not see that allah is he whom do glorify all those who are in the heavens and the earth  and the birds with wings outspread  each one knows its prayer and its glorification . and allah is knower of what they do . 42 and allah s is the kingdom of the heavens and the earth  and to allah is the eventual coming . 43 do you not see that allah drives along the clouds  then gathers them together  then piles them up  so that you see the rain coming forth from their midst  and he sends down from the heaven  clouds like  mountains  in which is hail  afflicting with it whom he pleases and turning it away from whom he pleases . the flash of his lightning almost takes away the sight . 44 auah causes the night and the day to succeed one another . surely there is a lesson in this for those who have sight . 45 and allah has created every animal of water . so among them is that which crawls on its belly  and among them is that which walks on two feet  and among them is that which walks on four . c allah creates what he pleases . a  40  as the first part of the section gives a picture of the brilliant and dazz ling divine light given to the believers  the last part describes the utter darkness of doubt and ignorance in which the disbelievers are . their apparent hopes of success are compared with a mirage  and  when they are undeceived of these  they will find themselves in the presence of god and will have their dues paid to them . b  451  here only animals are spoken of as having been created from water  but in 2130 we are told that all life  whether animal or plant  has been created from water . c  452  the various kinds of animal life are here divided into three classes   1  the creeping things  the lowest and the first form in the development of animal life .  2  those walking upon two legs  such as birds  the second form of the development of animal life . man  though walking on two legs  is not included 442 24 . the light â€¢ 24  46 surely allah is powerful over all things . 46 we have indeed revealed clear messages . and allah guides whom he pleases to the right way . 47 and they say  we believe in allah and in the messenger and we obey  then some of them turn away after this  and they are not believers . 48 and when they are invited to allah and his messenger that he may judge between them  then some of them turn aside . 49 and if the right is on their side  they hasten to him in submission . 50 is there in their hearts a disease  or are they in doubt  or do they fear that allah and his messenger will deal with them unjustly  but they themselves are the wrongdoers . section 7  establishment of the kingdom of islam 51 the response of the believers  when they are invited to allah and his messenger that he may judge between them  is only that they say  we hear and we obey . and these it is that are successful . 52 and he who obeys allah and his messenger  and fears allah and keeps duty to him  these it is that are the achievers . 53 and they swear by allah with their strongest oaths that  if you command them  they would certainly go forth . say  do not swear  oaths   reasonable obedience  is desired  . surely allah is aware of what you do . 54 say  obey allah and obey the messenger . but if you turn away  he is responsible for the duty imposed on him  and you are responsible for the duty imposed on you . and if you obey him  you go aright . and the duty of the messenger is only to deliver the message clearly . 55 allah has promised to those of you who believe and do good that he will surely make them rulers in the earth as he made those before them rulers  and that he will surely establish for them their religion  which he has chosen for them  and that he will surely give them security in exchange after their fear . they will serve me  not setting up any partner with me . and whoever is in them  because human life is the highest form of the development of animal life  and it is generally mentioned as quite distinct from all animal life .  3  those which walk on four legs  and to this class belong most of the mammals . 24  56 â€¢ respect for privacy 443 ungrateful after this  they are the transgressors .  56 and keep up prayer and give the due charity and obey the messenger  so that mercy may be shown to you . 57 do not think that those who disbelieve will weaken  the truth  in the earth  and their abode is the fire . and it is indeed an evil destination  section 8  respect for privacy 58 o you who believe  let those whom your right hands possess and those of you who have not attained to puberty ask per mission of you three times  before the morning prayer  and when you put off your clothes for the heat of noon  and after the prayer of night . these are three times of privacy for you  besides these it a  55  this verse not only prophesies the establishment of the kingdom of islam  but also its permanence  so that successors will be raised to the holy prophet and the muslims made a ruling nation on earth . by those before them are meant in particular the followers of moses . islam at the time of the revelation of these verses was still surrounded by enemies on all sides  there was still fear for the believers  as the verse clearly shows  and idolworship still had the upper hand in arabia . the triumph of islam  which is prophesied in the parable of the divine light first  and the gradual advent of which is referred to afterwards  is here predicted in the clearest and most emphatic terms  the believers will be made rulers in the earth  their religion will be firmly established  security will be given to them in place of fear  divine unity will rule supreme . all these favours will be bestowed upon the muslims  for which they should be thankful  but  if they are ungrateful after that  they shall be dealt with as transgressors . the word kafara  to be  ungrateful   also means to disbelieve  and would mean here a denial in practice  or disobedience to divine commandments . there is also a reference here to the divine promise to raise reformers  sing . mujaddid  among the muslims  as prophets were raised among the israelites . such is the clear promise contained in a saying of the holy prophet   surely allah will raise up for this people  i.e.  the muslims  in the beginning of every century one who will revive for it its religion   abu dawud  361  . the promise given in the verse may therefore refer not only to the temporal successors of the holy prophet  but also to his spiritual successors or reformers . the analogy of the israelites  to which the verse refers  points to the appearance of a messiah among the muslims as a messiah was raised among the israelites  and it was on this verse that the claim of the late hazrat mirza ghulam ahmad of qadian  the founder of the ahmadiyya movement  was based . he claimed to be a reformer  mujaddid  for the fourteenth century of the hijra and the messiah whose advent among the muslims was foretold . 444 24 . the light â€¢ 24  59 is no sin for you nor for them   that  you go round about each other . thus does allah make clear to you the messages . and allah is knowing  wise . a 59 and when the children among you attain to puberty  they should seek permission as those before them sought permission . thus does allah make clear to you his messages . and allah is knowing  wise . 60 and  as for  women past childbearing  who do not hope for marriage  it is no sin for them if they put off their  outer  clothes without displaying their adornment . and if they are modest  it is better for them . and allah is hearing  knowing . 61 there is no blame on the blind man  nor any blame on the lame  nor blame on the sick  e nor on yourselves that you eat in your own houses  or your fathers  houses  or your mothers  houses  or your brothers  houses  or your sisters  houses  or your paternal uncles  houses  or your paternal aunts  houses  or your maternal uncles  houses  or your maternal aunts  houses  or  houses  of which you possess the keys  or your friends   houses  . it is no sin in you that you eat together or separately . so when you enter houses  greet your people with a salutation from allah  blessed  and  goodly . thus does allah make clear to you the messages that you may understand . a  58  rules relating to personal and family privacy are of the utmost impor tance in the betterment of social relations  and their nonobservance leads to all kinds of false reports  which scandalmongers are always ready to lay hold upon  thereby creating dissensions in society . b  60  the word used signifies a woman who has ceased to bear children and to have the menstrual discharge . the reference in putting off clothes is to the overgarment spoken of in 3359. c  61  the arabs had their scruples in eating with the blind  etc.  in which respect they were like the jews and some other people  including hindus . islam lays down a middle rule  and allows the individual a great latitude in this respect . a man may eat alone or with others  he may eat with the maimed  etc.  or he may eat in the houses of near relations and friends . the latter part of the verse shows that a certain degree of familiarity with near relatives is recommended  so that one can take food with them  even though he may not have been invited specially . 24  62 â€¢ matters of state to take precedence 445 section 9  matters of state to take precedence 62 only those are believers who believe in allah and his messenger  and when they are with him on an important matter  they do not go away until they have asked permission from him . surely they who ask permission from you  are they who believe in allah and his messenger  so when they ask permission from you for some affair of theirs  give permission to whom you will from among them  and ask forgiveness for them from allah . surely allah is forgiving  merciful . 63 do not make the messenger s calling among you as your calling of one another .  allah indeed knows those who steal away from among you  concealing themselves . so those who go against his order should beware that a trial may afflict them or there may befall them a painful punishment . 64 now surely allah s is whatever is in the heavens and the earth . he knows indeed your condition . and on the day when they are returned to him  he will inform them of what they did . and allah is knower of all things . a  63  it does not mean how the prophet is to be addressed  but in what manner his call is to be responded to . the context makes it clear . the previous verse states that none is to leave without the prophet s permission  when they are gathered together for some important matter requiring their presence  and the words that follow this passage are to the same effect . what is stated here is that the prophet s call to the believers is to be respected  and not to be treated as their calling of one another  because the prophet s call relates to some important affair affecting the welfare of the community  while their mutual calling of one another relates to their own private affairs . chapter 25 aifwqan the criterion the name of this chapter  alfurqan  meaning criterion  distinction or discri mination  is one of the names of the holy quran because of the distinction it brings about between truth and falsehood . it deals with the great transfor mation which the quran brought about in the lives of those who accepted it . at the outset it declares that the holy prophet s message is for all nations of the world . it goes on to assert the truth of the warning conveyed by the holy prophet and prophesies that a discrimination will be finally made between good and evil . it then draws lessons from the fate of previous peoples as well as from phenomena in nature . it ends with a description of the righteous  showing the transformation in people that the quran was to effect . this chapter was revealed entirely at makkah  most probably in the last period . section 1  a warner for all nations in the name of allah  the beneficent  the merciful . 1 blessed is he who sent down the criterion upon his servant that he might be a warner to the nations a â€ ” 2 he  whose is the kingdom of the heavens and the earth  and who did not take to himself a son  and who has no partner in the kingdom  and who created everything  then ordained for it a measure .  3 and they take besides him gods who create nothing  while they are them selves created  and they control for themselves no harm nor benefit  and they do not control death  nor life  nor raising to life . a  1  as this chapter deals with the mighty transformation which the quran had brought about in the lives of the people  it is mentioned here by the name furqan  criterion for distinguishing or discriminating between truth and false hood  . the words  he might be a warner to the nations  show that the transfor mation which was being brought about in arabia would ultimately extend over the whole world and all nations would benefit . b  2  verses 2 and 3 speak of the different kinds of polytheistic beliefs prevailing in the world  which were all destined to be swept away by the doctrine of divine unity as preached by islam . 446 254â « a warner for all nations 447 4 and those who disbelieve say  this is nothing but a lie  which he has forged  and other people have helped him at it . so indeed they have brought an injustice and a falsehood . 5 and they say  stories of the ancients  which he has got written  so they are read out to him morning and evening   6 say  he has revealed it  who knows the secret of the heavens and the earth . surely he is ever forgiving  merciful . 7 and they say  what a messenger is this  he eats food and goes about in the markets . why has not an angel been sent down to him to be a warner with him  c 8 or a treasure given to him  or a garden from which to eat  and the evildoers say  you follow a  5  in the previous verse  their allegation is that the quran is a forgery  here they allege that the prophet had caused some stories of the ancients to be written down by some people who helped him and it was these stories which were recited to him and which he gave out as a revelation from on high . how could mere stories bring about the transformation which the quran was working in the hearts of people  attention to this is drawn in the next verse . b  6  the secrets of the heavens and the earth which are known to god alone include the secrets of human nature . transformation in people s lives has always been brought about by means of divine revelation  and mortal efforts have ever failed in changing the hearts of people . c  7  the holy prophet s life was one of the utmost simplicity . he did all his work himself . he aided his wives in their household duties  mended his clothes  tied up the goats  and even cobbled his sandals . in fact  his kind and genial nature often led him to do others  work . once a woman  unable to work for herself  asked him to lead her into a certain street  he accompanied her there  only taking leave when her work was accomplished . he was a mortal  and partook of the ordi nary food of a simple arab . hence they speak of him as eating food . the answer to this is given in v. 20  viz.  that all prophets were mortal and subject to human laws  as was the holy prophet . d  8  their idea of a messenger of god was that he should be rolling in wealth . in fact  wealth was all in all to them and they paid no consideration to the moral  the higher  values of life for which the prophet came . they were at the same time told that  though the muslims had to suffer privations  they would be rewarded for their sacrifices in this very life . treasures were placed at the feet of the companions of the holy prophet  and they were given gardens . but all this happened in accordance with divine law  which requires the fulfilment of prophecy to be brought about gradually  even as it requires all growth to be gradual in the physical world . 448 25 . the criterion â€¢ 25  9 only a man bewitched  see what parables they set forth for you â€ ” they have gone astray  so they can not find a way . a section 2  truth of the warning 10 blessed is he who  if he please  will give you what is better than this  gardens in which rivers flow . and he will give you palaces . n but they deny the hour  and we have prepared a burning fire for him who denies the hour . 12 when it sees them from a faroff place  they will hear its raging and roaring . 13 and when they are cast into a narrow place in it  in chains  they will there pray for destruction . 14 do not pray this day for destruction once but pray for destruction again and again . 15 say  is this better or the garden of perpetuity  which the dutiful are promised  that is a reward and a destination for them . 16 they shall have in it what they desire  to abide . it is a promise to be prayed for from your lord . c 17 and on the day when he will gather them  and what they serve besides allah  he will say  was it you who led astray these my servants  or did they themselves stray from the path  18 they will say  glory be to you  it was not befitting for us to take for protectors others besides you  but you made them and their fathers to enjoy until they forgot the reminder  and they became a lost people .  19 so they will call you liars in what you say  then a  9  elsewhere  the disbelievers are quoted as saying   why was not this quran revealed to a man of importance in the two towns    4331  . nothing except rank or wealth had any importance in their eyes . their very conception of the real values of life was wrong  so they could not find a way . b  10  these words contain a clear prophecy that the prophet and his follow ers will receive the good things of this life too . the gardens of mesopotamia  the palaces of persia and of the caesars  were given to the companions of the holy prophet . c  16  the garden is promised to the faithful but they should pray to their lord for its bestowal  because prayer to god is the means by which it can be attained . d  18  the words it was not befitting for us to take for protectors others besides you show that those who worshipped god alone could not ask their followers to worship others than god . the reference is clearly to jesus christ . 0 85 25  20 â€¢ the day of discrimination 449 you can neither avert  punishment   nor  obtain  help . and whoever among you does wrong  we shall make him taste a great punishment . 20 and we did not send before you any messengers but they surely ate food and went about in the markets . and we make some of you a trial for others . will you bear patiently  and jour lord is ever seeing .  section 3  the day of discrimination 21 and those who do not look for meeting with us  say  why have not angels been sent down to us  or  why  do we not see our lord  indeed they are too proud of themselves and revolt in great revolt . 22 0n the day when they will see the angels  there will be no good news for the guilty  and they will say  let there be a strong barrier  e 23 and we shall turn to the work they have done  so we shall render it as scattered dust . 24 the owners of the garden will on that day be in a better abidingplace and a fairer restingplace . 25 and on the day when the heaven bursts apart with clouds  and the angels are sent down  as they are sent 26 the kingdom on that day rightly belongs to the a  20  this is an injunction to the muslims to bear the persecutions of their opponents patiently  for these trials will distinguish the bad from the good . the concluding words are a solace to them  your lord is ever seeing â€ ” he will punish the oppressors . b  21  the coming of the angels and the lord signifies the coming of the threatened punishment  and the next verse makes it clear  see 2210. c  22  the words  strong barrier  bear different interpretations according to whether they are taken to be spoken by the angels or by the guilty . in the former case  the meaning is that good news will be a forbidden thing to the guilty  which is equivalent to saying that they will be punished . in the latter case  the words are a kind of prayer for the coming of a barrier between them and their punishment . d  23  all the exertions of the quraish were brought to naught in the battle of badr  and all attempts to uproot truth are dealt with similarly . e  25  this description of the day of badr is also given in 81112  where the falling of rain is clearly mentioned  and on the same occasion is also mentioned the coming of the angels . the next verse shows that it will be a day of victory for 450 25 . the criterion â€¢ 25  27 beneficent  and it will be a hard day for the disbelievers . 27 and on the day when the wrongdoer will bite his hands  saying  if only i had taken a way with the messenger   28 woe is me  if only i had not taken such a one for a friend  29 certainly he led me astray from the reminder after it had come to me . and the devil ever deserts man . 30 and the messenger will say  my lord  surely my people treat this quran as a forsaken thing . 31 and thus have we made for every prophet an enemy from among the guilty  and sufficient is jour lord as a guide and a helper . 32 and those who disbelieve say  why has not the quran been revealed to him all at once  it is so that we may strengthen jour heart with it and we have arranged it well in arranging .  33 and they can not bring you a question  but we have brought you the truth and the best explanation 34 those who will be gathered to hell on their faces â€ ” they are in an evil plight and straying farther away from the path . the muslims  the believers in the beneficent  and a hard day for the disbelievers . in fact  the distress and hardship the quraish experienced in the battle of badr were not tasted by them in any of their subsequent encounters with the muslims . a  27  commentators have here mentioned the names of some people who fought with the prophet at badr . but the statement is general and the evildoer often regrets the evil he did  when he suffers the consequences of the evil done . b  32  the quran was revealed piecemeal so that  under the varying circum stances through which the prophet passed  the divine revelation might be a source of strength to his heart  and then  as it were  to refute any suggestion that the revelation might remain a disorderly collection of fragments revealed under different circumstances  it is added that the entire arrangement was also divinely accomplished . the arrangement of the quran  according to this verse  was a part of the divine scheme  brought about in the lifetime of the holy prophet . c  33  this verse lays down the basis of an important principle  namely  that the quran not only contains answers to all objections against it  but also adduces arguments of the truth of the assertions made . no other religious book of the world satisfies this requirement  which circumstance alone places the quran above all scriptures  and points to it as a unique revelation capable of satisfying the spiri tual requirements of all people in all times . 2535  lesson in the fate of former people 45 1 section 4  a lesson in the fate of former people 35 and certainly we gave moses the book and we appointed with him his brother aaron  an aider . 36 then we said  go  both of you  to the people who reject our messages . so we destroyed them with utter destruction . 37 and the people of noah  when they rejected the messengers  we drowned them  and made them a sign for people . and we have prepared a painful punishment for the wrongdoers â€ ” 38 and ad and thamud and the dwellers of rass and many generations in between .  39 and to each we gave examples and each did we destroy with utter destruction . 4 40 and indeed they pass by the town on which was rained an evil rain . e do they not see it  but they hope not to be raised again . 41 and when they see you  they take you only for a jest  is this he whom allah has raised to be a messenger  42 he had almost led us astray from our gods  if we had not adhered to them patiently  and they will know  when they see the punishment  who is more astray from the path . 43 have you seen him who takes his low desire for his god  d will you be a guardian over him  44 0r do you think that most of them hear or understand  they are only as the cattle  rather  they are farther astray from the path . section 5  a lesson from nature 45 do you not see how jour lord extends the shade  and if he pleased  he would have made it stationary . then we have a  38  according to some  rass was a country in which a part of the tribe of thamud resided  others say that rass is the name of a town in yamamah . b  39  the meaning is that every one of these generations was warned of its doom by citing examples of those who had previously perished  but  not heeding the warning  was destroyed . c  40  this town is sodom  which was situated on the way to syria . d  43  this verse shows how broad is the idea of shirk or polytheism accord ing to the quran . it is not simply worship of idols that is condemned  but blindly following one s desires is equally condemned . many people who consider them selves the servants of the one god really bow in submission before the greatest of their idols  i.e.  their desire . the monotheistic doctrine has here been brought to a perfection not to be met with elsewhere . 452 25 . the criterion â€¢ 25  46 made the sun an indication of it  46 then we take it to ourselves  taking little by little .  47 and he it is who made the night a cover ing for you  and sleep a rest  and he made the day to rise up again . 48 and he it is who sends the winds as good news before his mercy  and we send down pure water from the clouds  49 that we may give life with it to a dead land  and give it for drink to cattle and many people that we have created . 50 and certainly we repeat this to them that they may be mindful  but most people only consent to denying . 51 and if we pleased  we could raise a warner in every town . c 52 so do not obey the disbelievers  and strive against them a mighty striving with it . d a  46  this and the previous verse show that allah deals mercifully with his servants . he would not destroy them all at once . the sun of righteousness had risen  and there were clear indications that the shadows of darkness would disappear  but  as in physical nature  they would not disappear suddenly  but gradually  dimini shing little by little . b  49  the mercy of allah  which appears in the form of rain in physical nature  comes spiritually in the form of revelation . as the pure water from the clouds gives life to a dead land  so does the pure water of revelation from him raise the spiritually dead to life . c  51  the companions of the holy prophet no doubt had this in mind when they spread far and wide  taking his message and warning to every distant town . it should  however  be noted that the verse does not contradict the statement in 3524  and elsewhere  that a prophet was raised among every nation . the chapter opens with the statement that the prophet was a warner to all nations . the state ment made here shows that  if god had pleased  he would have raised a warner in every town  but the oneness of humanity  which was a grand object following upon the oneness of god  could not have thus been brought about . hence the verse that follows requires a hard striving on the part of the prophet and his follo wers for this grand achievement . d  52  this verse affords a clear proof of the significance of the word jihad  as used in the quran . every exertion to spread the truth is  according to this verse  a jihad  in fact  it is called the jihad kabir   mighty striving   or the great jihad . fighting in defence of religion received the name of jihad  because under the circumstances it became necessary for the truth to live and prosper  if fighting had not been permitted  truth would surely have been uprooted . the commen tators all accept this significance of the word here . it should be noted that the greatest jihad which a muslim can carry on is one by means of the quran  to 25  53 â€¢ a lesson from nature 453 53 and he it is who has made the two seas to flow freely  the one sweet  very sweet  and the other saltish  bitter . and between the two he has made a barrier and inviolable obstruction .  54 and he it is who has created man from water  then he has made for him bloodrelationship and marriagerelationship . and your lord is ever powerful . 55 and they serve besides allah that which can neither bene fit them  nor harm them . and the disbeliever is ever an aider against his lord . e 56 and we have not sent you but as a giver of good news and as a warner . 57 say  i ask of you no reward for it except that whoever wishes may take a way to his lord . 58 and rely on the everliving who does not die  and celebrate his praise . and sufficient is he as being aware of his servants  sins  59 who created the heavens and the earth and all that is between them in six periods  and he is established on the throne of power  the beneficent . so ask respecting him one aware . 60 and when it is said to them  be submissive to the beneficent  they say  and what is the beneficent  shall we be submissive to what you order us  and it adds to their aversion . which the personal pronoun it at the end of the verse unquestionably refers  because such jihad must be carried on by every muslim under all circumstances . a  53  apparently the reference is to the sweetwater rivers flowing on earth or underground and to the saltish seawater . but there is a deeper reference to the two lives which man leads on earth  a sweet life of faith and goodness  which brings satisfaction and peace to the mind  and a bitter life of faithlessness and wickedness  which ever increases the thirst for material gains and never brings satisfaction to the mind of man . both existed in the world side by side  and so they would continue . b  54  the passage seems to hint at the flight to madinah . the prophet was related to the makkans through his father  and to the madinans through his mother . as his bloodrelations had persecuted him and were bent upon killing him  he is now reminded of his relationship through marriage to another people . it was no doubt due to some such hint in the divine revelation that the prophet was searching  on the occasion of the pilgrimage  for adherents among the people of madinah . c  55  the disbeliever aided the cause of untruth  as against his lord  while the prophet aimed at establishing the truth in the world . d  59  the one aware is the prophet  who possessed true knowledge of god . 454 25 . the criterion â€¢ 25  61 section 6  the transformation brought about 61 blessed is he who made the stars in the heavens and made therein a sun and a moon giving light  62 and he it is who made the night and the day to follow each other  for him who desires to be mindful or desires to be thankful .  63 and the servants of the beneficent are they who walk on the earth in humility  and when the ignorant address them  they say  peace  64 and they who pass the night prostrating themselves before their lord and standing . 65 and they who say  our lord  avert from us the punishment of hell  surely its punishment is a lasting evil  66 it is surely an evil abode and restingplace  67 and they who  when they spend  are neither extravagant nor miserly  and the just mean is ever between these . 68 and they who do not call upon another god with allah  nor slay the soul which allah has forbidden  except in the cause of justice  nor commit a  62  the night is here spoken of as being the more opportune time for being mindful  i.e.  for prayers  and the day for being thankful  i.e.  for work and livelihood . b  63  from here to the end of the chapter is described the great transforma tion which the prophet had already brought about . the great qualities spoken of as being met with in the servants of the beneficent present a striking contrast with the evils which reigned supreme in arabia . they were an arrogant people  who trampled the rights of their fellowbeings under their feet  but the faithful now walked in humility and led lives of lowliness  in which they had the greatest regard for others  rights  v. 63  . in the days of ignorance they passed their nights in drunken orgies  but now they kept awake at night in devotion and were instead drunk with the love of god  v. 64  . in the days of ignorance they spent money extravagantly  when it was a question of pride  and they did not care for the poor dying of hunger  but now they spent every penny they could on others  v. 67  . formerly idols were worshipped in arabia  human blood was shed on the slightest pretext  sexrelations were loose to an extreme  but they had now become the torch bearers of divine unity  for whose sake they willingly suffered every privation  homicide was looked upon with abhorrence  the highest value was placed on the chastity of men and women  and righteousness was the one thing in which men and women vied with one another  v. 6871  . truth and faithfulness were the great qualities that ruled people s minds  in the new dispensation  and a life full of vigour and earnestness was seen in the place of ignorance  superstition and immorality  which were the chief features of preislamic arabia  v. 7274  . 25  69 â€¢ the transformation brought about 455 fornication  and he who does this shall meet a penalty of sin â€ ” 69 the punishment will be doubled to him on the day of resurrec tion  and he will abide in it in humiliation â€ ” 70 except him who repents and believes and does good deeds  for such allah changes their evil deeds to good ones .  and allah is ever forgiving  merci ful . 71 and whoever repents and does good  he surely turns to allah a  goodly  turning . 72 and they who witness no falsehood  and when they pass by what is vain  they pass by nobly . 73 and they who  when reminded of the messages of their lord  do not fall down at them deaf and blind . 74 and they who say  our lord  grant us in our wives and our offspring the joy of our eyes  and make us leaders for those who guard against evil . 75 these are rewarded with high places because they are patient  and are met there with greetings and salutation  76 abiding there â€ ” a goodly abode and resting place  77 say  my lord would not care for you  if it were not for your prayer . now indeed you have rejected  so the punishment will come . a  70  here we are plainly told that the transformation had already been wrought  the vices in which the people indulged formerly had been changed to good and righteous deeds  and those who found pleasure in evil deeds now found pleasure in the doing of good . it was the soulforce of the prophet that had wrought this miraculous transformation . b  72  they not only shunned falsehood but were now above everything that was vain or futile . c  75  apparently they were being expelled from their homes but they felt as if they were being rewarded with high places  because their outlook on life was now spiritual and not material . in addition to the greetings and salutations of the angels they were promised greetings and salutations in their new centre of activity  madinah  to which they were fleeing  because there a similar brotherhood of the righteous was now ready to receive these emigrants . d  77  the truth had finally been rejected by the makkans  so the disgrace and abasement which was promised for the opponents of truth was now awaiting them . the righteous were finally separated from the wicked  so the punishment must come . chapter 26 alshuara  the poets the title of this chapter is taken from a reference to poets in v. 224  where the allegation is refuted that the quran is the work of a poet . it opens by consol ing the holy prophet that he need not be anxious because of the rejection of his message by the people or despair of their reform . then the histories of several prophets are narrated  presenting the fate of their opponents as a war ning to the holy prophet s opponents  and finally the subject reverts to their objections against him . this chapter  and the two following it  belong to the middle period at makkah . section 1  the prophet is consoled in the name of allah  the beneficent  the merciful . 1 benignant  hearing  knowing god .  2 these are the verses of the book that makes manifest . 3 perhaps you will kill yourself with grief because they do not believe . c 4 if we please  we could send down on them a sign from heaven  so that their necks would a  1  this verse consists of the letters fa  sin and mim  which may stand for the names of god  lafif  meaning benignant  sami   meaning hearing  and alim  meaning knowing . i may  however  suggest another interpretation . these chapters speak in particular of the calling of moses at mount sinai  so fa sin may stand for tur sina   or mount sinai  and mim may stand for moses  attention is thus called in these letters to the revelation granted to moses at mount sinai  which bears testimony to the truth of the prophet . this is corroborated by the plain statement made in the last chapter of this group  that the disbelievers called the revelations of moses and muhammad two enchantments backing up each other  2848  . b  2  the quran makes manifest all that is needed for a right development of the human faculties  and it also makes manifest the whole truth . c  3  the prophet was informed by divine revelation of the doom of an evil generation  but instead of cursing it  he exerted himself heroically to save his people by bringing about a mighty transformation among them  a transformation for which he was so anxious that he is described here as almost killing himself with grief . 456 26  5 â€¢ the prophet is consoled 457 bend before it . a 5 and no new reminder from the beneficent comes to them but they turn away from it . they indeed reject  so the news will soon come to them of that at which they mock . 7 do they not see the earth  how many of every noble kind we cause to grow in it  8 surely in this is a sign  yet most of them do not believe . and surely your lord is the mighty  the merciful . â° section 2  moses is called and sent to pharaoh 10 and when jour lord called moses  saying  go to the wrong doing people â€ ”  the people of pharaoh . will they not guard against evil  12 he said  my lord  i fear that they will reject me . 13 and my heart is anxious  and my tongue is not eloquent  so send for aaron  too  . 14 and they have a crime against me  so i fear that they will kill me . 15 he said  by no means  so go both of you with our signs  surely we are with you  hearing . 16 then come to pharaoh  and say  we are bearers of a message of the lord of the worlds  17 send with us the children of israel . 18  pharaoh  said  did we not bring you up as a child among us  and you stayed  many  years of your life among us  19 andyou did  that  deed of yours which you did and you are ungrateful . a  4  such a sign was sent in the battle of badr and again in the conquest of makkah . in the former place their chiefs were laid low  and in the latter they accepted submission . b  6  it was the prophecies of their own defeat and of the predominance of islam at which they mocked . c  9  seven prophets in all are spoken of in this chapter  and it is related how the enemies of every one of them were exterminated in the final triumph of the truth . yet to give an indication of the fate of the prophet muhammad s opponents each prophet s mention is ended with the two attributes of the divine being men tioned here  the mighty  the merciful  the first of these indicating that truth will  even now  be made to overcome all opposition and the second that the dealing with the opponents of the prophet would be a merciful dealing . the prophet s opponents were defeated indeed but they were not destroyed and a reformed people rose again to power . d  14  the reference is to the killing of the egyptian  as mentioned in 2815 . it is stated here that the people of pharaoh charged moses with a crime  not that he was actually guilty . see v. 20 and 2815 . 458 26 . the poets â€¢ 26  20 20 he said  i did it then when i was in error .  21 so i fled from you when i feared you  then my lord granted me judgment and made me a messenger . 22 and is it a favour  of which you remind me  that you have enslaved the children of israel  23 pharaoh said  and what is the lord of the worlds  24 he said  the lord of the heavens and the earth and all that is between them  if you would be sure . 25  pharaoh  said to those around him  do you not hear  26 he said  your lord and the lord of your fathers of old . 27  pharaoh  said  surely your messenger  who is sent to you  is mad . 28 he said  the lord of the east and the west and all that is between them  if you have any sense . 29  pharaoh  said  if you take a god besides me  i will certainly put you in prison . e 30 he said  even if i show you something plain  31  pharaoh  said  show it  then  if you are truthful . 32 so he threw down his staff  and lo  it was an obvious snake  33 and he drew forth his hand  and lo  it appeared white to the onlookers . section 3  moses and the enchanters 34  pharaoh  said to the chiefs around him  surely this is a skilful enchanter  35 who desires to turn you out of your land with his enchantment . what is it then that you advise  36 they said  give him and his brother respite and send heralds into the cities 37 that they bring to you every skilful enchanter . 38 so the enchanters were gathered together for the appointment of a wellknown day  a  20  the circumstances in which moses  act of striking an egyptian with his fist led to the death of the egyptian are related in 2815 . there was no inten tion to kill the man  nor did moses use any weapon with which death could be caused . the words  i was in error   dall  indicate one perplexed  being unable to know what was incumbent on him . he used his fist against the oppressor  and death was simply accidental . b  22  the israelites were employed only in menial work by pharaoh and the egyptians  it is this subjection to hardship which is here called enslavement . c  29  the gods of the egyptians were innumerable . there were abstract gods  cosmic gods  human gods and animal gods . pharaoh s claim to divinity among a people who were willing to deify anything has  therefore  nothing strange about it . d  33  see 7108 and 2020  2022  and the footnotes there . 26  39 â€¢ moses and the enchanters 459 39 and it was said to the people  will you gather together  40 perhaps we may follow the enchanters  if they are triumphant . 41 so when the enchanters came  they said to pharaoh  will there be a reward for us  if we are triumphant  42 he said  yes  and surely you will then be among those who are nearest  to me  . 43 moses said to them  throw down what you are going to throw . 44 so they threw down their cords and their rods and said  by pharaoh s power we shall most surely be victorious . 45 then moses threw down his staff  and lo  it swallowed up their fabrication . 46 and the enchanters were thrown down prostrate â€ ” 47 they said  we believe in the lord of the worlds  48 the lord of moses and aaron . 49  pharaoh  said  you believe in him before i give you permission  surely he is the chief of you who taught you enchant ment  so you will soon come to know . certainly i will cut off your hands and your feet on opposite sides  and i will crucify you all . 50 they said  no harm  surely to our lord we return . 51 we hope that our lord will forgive us our wrongs because we are the first of the believers . section 4  moses is delivered and pharaoh drowned 52 and we revealed to moses  saying  travel by night with my servants â€ ” you will be pursued . 53 and pharaoh sent heralds into the cities  proclaiming   54 these are indeed a small band  55 and they have surely enraged us  56 and we are truly a vigilant multitude . 57 so we turned them out of gardens and springs  58 and treasures and goodly dwellings â€ ” 59 even so . and we gave them as a heritage to the children of israel.  60 then they pursued them at sunrise . 61 so when the two groups saw each other  the companions of moses cried out  surely we are overtaken . 62 he said  by no means  surely my lord is with a  59  the pronoun them refers to gardens and springs  etc.  in general  and not to the particular gardens  etc.  from which the egyptians were turned out . the heritage of gardens and treasures was given to the israelites in the land of canaan  the promised land flowing with milk and honey . 460 26 . the poets â€¢ 26  63 me â€ ” he will guide me . 63 then we revealed to moses  march on to the sea with jour staff .  so it parted  and each side was like a huge mound .  64 and there we brought the others near . 65 and we saved moses and those with him  all . 66 then we drowned the others . 67 surely there is a sign in this  yet most of them do not believe . 68 and surely jour lord is the mighty  the merciful . section 5  history of abraham 69 and recite to them the story of abraham . 70 when he said to his sire and his people  what do you worship  71 they said  we worship idols  so we shall remain devoted to them . 72 he said  do they hear you when you call  on them   73 or do they benefit or harm you  74 they said  but we found our fathers doing so . 75 he said  do you then see what you worship â€ ” 76 you and your ancient sires  77 surely they are an enemy to me  but not  so  the lord of the worlds  78 who created me  then he shows me the way  79 and who gives me to eat and to drink  80 and when i am sick  he heals me  81 and who will cause me to die  then give me life  82 and who  i hope  will forgive me my mistakes on the day of judgment 83 my lord  grant me wisdom  and join me with the righteous  84 and ordain for me a goodly mention in later genera tions  85 and make me from among the heirs of the garden of bliss  86 and forgive my sire  surely he is in error  87 and do not disgrace a  631  this expression is similar to the one occurring in 260   march on to the rock with your staff  . elsewhere the same idea is expressed by saying   strike for them a dry path in the sea  not fearing to be overtaken  nor being afraid   2077   see also 250. b  632  the sea had gone back  thus leaving a dry path  2077  for the israelites . the meaning may be that each wave  as it receded  was like a huge mound . c  82  the prophets  being always conscious of their weakness  seek allah s protection . expressions like this invariably indicate human weakness before divine perfection  and are not evidence of sinfulness . compare jesus  confession of weakness in a similar strain   why do you call me good  no one is good but one  that is  god   matthew  1917  . 26  88 â€¢ history of noah 461 me on the day when they are raised â€ ” 88 the day when wealth will not avail  nor sons  89 except him who comes to allah with a sound heart . 90 and the garden is brought near for the dutiful  91 and hell is made manifest to the deviators  fl 92 and it is said to them  where are those that you worshipped 93 besides allah  can they help you or help themselves  94 so they are hurled into it  they and the deviators  95 and the followers of the devil  all . 96 they will say  while they quarrel in it  97 by allah  we were certainly in manifest error  98 when we made you equal with the lord of the worlds .  and none but the guilty led us astray . 100 so we have no inter cessors  101 nor a true friend . 102 now  if only we could return once  we would be believers . 103 surely there is a sign in this  yet most of them do not believe . 104 and surely your lord is the mighty  the merciful . section 6  history of noah 105 the people of noah rejected the messengers . 106 when their brother noah said to them  will you not guard against evil  107 surely i am a faithful messenger to you  108 so keep your duty to allah and obey me . 109 and i ask of you no reward for it  my reward is only with the lord of the worlds . 110 so keep your duty to allah and obey me . m they said  shall we believe in you when the lowest  people  follow .you  112 he said  and what knowledge do i have of what they did  113 their reckoning is only with my lord  if you could perceive . 114 and i am not going to drive away the believers  115 i am only a plain warner . 116 they said  if you do not give up  noah  you will certainly be stoned to death . 117 he said  my lord  my people call me a liar . 118 so judge between me and them openly  and deliver me and the believers who are with me . 119 so we delivered him and those with a  91  the making manifest of hell shows that it already exists  but is hidden from the human eye  while on the day of resurrection it will be made plain . 462 26 . the poets â€¢ 26  120 him in the laden ark . 120 then we drowned the rest afterwards.  121 surely there is a sign in this  yet most of them do not believe . 122 and surely your lord is the mighty  the merciful . section 7  history of hud 123 ad rejected the messengers . 124 when their brother hud said to them  will you not guard against evil  125 surely i am a faithful messenger to you  126 so keep your duty to allah and obey me . 127 and i ask of you no reward for it  my reward is only with the lord of the worlds . 128 do you build on every height a monu ment  being vain  129 and you make fortresses that you may abide forever . 130 and when you seize  people   you seize as tyrants . 131 so keep your duty to allah and obey me . 132 and keep your duty to him who aids you with what you know â€ ” 133 he aids you with cattle and children 134 and gardens and fountains . 135 surely i fear for you the punishment of a grievous day . 136 they said  it is the same to us whether you admonish or do not admonish  137 this is only a fabrication of the ancients  138 and we will not be punished . 139 so they rejected him

messengers . 142 when their brother salih said to them  will you not guard against evil  143 surely i am a faithful messenger to you  144 so keep your duty to allah and obey me . 145 and i ask of you no reward for it  my reward is only a  120  wherever noah is mentioned  only such of his people are spoken of as having been drowned who rejected and persecuted him  see also 1142 foot note . b  128  the word ayat  literally a sign  is used here to indicate the lofty building that should acquire renown as a sign of greatness . these lofty buildings were  no doubt  used to terrorize others  as v. 130 shows that acts of cruelty and violence were committed by ad  while they considered themselves safe in their fortresses . 26  146 â€¢ history of salih 463 with the lord of the worlds . 146 will you be left secure in what is here  147 in gardens and fountains  148 and cornfields and palmtrees having fine flowerspikes  149 and you carve houses out of the mountains exultingly . 150 so keep your duty to allah and obey me . 151 and do not obey the bidding of the extravagant  152 who make mischief in the land and do not act rightly . 153 they said  fou are only a deluded person . 154 7ou are nothing but a mortal like ourselves â€ ” so bring a sign if you are truthful . 155 he said  this is a shecamel  she has her portion of water  and you have your portion of water at an appointed time . a 156 and do her no harm  or the punishment of a grievous day will befall you . 15t but they hamstrung her  then regretted  158 so the punishment befell them . surely there is a sign in this  yet most of them do not believe . 159 and surely jour lord is the mighty  the merciful . section 9  history of lot 160 the people of lot rejected the messengers . 161 when their brother lot said to them  will you not guard against evil  162 surely i am a faithful messenger to you  163 so keep your duty to allah and obey me . 164 and i ask of you no reward for it  my reward is only with the lord of the worlds . 165 do you come to the males from among the creation  166 and leave your wives whom your lord has created for you  indeed  you are a people exceeding limits . 167 they said  if you do not give up  lot  you will surely be a  155  see 773 for thamud . they are described in v. 149 as carving houses out of the mountains  and  as it appears from here and 5428  the springs of water seem to have been few  and access to these was probably specially guarded  so that they were open only at particular times . for the shecamel  see 773 . salih seems to have demanded that the shecamel should be allowed to drink at such times . see 5428  where it is stated that every share of the water will be attended by the shecamel  or that she will have access to water at all times when the others are allowed to drink . a similar demand as regards her pasture is contained in 1 1 64 in the words  leave her to pasture on allah s earth   followed by the same words as those following this demand for drink   and do her no harm  . 464 26 . the poets 26168 banished . 168 he said  surely i abhor what you do . 169 my lord  deliver me and my followers from what they do . 170 so we deli vered him and his followers all  171 except an old woman  among those who remained behind .  172 then we destroyed the others . 173 and we rained on them a rain  and evil was the rain on those who were warned . 174 surely there is a sign in this  yet most of them do not believe . 175 and surely jour lord is the mighty  the merciful . section 10  history of shuaib 176 the dwellers of the grove rejected the messengers 177 when shuaib said to them  will you not guard against evil  178 surely i am a faithful messenger to you  179 so keep your duty to allah and obey me . 180 and i ask of you no reward for it  my reward is only with the lord of the worlds . 181 give full measure and do not diminish . 182 and weigh with a true balance . 183 and do not wrong people of their dues  nor act corruptly in the earth  mak ing mischief . 184 and keep your duty to him who created you and the former generations . 185 they said  you are only a deluded person  186 and   ou are nothing but a mortal like ourselves  and we think you are a liar . 187 so cause a portion of the heaven to fall on us  if you are truth ful . 188 he said  my lord knows best what you do . e 189 but they rejected him  so the punishment of the day of covering befell them . surely it was the punishment of a grievous day   190 surely a  171  see 780 for lot . the old woman referred to here was lot s wife . b  173  see 784 . stones were rained on them as the result of a volcanic eruption . c  176  they are the same as the people of midian . d  187  a portion of the heaven signifies a punishment from heaven . e  188  the demand for the threatened punishment is always met with ex pressions signifying that the matter rests in the hands of allah . such statements are really equivalent to saying that the thing will certainly come to pass .   189  the day of punishment is called the day of covering because it covered them with punishment . 26  191 â€¢ prophet s opponents warned 465 there is a sign in this  yet most of them do not believe . 191 and surely your lord is the mighty  the merciful . section 1 1  prophet s opponents warned 192 and surely this is a revelation from the lord of the worlds . 193 the faithful spirit has brought it   194 on   our heart thatou may be a warner  195 in plain arabic language . 196 and surely the same is in the scriptures of the ancients . e 197 is it not a sign to them that the learned ones of the children of israel know it  198 and if we had revealed it to any of the foreigners  199 and he had read it to them  they would not have believed in it . 200 thus do we make it enter into the hearts of the guilty . 2 a  193  the faithful spirit  alruh alamin  is the angel gabriel  who brought the divine revelation to the holy prophet . the prophet himself was known in makkah as alamin or the faithful one before revelation came to him . b  194  the words on your heart indicate that the prophet s heart  being the receptacle of the mighty revelation  was truly responsive to the great truths con tained in it . the high morals and the broad humanitarian truths which the quran contains give us a true picture of the great mind . this is referred to in one of the earliest revelations   and surely you have sublime morals   684  . the pithy but most beautiful statement of aishah  the prophet s wife  remains unsurpassed in depicting the character of the holy prophet . when asked about it she replied  his character is the quran  meaning that all those wonderful pictures of moral subli mity drawn in the quran were pictures of the noble mind to which the quran was revealed . c  196  the prophecies relating to the advent of the prophet muhammad  as met with in the jewish and christian scriptures  are referred to very often in the quran . the statement made here is  however  more comprehensive  they are met with in all ancient scriptures . see 381  where a covenant is spoken of as being made through all the prophets of the world with regard to the prophet s advent . there is a reference in the next verse to the learned men of the children of israel in particular because the jews and the christians had long been in contact with the arabs . rf  199  because prophecy plainly showed that the arabs were to be the recipients of the revelation  see isaiah 4211   let the wilderness and its cities lift up their voice  the villages that kedar inhabits.  . in the old testament  kedar  the son of ishmael  stands for the arab nation . hence earlier prophecy required that the final revelation should be granted to an arab . e  200  the meaning is that the quran was made to enter into their hearts by 466 26 . the poets â€¢ 26  201 201 they will not believe in it till they see the painful punish ment  202 so it will come to them suddenly  while they do not per ceive  203 then they will say  shall we be given respite  204 do they still seek to hasten on our punishment  205 have you then considered  if we let them enjoy themselves for years  206 then what they are promised comes to them â€ ” 207 what they were made to enjoy will not avail them  208 and we destroyed no town but it had  its  warners â€ ” 209 to remind . and we are never unjust . 210 and the devils have not brought it . 211 and it is not befitting for them  nor have they the power to do  it  . 212 surely they are far removed from hearing it .  213 so do not call upon another god with allah or you would be among those punished . 214 and warn your nearest relations  215 and be gentle to the believers who follow you . 216 but if they disobey you  say  i am clear of what you do . 217 and rely on the mighty  the merciful  e 218 who sees you when you stand up  219 and reason of the convincing proof of its truth  but they rejected it  as the next verse shows . a  212  the argument here is similar to that advanced by jesus when he said   and if satan casts out satan  he is divided against himself   matthew  1226  . the evil one can not be the source of the quran  for the quran calls to righteous ness . see also verses 221223. b  214  when this verse was revealed  the holy prophet  standing on mount safa  invited every tribe by name  and when the representatives of all the tribes had gathered together â€ ” among them being also the quraish and that inveterate enemy of the holy prophet  abu lahab â€ ” the holy prophet thus addressed them   tell me  if i were to inform you that a great army in the valley lies in wait to make a raid upon you  would you believe me    yes   was the reply in one voice   for we have never found anything but truth emanating from your lips .   then   said the prophet   know that i am a warner to you of an approaching punishment .   may you perish   cried out the illtempered abu lahab   was it for this that you called us together    bukhari  65.262  . c  217  the prophet is here told to rely on the mighty  the merciful  the very words that are repeated at the end of almost every section of this chapter  thus showing that the fate of the opponents of former prophets was spoken of simply to warn his own opponents . the attribute of mightiness is used to indicate the power to punish the wicked  while mercy indicates the deliverance and triumph of the righteous  or a merciful dealing even with the opponents . 26  220 â€¢ prophet s opponents warned 467 your movements among those who prostrate themselves . 220 surely he is the hearing  the knowing . 221 shall i inform you upon whom the devils descend  222 they descend upon every lying  sinful one â€ ” 223 they give ear  and most of them are liars . 224 and the poets â€ ” the deviators follow them . 225 do you not see that they wander in every valley  226 and that they say that which they do not do  c 227 except those who believe and do good and remember allah much  and defend themselves after they are oppressed . and they who do wrong  will know to what final place of turning they will turn back . a  223  the subject of v. 212 is reverted to here . the opponents of the quran would not listen to what is said in the quran â€ ” they are far removed from hearing it  as stated in v. 212 â€ ” but they listen to what their leaders in evil say . b  225  that is  they pursue an aimless course  while the prophet has a set purpose before him  and it is to make people walk in the ways of righteousness . c  226  the first suggestion of the disbelievers was that the quran was the work of the devil . that being shown to be inconsistent with its very nature and with the righteousness it preached  they said that it was the work of a poet . as against this they are told that none of the characteristics of a poet s work are to be met with in the quran . the poet never leads his followers to a life of righteous ness  while the quran was bringing about a pure transformation in the lives of those who followed it . again  the poets say things which they do not practise  whereas the prophet was not only a preacher of righteousness  but also an exemplar who translated into practice what he taught in words . and the weightiest consideration of all is that the poets can not utter prophecies like those which are met with in the quran . it is to this that attention is called in the next verse . d  221  the passage gives a description of the true believers in general  a new statement being introduced with ilia  except   or it may refer particularly to the poets from among the believers . chapter 27 ainami the naml the title of this chapter is taken from the mention in v. 18 of a tribe known as the naml in the story of solomon and the queen of sheba . it begins by dealing with the histories of moses and solomon  indicating the likeness of their lives with that of the holy prophet . he was a lawgiver like moses and eventually ruler of a kingdom as solomon was  yet retained the simplicity of the life of moses . the chapter then refers to the prophets salih and lot whose opponents were destroyed and goes on to prophesy the triumph of the faithful and to indicate that in the holy prophet s case this triumph would be gene rally through the spiritual resurrection of his opponents rather than their destruction . this chapter belongs to the middle period at makkah . section 1  a reference to moses  history in the name of allah  the beneficent  the merciful . 1 benignant  hearing god  a these are the verses of the quran and the book that makes manifest  2 a guidance and good news for the believers  3 who keep up prayer and give the due charity  and they are sure of the hereafter . 4 those who do not believe in the hereafter  we make their deeds seem good to them  but they blindly wander on .  5 these are they for whom is an evil punish ment  and in the hereafter they are the greatest losers . 6 and you are surely made to receive the quran from the wise  the knowing . 7 when moses said to his family  surely i see a fire  i will bring you from it some news  or bring you a burning brand  so that you may warm yourselves . 8 so when he came to it  a voice issued  a  1  see 261 footnote  for explanation . the letters here are fa and sin . b  4  by their deeds are meant the deeds which they ought to perform . evil deeds are made to seem good to evildoers by the devil  643   while allah commends good deeds . elsewhere we have   but allah has endeared the faith to you and has made it attractive in your hearts  and he has made hateful to you disbelief and transgression and disobedience   497  . 468 279 a reference to moses  history 469 saying  blessed is he who is in search of fire and those around it . a and glory be to allah  the lord of the worlds  9 moses  surely i am allah  the mighty  the wise  10 and throw down your staff . so when he saw it in motion as if it were a snake  he turned back retreating and did not return . o moses  do not fear . surely the messengers do not fear in my presence â€ ” n nor he who does wrong  then does good instead after evil  surely i am forgiving  merciful  12 and put your hand into your bosom  it will come forth white without evil  among nine signs to pharaoh and his people . surely they are a transgressing people . 13 so when our clear signs came to them  they said  this is clear enchantment . 14 and they denied them unjustly and proudly  while their souls were convinced of them . see  then  what was the end of the mischiefmakers  section 2  history of solomon 15 and certainly we gave knowledge to david and solomon and they said  praise be to allah  who has made us excel many of his believing servants  16 and solomon was david s heir  and he a  8  the words man filnar   who is in search of fire   have been explained in several ways  the best being that in which the word fl  lit.  in  may be rendered as meaning after or in search of . according to another explanation  these words mean that which is in fire and the place where fire was seen by moses to be burning is meant . the addition of the words those for whatever is  around it is to show that the whole of this land was blessed  because so many prophets for the guidance of humanity were raised there . that the fire was not a physical fire is suggested by commentators . this is in fact clear . the voice that came to moses was the voice of god and it came in the manner in which the divine call comes to all prophets . moses received a divine revelation  and what he saw was during a state of transformation . b  11  the word ilia  with which this verse opens  does not here mean except but is equivalent to waw  and  . being joined to the  not  in the previous passage  the correct translation of ilia here is and not  i.e . nor . c  15  the history of david and solomon  being the history of the temporal greatness of the israelites  forms really a part of the history of moses  and reference to it is in fact prophetical  to show that islam was also destined to rise to greatness temporally as well as spiritually . 470 27 . the naml â€¢ 27  17 said  o people  we have been taught the speech of birds   and we have been granted all sorts of things . surely this is manifest grace . 17 and his forces of the jinn and the men and the birds were gathered to solomon  and they were formed into groups . 18 until when they came to the valley of the naml  c a namlite said  o naml  enter your houses   so that  solomon and his forces may not crush you  while they do not know . 19 so he smiled  wondering at her word  and said  my lord  grant me that i may be grateful for your favour which you have bestowed on me and on my parents  and that i may do good such as you are pleased with  and admit me  by your mercy  among your righteous servants . 20 and he reviewed the birds  then said  how is it i do not see hudhud  or is it that he is one of the absentees  21 i will certainly a  16  solomon s understanding the speech of birds may imply the use he made of birds in carrying messages from one place to another  these messages being metaphorically called the speech of birds . the reference here is to the great resources of solomon s kingdom in his victorious marches against near and distant enemies . note also that solomon says  we have been taught . this shows that his people also knew that speech . b  17  the jinn were men belonging to certain mountain tribes whom solo mon had subjugated  fair may mean either birds or horse  i.e.  cavalry  as this word is applied not only to birds but also to swift animals such as horses . c  18  many of the fables regarding solomon have been due to a misconcep tion of the word naml  taken as meaning ant  . it should be noted that wadilnaml can not be properly translated as the valley of the ants  for naml is a proper noun . according to the classical dictionary taj al urus  the valley of the naml is situated between jibrin and asqalan . and namlah is the name of a tribe which literally signifies the eggs of the ants . the name namlah used also to be given to a child in whose hands an ant was placed at its birth  because it was said such a child would be wise and intelligent . d  20  the opening words may mean either a review of birds or a review of horses  see v. 17 . by hudhud is not to be understood the lapwing  but a person of that name . in every language many of the proper names given to people will be found to be identical with the names of animals . the arab writers speak of a king of himyar as hudad  which is almost identical with hudhud mentioned in the quran . the bible speaks of a king of syria  named ben hadad  1 kings 1518  etc.  . the muntahalarab states that hudhad was the name of the father of balqis  the queen of sheba . the verses that follow show clearly that solomon was speaking of one of his own officers . the infliction of severe punishment on a 27  22 â€¢ history of solomon 471 punish him with a severe punishment  or kill him  unless he brings me a clear excuse . 22 and he did not remain away long  then said  i have encompassed something you do not have comprehensive knowledge of  and i have come to you from saba  with sure information a â€ ” 23 i found a woman ruling over them  and she has been given all sorts of things and she has a mighty throne . 24 i found her and her people adoring the sun instead of allah  and the devil has made their deeds seem good to them and turned them from the way  so they do not go aright â€ ” 25 so that they do not worship allah  who brings forth what is hidden in the heavens and the earth and knows what you hide and what you proclaim . 26 auah  there is no god but he  the lord of the mighty throne . 27 he said  we shall see whether you speak the truth or whether you are a liar . 28 take this letter of mine and hand it over to them  then turn from them and see what  answer  they return . 29 she said  chiefs  an honourable letter has been delivered to me . 30 it is from solomon  and it is in the name of allah  the beneficent  the merciful  31 proclaiming  do not exalt yourselves against me and come to me in submission . section 3  history of solomon 32 she said  chiefs  advise me in this affair of mine  i never decide an affair until you are in my presence . 33 they said  we are possessors of strength and possessors of mighty prowess . and the command is yours  so consider what you will command . 34 she said  surely the kings  when they enter a town  ruin it and make the noblest of its people low  and that is what they do . 35 and surely i am going to send them a present  and to see what  answer  the messengers bring back . small bird by such a mighty monarch  as solomon  and the exposition of the great religious doctrine of the unity of god by the lapwing  are quite incomprehensible . a  22  saba  is the same as the sheba of the bible . the story as given here is not met with in the bible  but it was known to jewish rabbis . the bible speaks of the coming of the queen of sheba to solomon with large presents to test him . see 1 kings 10 and 2 chron . 9 . and later on  it speaks of many strange women as solomon s wives  1 kings 1 1  . 472 27 . the naml â€¢ 27  36 36 so when  the envoy  came to solomon  he said  will you help me with wealth  but what allah has given me is better than what he has given you . indeed  you are exultant because of your present .  37 go back to them  so we shall certainly come to them with forces which they have no power to oppose  and we shall certainly expel them from there in disgrace  and they shall be humbled . 38 he said  chiefs  which of you can bring me her throne before they come to me in submission  39 0ne audacious among the jinn said  i will bring it to you before you rise up from your place  and surely i am strong  trustworthy for it . e 40 one having knowledge of the book said  i will bring it to you in the twinkling of an eye . then when he saw it settled beside him  e he said  this is of the grace of my lord  that he may try me whether i am a  36  why was solomon angry on receiving a present from the queen  later events  as narrated further on  show that the present sent to solomon was a throne which was decorated either with nude art or with idolatrous paintings  or was offensive in some other way . solomon s order in v. 38 to bring her throne to him shows clearly that by it was meant the throne which she had sent to him as a present  and his order in v. 41 to make alterations in this throne shows that the paintings on the throne were abhorrent to a true worshipper of god . b  38  as usual  the narrative here omits the return of the messengers to the queen  and her willingness to submit to solomon on receiving the threat mention ed in the last verse  and continues at the point where solomon makes preparations to receive her . by her throne is meant the throne which she had sent as a present . c  39  the rising up from the place does not signify his standing up from the sitting posture  but his marching away from the place where he was at the time . the reference to being trustyworfhy shows that the execution of the work required an honest worker . the audacious jinn is apparently one of the amalekites  who were men of large stature . rf  40l  by one having knowledge of the book is meant an israelite as against the amalekite referred to above . the literal meaning of the concluding words of the sentence is  before your gaze returns to you . it is the same as in the twinkling of an eye  the idea conveyed being that he could do it without delay . e  402  strange and curious legends are introduced by some commentators on the supposition that the events narrated took place in immediate succession . the words so when he saw it settled beside him do not indicate that he saw it settled in the course of the conversation given in the previous passage . it is an altogether different incident . 27  41 â€¢ history of solomon 473 grateful or ungrateful . and whoever is grateful  he is grateful only for the good of his own soul  and whoever is ungrateful  then surely my lord is selfsufficient  bountiful . 41 he said  alter her throne for her  we may see whether she follows the right way or is of those who do not go aright .  42 so when she came  it was said  was your throne like this  she said  it is as it were the same  and we were given the knowledge before about it  and we submitted . 43 and what she worshipped besides allah prevented her  for she was from a dis believing people . 44 it was said to her  enter the palace . but when she saw it she thought it was a great expanse of water  and prepared herself to meet the difficulty he said  surely it is a palace made smooth with glass . she said  my lord  surely i have wronged myself  and i submit with solomon to allah  the lord of the worlds a  41  as pointed out in v. 36 footnote  solomon was offended by the throne which the queen sent him as a present because of the indecent or idolatrous paint ings on it  and therefore before she came to him  he caused certain alterations to be made in the throne . the purpose of the alteration is given here in express words  whether she follows the right way . in fact  she seems to have invited solomon in the symbolic language of the paintings on the throne to her religion of idolatry  and by making alterations solomon indicated that he could not make a compromise with idolatry . b  42  by putting the question  was your throne like this  solomon wanted to draw her attention pointedly to the alterations made . the queen s answer shows that her envoy had already told her that solomon was offended by the present which she had sent â€ ” we were given the knowledge before about it . the sub mission referred to in the act of surrendering her kingdom does not mean that she had turned a muslim . this is made clear in v. 43  she was prevented from becom ing a true muslim owing to her worship of the sun . hence submission to god comes later  see the concluding words of v. 44. c  441  the use of the word saq  lit . shank or lower leg  to signify difficulty or distress in many phrases is a recognized idiomatic usage in arabic . the expres sion used here means that she prepared herself to meet the difficulty .  editor s note  the literal translation  she bared her legs  has been made the basis of many groundless  vulgar stories about this episode .  d  442  it appears that  in order to impress upon the queen that it was the unseen hand of god that worked in nature  solomon made water to flow under the smooth glass floor of his palace . thus he conveyed to her the message in symbolic 474 27 . the naml â€¢ 27  45 section 4  salih and lot 45 and certainly we sent to thamud their brother salih  saying  serve allah . then lo  they became two factions  contending . 46 he said  my people  why do you hasten on the evil before the good  why do you not ask forgiveness of allah so that mercy may be shown to you  47 they said  we consider you and those withjou an evil omen . he said   the cause of  your evil fortune is with allah  rather  you are a people who are tried . 48 and there were in the city nine persons who made mis chief in the land and did not act aright .  49 they said  swear to one another by allah that we shall attack him and his family by night  then we shall say to his heir  we did not witness the destruction of his family  and we are surely truthful . 50 and they planned a plan  and we planned a plan  while they did not perceive . 51 see  then  what was the end of their plan  that we destroyed them and their people  all  of them  . 52 so those are their houses fallen down because they did wrong . surely there is a sign in this for a people language that god was the real force behind all  as she had conveyed to him the message of idolatry in the symbolic language of the throne she had sent him as a present . the queen mistook the glass for the water which ran beneath  and when solomon drew her attention to it  she at once realized her own error in worship ping outward objects  like the sun  while the real force or the source of life was allah  whose hand worked in these objects . perhaps in words  too  he impressed on her the great message of divine unity . the result was that the queen accepted the religion of solomon â€ ”  submit with solomon to allah  the lord of the worlds . the quran here contradicts the bible which holds that solomon had gone over to idolworship on account of his nonisraelite wives  while the quran states that his wives were converts to his religion and believers in divine unity . a  48  there is no doubt a reference here to the enemies of the holy prophet  the chief of them being nine in number  eight of whom were slain at badr  except abu lahab who died at makkah on hearing the news of the defeat at badr . b  49  there seems to be a prophetical reference here to the plot against the holy prophet  for the same plan was ultimately agreed upon by the quraish to do away with him . one man from every tribe of the quraish was selected and  taking the prophet unawares  they were to thrust their swords into his body simul taneously so that no particular tribe could be held guilty . this was agreed upon immediately before the prophet s flight to madinah  and thus the incident as relating to salih is meant as a prophecy . 27  53 â€¢ the faithful will be exalted 475 who know . 53 and we delivered those who believed and kept their duty . 54 and lot  when he said to his people  do you commit foul deeds  while you see  55 will you come to men lustfully rather than women  indeed  you are a people who act ignorantly . 56 but the answer of his people was only that they said  drive out lot s followers from your town  surely they are a people who would keep pure  57 but we delivered him and his followers except his wife  we ordained her to be of those who remained behind . 58 and we rained on them a rain  and evil was the rain on those who had been warned .  section 5  the faithful will be exalted 59 say  praise be to allah and peace on

” all these wonderful signs of the existence of the great creator are here followed by another equally wonderful sign of the existence of god  the manifestation of his marvellous power in man . but mark the contrast . this mani festation of the existence of god is not to be sought in the greatness and power of man as the conqueror of the forces of nature  but in his weakness in his great o 476

they are in doubt about it . indeed  they are blind to it . a section 6  the spiritual resurrection 67 and those who disbelieve say  when we have become dust and our fathers  too   shall we really be brought forth  68 we have certainly been promised this â€ ” we and our fathers before  this is nothing but stories of the ancients  69 say  travel in the earth  then see what was the end of the guilty  70 and do not grieve for them  nor be distressed because of what they plan . 71 and they say  when will this promise come to pass  if you are truthful  72 say  maybe something of what you seek to hasten has drawn near to you . 73 and surely your lord is full of grace to people  but most of them do not give thanks . 74 and surely your lord knows what their hearts conceal and what they manifest . 75 and there is nothing hidden in the heaven and the earth but it is in a clear book . distress when  unable to find help from any source  he throws himself on the divine threshold and seeks help from god . but what is more  this manifestation of god s power is beautifully mingled with prophecy â€ ” and he will make you successors in the earth . the distressed ones here are no other than the muslims  who were being cruelly persecuted and tortured  and they are told that the mani festation of god s power in making them rulers of the earth would be as great as it was in his creation of the heavens and the earth . this also shows the purpose underlying the narration of the histories of david and solomon . a  66  human knowledge can not reach the life after death and god has given this knowledge to man through his revelation . but people are in doubt about it  in fact  they shut their eyes to it . 27  76 â€¢ passing away of opposition 477 76 surely this quran declares to the children of israel most of what they differ about . 77 and surely it is a guidance and a mercy for the believers . 78 trulyyour lord will judge between them by his judgment  and he is the mighty  the knowing . 79 so rely on allah . surely you are on the plain truth . 80 certainly you can not make the dead to hear  nor can you make the deaf to hear the call  when they turn back retreating . a 81 nor can you lead the blind out of their error . 7ou can make none to hear except those who believe in our messages  so they submit . 82 and when the word comes to pass against them  we shall bring forth for them a creature from the earth that will speak to them  because people did not believe in our messages .  section 7  passing away of opposition 83 and the day when we gather from every nation a company from among those who rejected our messages  then they will be formed into groups . 84 until  when they come  before him   he will say  did you reject my messages without comprehending them by knowledge  or what was it that you did  85 and the word will come to pass against them because they were unjust  so they will not speak . 86 do they not see that we have made the night that they may rest in it  and the day to give light  surely there are signs in this for a people who believe . 87 and the day when the trumpet is blown  then those in the a  80  this verse is a clear testimony to what is meant by the prophet s raising the dead  for here we are told that  if the dead turn back retreating  the prophet can not make them hear . evidently this verse and the opening words of the next speak of the reprobate who shut their eyes and close their ears to all truth . b  82  by the creature from the earth that will speak to them are evidently meant people who are bent low upon earth . these people are the materialistic nations of the west who have lost all sense of the higher values of life . the coming forth of this creature  the dabbat alard  is one of the signs of the approach of the hour according to the hadith . but the hour may mean either the day of judgment or the doom of a people  and this verse gives us an indication that the hour in this case stands for the doom of a nation  because here it is spoken of as being a punishment for not believing in the divine messages . 478 27 . the naml â€¢ 27  88 heavens and those in the earth will be struck with terror  except such as allah please . and all shall come to him humbled . a 88 and you see the mountains  you think them firmly fixed â€ ” they shall pass away as the passing away of the cloud  the handiwork of allah  who has made everything thoroughly . surely he is aware of what you do . 89 whoever brings good  he will have better than it  and they will be secure from terror that day . 90 and whoever brings evil  these will be thrown down on their faces into the fire . are you rewarded  anything  except for what you did  91 i am commanded only to serve the lord of this city  c who has made it sacred  and his are all things  and i am commanded to be of those who submit  92 and to recite the quran . so whoever goes aright  goes aright only for the good of his own soul  and whoever goes astray â€ ” say  i am only a warner . 93 and say  praise be to allah  he will show you his signs so that you shall recog nize them . andyour lord is not heedless of what you do . a  87  as a foretaste of what was in store for the rejectors of the truth  the prophecy was also brought to fulfilment in this life . the whole of arabia recog nized the holy prophet as its temporal and spiritual head  and the proud oppo nents were humbled . b  88  in the passing away of the mountains there is a clear reference to the removal of the mighty men who opposed the prophet s preaching . this is also shown by the concluding words of the verse  which clearly speak of the punish ment of the evil deeds by one who is aware of what they do . c  91  the statement here that the prophet is commanded to serve the lord of the city of makkah contains an allusion that the servant of the lord will be the lord of that city . d  93  note the firmness of the tone in which the showing of signs is asserted . chapter 28 aiqasas the narrative this chapter is chiefly a narrative of the story of moses . after relating events of the life of moses it announces that a prophet like him had now appeared with true revelation like the revelation of moses  and its opponents will be humbled . in the end it says that their great wealth will not make them successful and prophesies that the holy prophet will return to makkah in triumph . this chapter belongs to the middle period at makkah  although v. 85 would appear to have been revealed when the holy prophet was fleeing from makkah to madinah . section 1  history of moses â€ ” infancy in the name of allah  the beneficent  the merciful . 1 benignant  hearing  knowing god  a 2 these are the verses of the book that makes manifest . 3 we recite to you the story of moses and pharaoh with truth  for a people who believe . 4 surely pharaoh exalted himself in the land and made its people into parties  weakening one party from among them  he slaughtered their sons and let their women live . surely he was one of the mischiefmakers . 5 and we desired to bestow a favour upon those who were considered weak in the land  and to make them the leaders  and to make them the heirs  c 6 and to grant them power in the land  and to make pharaoh and haman and their forces see from them what they feared . a  1  see 26  1 footnote  for explanation . b  4  the two parties were the israelites and the egyptians  the latter being made the taskmasters of the former . this refers no doubt to the persecutions of the muslims . the quraish  the stronger party  wanted to crush the weaker party of the muslims . c  5  by making them heirs is not meant that they would be made heirs to pharaoh s possession  but heirs to a kingdom in the promised land of canaan . and this refers also to the establishment of the kingdom of islam and the defeat of its persecutors . d  6  haman seems to have been a minister of pharaoh . he is spoken of 479 480 28 . the narrative â€¢ 28  7 7 and we revealed to moses  mother  saying  suckle him  then when you fear for him  cast him into the river and do not fear  nor grieve  surely we shall bring him back to you and make him a messenger  of ours  . 8 so pharaoh s people took him up â€ ” he would be an enemy and a grief for them . surely pharaoh and haman and their forces were wrongdoers . 9 and pharaoh s wife said  a joy of the eyes to me and to you â€ ” do not kill him  maybe he will be useful to us  or we may take him for a son . and they did not perceive . 10 and the heart of moses  mother was free  from anxiety  . a she would almost have disclosed it  if we had not strengthened her heart  that she might be one of the believers . u and she said to his sister  follow him up . so she watched him from a distance  while they did not perceive . 12 and we did not allow him to be suckled before  so she said  shall i point out to you the people of a house who will bring him up for you  and they will wish him well  13 so we gave him back to his mother that she might be comforted  and not grieve  and that she might know that the promise of allah is true . but most of them do not know .  section 2  history of moses â€ ” flees egypt 14 and when he attained his maturity and became fullgrown  we granted him wisdom and knowledge . and thus do we reward those who do good  to others  . 15 and he went into the city at a time of carelessness on the part of its people  so he found in it two again in v. 8 and 38  and also in 2939 and 4024  36 . pharaoh and his counsellors feared that the israelites  who were aliens in the land of egypt  might one day become powerful and supreme in the land . hence they oppressed and persecuted them in various ways . yet the divine intention was to bring about what pharaoh feared . such also was the divine intention with regard to the persecuted muslims . a  10  her heart became free from anxiety on account of the assurance which she had received through divine revelation  the words that follow show that her heart had been strengthened with patience  so it can not be said to have become devoid  or free  of patience . b  13  the reference is clearly to the opponents of the holy prophet  who did not know that the promise of allah  as given to the faithful  would prove true . 28  16 â€¢ history of moses â€ ” flees egypt 481 men fighting â€ ” one being of his community and the other of his enemies  and he who was of his community cried out to him for help against him who was of his enemies  so moses struck him with his fist and killed him . he said  this is on account of the devil s doing  surely he is an enemy  openly leading astray .  16 he said  my lord  surely i have done harm to myself  so protect me  so he protected him . surely he is the forgiving  the merciful . 17 he said  my lord  because you have bestowed a favour on me  i shall never be a backer of the guilty . 18 and  the next day  he was in the city  fearing  awaiting  when suddenly  he who had asked his assistance the day before was crying out to him for help . moses said to him  you are surely clearly doing wrong . c 19 so when he desired to seize him who was an enemy to them both  he said  moses  do you intend to kill me as you killed a person yesterday  fou only desire to be a tyrant in the land  and you do not intend to be of those who act aright . 20 and a man came running from the remotest part of the city . he said  moses  the chiefs are consulting together to kill you  so depart  at once   surely i am one of your wellwishers . 21 so he went forth from it  fearing  awaiting . he said  my lord  deliver me from the unjust people . a  15  the word  this   in moses  statement  refers to the punishment which he had given to the egyptian  the meaning being that it was on account of his devilish deed that the egyptian had been so punished . the rabbinical explanation of exodus 212 is that the egyptian merited death  because he had forced an israelitish woman to commit adultery with him   jewish encyclopedia  vol . ix  p. 48  . the quran does not name the offence  but there is no doubt that it calls his offence a devilish deed . v. 17 shows clearly that moses did not consider himself as one who had done an unjust deed or helped a guilty person . see also 2614. b  16  moses  prayer is not evidence of his being guilty  for the word zulm used here indicates making to suffer harm  loss  detriment or failure  and this is the meaning of zulm adopted in 7160 and 1833 . the meaning here is that he had risked his own life in giving help to another . c  18  moses helped the man on the first occasion because he was oppressed  but now this very man was oppressing another . therefore he refused to help him . 482 28 . the narrative â€¢ 28  22 section 3  history of moses â€ ” in midian 22 and when he turned his face towards midian  he said  maybe my lord will guide me in the right path . 23 and when he came to the water of midian  he found there a group of men watering  and he found besides them two women keeping back  their flocks  . he said  what is the matter with you two  they said  we can not water until the shepherds take away  their sheep  from the water  and our father is a very old man . 24 so he watered  their sheep  for them  then went back to the shade  and said  my lord  i stand in need of whatever good you may send to me . 25 then one of the two women came to him walking bash fully . she said  my father invites you that he may reward you for having watered for us .  so when he came to him and related to him the story  he said  do not fear  you are secure from the unjust people . 26 0ne of them said  father  employ him  surely the best one you can employ is the strong  the faithful one . 27 he said  i desire to marry one of these two daughters of mine to you on condition that you serve me for eight years  but  if you complete ten  it will be of your own free will  and i do not wish to be hard on you . if allah please  you will find me  to be  one of the righteous .  a  25  the commentators say this man was shuaib  and shuaib is mentioned by the name of jethro in the bible . b  27  in moses  stay at midian for ten years  there is a prophetical reference to the ten years of the prophet s life at madinah . the mention of eight years has another underlying significance  for it was after eight years that the prophet came back to makkah as a conqueror  a clear reference to which is contained further on in v. 85  he who has made the quran binding on you will surely bring you back to the place of return . this occurred exactly eight years after his flight . that such is the real significance of relating this narrative is made clear in v. 45  where the prophet is thus addressed  and you were not dwelling among the people of midian  reciting to them our messages . it is  as it were  to say that it was moses who lived among the people of midian  but his episode really conveys the news of what will happen to you . it may be added here that moses was paid his wages  and the condition of his staying in midian for eight or ten years was as much in his own interest as in the interest of jethro  for as the bible narrative shows  pharaoh had died by the time that moses  stay in midian had come to an end . 28  28 â€¢ history of moses 483 28 he said  that is  agreed  between me and you  whichever of the two terms i fulfil  there will be no injustice to me  and allah is surety over what we say . section 4  history of moses â€ ” prophethood and mission 29 then when moses had completed
