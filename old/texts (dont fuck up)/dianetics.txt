.c. INTRODUCTION 


In nineteen thirty-two an investigation was undertaken to determine the dynamic principle 
of existence in a workable form which might lead to the resolution of some of the problems of 
mankind. A long research in ancient and modern philosophy culminated, in nineteen thirty-eight, 
in the heuristically discovered primary law. A work was written at that time which embraced man 
and his activities. In the following years further research was undertaken in order to prove or 
disprove the axioms so established. 

Certain experiences during the war made it necessary for the writer to resolve the work 
into applicable equations and an intensive program was begun in nineteen forty-five toward this 
end. 


A year later many techniques had been discovered or evolved and a nebulous form of the 
present work was formulated. Financed chiefly by a lump sum disability compensation, that form 
of Dianetics was intensively applied to volunteer subjects, and the work gradually developed to its 
present form. 

Dianetics has been under test by the writer, as here delineated, for the past three years. 
The last series of random volunteers, numbering twenty, were rehabilitated, twenty out of twenty, 
with an average number of work hours of 151.2 per subject. Dianetics offers the first anatomy of 
the human mind and techniques for handling the hitherto unknown reactive mind, which causes 
irrational and psychosomatic behavior. It has successfully removed any compulsions, 
repressions, neuroses and psychoses to which it has been applied.

.c. PRIMARY AXIOMS 


Dianetics is an heuristic science built upon axioms. Workability rather than Idealism has 
been consulted. The only claim made for these axioms is that by their use certain definite and 
predictable results can be obtained. 

The principal achievement of Dianetics lies in its organization. Almost any of its parts can 
be found somewhere in history, even when they were independently evolved by the writer. There 
are no principal sources, and where a practice or a principle is borrowed from some past school 
the connection is usually accidental and does not admit any further use or validity of that school. 
Dianetics will work, and can only be worked, when regarded and used as a unity. When diluted 
by broader applications of older practices, it will no longer produce results. To avoid confusion 
and prevent semantic difficulties, new and simplified terminology has been used and is used only 
as defined herein. 

Dianetics is actually a family of sciences. It is here addressed in the form of a science of 
thought applicable to psychosomatic ills and individual aberrations. 

The field of thought may be divided into two areas which have been classified as the 
“knowable” and the “unknowable.” We are here concerned only with the “knowable.” In the 
“unknowable” we place that data which we do not need to know in order to solve the problem of 
improving or resolving aberrations of the human mind. By thus splitting the broad field of 
thought, we need not now concern ourselves with such indefinites as spiritualism, deism, 
telepathy, clairvoyance, or, for instance, the human soul. 

Conceiving this split as a line drawn through the area, we can assign a dynamic principle 
of existence to all that data remaining in the “knowable” field. 

After exhaustive research one word was selected as embracing the finite universe as a 
dynamic principle of existence. This word can be used as a guide or a measuring stick and by it 
can be evaluated much information. It is therefore our first and our controlling axiom. 

The first axiom is: 

SURVIVE! 

This can be seen to be the lowest common denominator of the finite universe. It embraces 
all forms of energy. It further delineates the purpose of that energy so far as it is now viewable by 
us in the “knowable” field. The activity of the finite universe can easily be seen to obey this axiom 
as though it were a command. All works and energies can be considered to be 

motivated by it. The various kingdoms have this as their lowest common denominator, 
for animals, vegetables and minerals are all striving for survival. We do not know to what end we 
are surviving, and in our field of the “knowable” and in our choice of only the workable axioms, 
we do not know and have no immediate reason to ask why. 

All forms of energy are then surviving to some unknown end, for some unknown 
purpose. We need only to know that they are surviving and that, as units or species, they must 
survive. 


By derivation from the first workable axiom, we come into possession of the second. In 
obedience to the command “survive,” life took on the form of a cell which, joining with other 
cells, formed a colony. The cell, by procreating, expanded the colony. The colony, by 


2 



procreation, formed other colonies. Colonies of different types united and necessity, mutation and 
natural selection brought about specializing which increased the complexity of the colonies until 
they became an aggregation. The problems of the colonial aggregation were those of food, 
protection and procreation. In various ways a colonial aggregation of cells became a standardized 
unity and any advanced colonial aggregation came into possession by necessity, mutation and 
natural selection of a central control system . 

The purpose of the colonial aggregation was to survive. To do this it had to have food, 
means of defense, protection and means of procreation. The control center which had developed 
had as its primary command, Survive! Its prime purpose was the food, defense, protection and 
means of procreation. 

Thus can be stated the second workable axiom: 

THE PURPOSE OF THE MIND IS TO SOLVE PROBLEMS RELATING TO 
SURVIVAL. 

The ultimate success of the organism, its species or life would be, at its unimaginable 
extreme, immortality. The final failure in obedience to the law survive would be death. Between 
eternal survival and death lie innumerable gradations. In the middle ground of such a scale would 
be mere existence without hope of much success and without fear of failure. Below this point 
would lie, step by step, innumerable small errors, accidents, losses, each one of which would 
tend to abbreviate the chances of reaching the ultimate goal. Above this point would lie the small 
successes, appreciations, and triumphs which would tend to secure the desirable goal. 

As an axiom, the mind can then be said to act in obedience to a central basic command, 
survive, and to direct or manage the organism in its efforts to accomplish the ultimate goal for the 
individual or species or life, and to avoid for the individual or species or life any part of the final 
failure, which leads to the stated axiom: 

THE MIND DIRECTS THE ORGANISM, THE SPECIES, ITS SYMBIOTES OR LIFE 
IN THE EFFORT OF SURVIVAL. 

A study of the field of evolution will indicate that survival has been, will be, and is the 
sole test of an organism, whether the organism is treated in the form of daily activity or the life of 
the species. No action of the organism will be found to lie without the field of survival, for the 
organism is acting within its environment upon information received or recorded, and error or 
failure does not alter the fact that its basic impulse was motivated by survival. 

Another axiom may then be formulated as follows: 

THE MIND AS THE CENTRAL DIRECTION SYSTEM OF THE BODY, POSES, 
PERCEIVES AND RESOLVES PR OBLEMS OF SURVIVAL AND DIRECTS OR FAILS TO 
DIRECT THEIR EXECUTION. 

As there are many organisms in the same species, all attempting to accomplish the same 
end, and as there are many species, and as matter itself is attempting in one unit form or another to 
survive, there is necessarily conflict and contest amongst the individuals of the species, species, 
or units of matter. Species cannot survive without being interested primarily in the species. 
Natural selection and other causes have established this as a primary rule for survival: That the 
unit remain alive as long as possible as a unit and, by association and procreation, that the species 
remain alive as a species. Second grade interest is paid by the unit or the species to its symbiotes. 
Third grade interest is paid to inanimate matter. As this is apparently the most workable solution, 


3 



natural selection best preserves those species which follow this working rule. And the symbiotes 
of the successful species therefore have enhanced opportunity for survival. 


Man is the most successful organism currently in existence, at least on this planet. Man is 
currently winning in the perpetual cosmic election which possibly may select the thinker of the 
new THOUGHT. 

Man is heir to the experience and construction of his own ancestors. As cellular 
conservatism is one of the factors of survival, his brain is basically the same brain which directed 
and resolved the problems of his animal forebears. By evolution and natural selection, this brain 
therefore has the primary priority in emergencies. Superimposed on this animal brain has been 
developed an enormously complex analyzer, which probably exists in his frontal lobe. 

The command, survive, is variable in individuals and species to the extent that it may be 
strong or weak. Superior strength of the command in the individual or species is normally, but 
variably, a survival factor. The primary facet of personality is the basic strength of the DYNAMIC 
drive. 


The DYNAMIC is variable from individual to individual and race to race. It is varied by 
physiology, environment, and experience. Its manifestation in the animal brain affects the tenacity 
of the individual to life or purpose, and it affects the activity of the analyzer. The first 
characteristic of the individual which should be considered is the basic strength of his 
DYNAMIC. By this an axiom can be formulated: 

THE PERSISTENCY OF THE INDIVIDUAL IN LIFE IS DIRECTS Y GO KERNED 
B Y THE STRENGTH OF HIS BASIC DYNAMIC. 

The analytical, human or, as it has elsewhere been called erroneously, the conscious 
mind, is variable from individual to individual and race to race in its ability to perceive and resolve 
problems. Another axiom can then be formulated: 

INTELLIGENCE IS THE ABILITY OF AN INDIVIDUAL, GROUP, OR RACE TO 
RESOLVE PROBLEMS RELATING TO SURVIVAL. 

It should be noted that there is a distinct difference between the DYNAMIC and the 
intelligence. High intelligence may not denote high DYNAMIC. High DYNAMIC may not denote 
high intelligence. Intelligence is mental sensitivity and analytical ability. DYNAMIC is the 
persistency of the individual in obedience to the command, survive! 

It has been noted that there is a gradation in the scale of survival. Gains toward the 
ultimate goal are pleasurable. Failures toward the final defeat are sorrowful or painful. Pleasure is 
therefore the perception of wellbeing, or an advance toward the ultimate goal. Pain, therefore, is 
the perception of a reduction toward the final defeat. Both are necessary survival factors. 

For the purpose of Dianetics, good and evil must be defined. Those things which may be 
classified as good by an individual are only those things which aid himself, his family, his group, 
his race, mankind or life in its dynamic obedience to the command, modified by the observations 
of the individual, his family, his group, his race, or life. 

As evil may be classified those things which tend to limit the dynamic thrust of the 
individual, his family, his group, his race, or life in general in the dynamic drive, also limited by 
the observation, the observer and his ability to observe. 


4 



Good may be defined as constructive. Evil may be defined as destructive — definitions 
modified by viewpoint. The individual man is an organism attempting to survive in affinity or 
contest with other men, races, and the three kingdoms. His goal is survival for himself, his 
progeny, his group, his race, his symbiotes, life and the universe in general in contest with any 
efforts or entities which threaten or impede his efforts to attain the goal. 

His happiness depends upon making, consolidating, or contemplating gains toward his 

goal. 

It is a purpose of Dianetics to pass man across the abyss of irrational, solely reactive 
thought and enter him upon a new stage of constructive progression to the ultimate goal.

.c.AN ANALOGY OF THE MIND 


It is not the purpose of Dianetics to reconstruct the human mind. The purpose of 
Dianetics is to delete from the existing mind those physically painful experiences which have 
resulted in the aberration of the analytical mind, to resolve the physical manifestations of mental 
aberration, and to restore in its entirety the proper working function of a brain not otherwise 
physically deranged. Dianetics thus embraces the various aspects of psychosomatic conditions, 
including the glandular balance or imbalance of the organism, as influenced by painful physical 
experience. However, its purpose is not one of healing, and its address is not to such psycho- 
somatic manifestations specifically, but rather to those aberrative experiences in which these 
conditions have their roots. 

The initial adjustments of the individual are included in Child Dianetics and Educational 
Dianetics. Judicial Dianetics, Political Dianetics and Military Dianetics are elsewhere touched upon 
or allocated for study. Dianetics, as a family of sciences, proceeds however from the axioms 
cursorily touched upon in the last chapter and is uniformly governed by the principles of the 
behavior of the human mind. 

When an individual is acting contrary to survival of himself, his group, progeny, race, 
mankind, or life he can be considered to be unintelligent, uninformed or aberrated. Every single 
instance of aberrated conduct threatening the general goal of the individual as outlined in the last 
chapter can be proven to have a source which will specifically be found to be a painful experience 
containing data not available to the analytical mind. Every single instance and facet of aberrated 
conduct has its exact causation in the physically painful error which has been introduced during a 
moment of absence of the analytical power. 

Dianetics consists of discovering the aberration in the individual, finding the physically 
painful experience which corresponds to it and placing the data therein contained at the disposal of 
the analytical mind. More as an effort to demonstrate how that is accomplished than as an actual 
outline of the character of the mind, the following analogy is offered. 

First there is the physio-animal section of the brain, containing the motor controls, the 
sub-brains, and the physical nervous system in general, including the physical aspect of the 
analytical section of the brain. The control of all voluntary and involuntary muscles is contained in 
this section. It commands all body fluids, blood flow, respiration, glandular secretion, cellular 
construction, and the activity of various parts of the body. Experimentation has adequately 
demonstrated this. The physio-animal mind has specific methods of “thinking.” These are entirely 
reactive. Animal experimentation — rats, dogs, etc. — is experimentation on and with precisely this 
mind and little more. It is a fully conscious mind and should never be denoted by any term which 
denies it “consciousness” since there is no period in the life of the organism from conception to 
death when this mind is not awake, observing, and recording perceptics. This is the mind of a 
dog, cat, or rat and is also the basic mind of a man so far as its operating characteristics are 
concerned. A man in the deepest possible somnambulistic sleep is still in possession of more 
mind and thinking and coordinating ability than a lower animal. 

The term “consciousness” is no more than a designation of the awareness of now. The 
physio-animal mind never ceases to be aware of now and never ceases to record the successive 
instances of now which in their composite make up a time track connecting memory in an orderly 
chain. Cessation of life alone discontinues the recording of perceptions on this orderly track. 
Unconsciousness is a condition wherein the organism is discoordinated only in its analytical 
process and motor control direction. In the physio-animal section of the brain, a complete time 
track and a complete memory record of all perceptions for all moments of the organism’s 
existence is available. 


6 



As life progresses, for instance, from a blade of grass, greater and greater complexities 
and degrees of selfdeterminism are possible. Energy in its various forms is the primary motivator 
in the lower orders, but as the complexity of the order is increased into the animal kingdom, the 
physio-animal brain attains more and more command of the entire organism until it itself begins to 
possess the second section of the mind. 

All animals possess in some slight degree an analyzer. This, which we designate the 
analytical mind, is present even in lower orders, since it is only that section of the brain which 
possesses the self-deterministic coordinative command of the physio-animal brain and thus of the 
body. In a rat, for instance, it is no more than its “conscious” awareness of now applying to 
lessons of then without rationality but with instinct and painful experience. This is the analytical 
section of the mind in a lower animal but it is the reactive mind in a man whose analytical mind is 
so highly attuned and intricate that it can command entirely the physio-animal brain and thus the 
body. 


Man not only possesses a superior physio-animal mind but possesses as well an 
analytical mind of such power and complexity that it has no real rival in any other species. The 
analytical mind of man cannot be studied by observing the reactions of animals under any situa- 
tions. Not only is it more sensitive but it possesses factors and sensitivities not elsewhere found. 

Continuing this analogy: Lying between the analytical mind and the physio-animal mind 
may be conceived the reactive mind. This is the coordinated responses of the physio-animal mind, 
the “analytical” mind of animals, and the first post of emergency command in man. All errors of a 
psychic or psychosomatic nature can be considered for the purposes of this analogy to lie in the 
reactive mind. The first human analytical mind took command of the body and physio-animal 
mind under strained and dangerous circumstances when man was still in violent contest with other 
species around him. It can be considered that the analytical mind received command with the 
single proviso that instantaneous emergency would be handled by the outdated but faster reactive 
mind. 


Any and all errors in thinking and action derive from the reactive mind as it is increased in 
strength and power by painful experience. It can be called a shadow mind, instantaneously 
reactive when any of its content is perceived in the environment of the individual, at which time it 
urgently bypasses the analytical mind and causes immediate reaction in the physio-animal mind 
and in the body. Additionally, the reactive mind is in continual presence when chronically 
restimulated by a constantly present restimulator — which is to say, an approximation of the 
reactive mind’s content or some part thereof continually perceived in the environment of the orga- 
nism. The reactive mind is in action so long as it is activated by an exact or nearly exact 
approximation of its content. But given too continuous a restimulation, it can and does derange 
both the physio-animal mind and body below it and the analytical mind above it. It was created by 
deranging circumstances of a physical nature, hence it deranges. 

The entire content of the reactive mind is records of physical pain with its accompanying 
perceptions during disconnection of the analyzer. All aberrated conduct and error on the part of an 
individual is occasioned by restimulation of his reactive mind. 

None of these minds are “unconscious,” nor are they subconscious. The entire organism 
is always conscious but the temporary dispersion of the thought processes of the analytical mind 
brings about a condition whereby that mind, having been dispersed and considering itself the 
residence of the person, is unable to obtain and reach data perceived and received by the organism 
during the analytical mind’s condition of dispersion. That the analytical mind can be thrown, by 
pain or shock, out of circuit is a survival factor of its own: as sensitive “machinery” it must be 
protected by a fuse system.

.c.THE DYNAMICS 


The basic dynamic, SURVIVE, increases in complexity as the complexity of the 
organism evolves. Energy may be considered to have taken many paths through eternity to arrive 
intact at the infinite goal. The “why” of the goal may lie above the finite line but below it, 
demarked by the word SURVIVE, definite manifestations are visible. Energy collects into various 
forms of matter which collect and aggregate in various materials and compounds. Life evolves 
from the simplest basic into complex forms since evolutionary change is in itself a method of 
survival. 

Conflict amongst species and individuals within the species is additionally a survival 
factor. Affinity of individuals for groups, races, and the whole of its species, and for other 
species, is additionally a survival factor, as strong or stronger than conflict. 

Drive is defined as the dynamic thrust through time toward the attainment of the goal. 
Survive is considered to be the lowest common denominator of all energy efforts and all forms. It 
can then be subdivided specifically into several drive lines as applicable to each form or species. 
The unaberrated self contains eight main drives which are held in common with man. 

The dynamics are: One, self; Two, sex; Three, group; Four, mankind; Five, life; Six, the 
physical universe; Seven, thought; Eight, universal thought or infinity. 

An entire philosophy can be built around each one of these dynamics which will account 
for all the actions of an individual. Any one of these philosophies is so complete that it can be 
logically made to include the other seven. In other words, all purpose of an individual can be 
rationalized into the dynamic of self. A philosophy exists which attempts to rationalize everything 
into the sexual dynamic, and so on with all the dynamics. Observing that each one can stand as a 
logical unity, one finds it necessary to retire to the lowest common denominator of the basic 
dynamic which actually does explain the eight subdivisions. As each one of the subdivisions is 
capable of supporting the whole weight of a rational argument, it can readily be deduced that each 
is of nearly equal importance in the individual. The aberrated conditions of a society tend to vary 
the stress on these dynamics, making first one and then another the keynote of the society. 

In an unaberrated individual or society, the validity of all eight would be recognized. 

The unaberrated individual may physiologically possess or environmentally stress one or 
more of these dynamics above the others. In terms of basic personality, the 
physiological-environmental-educational aspect of the individual is of varied strength in the eight 
dynamics. 

Each one of the eight dynamics breaks further into purposes which are specific and 
complex. Purposes and other factors entangle these dynamics, and varying situations and the 
observational power of the individual may conflict one of these dynamics against another within 
the individual himself. This is a basic complex factor of unaberrated personality. 

I. THE DYNAMIC OF SELF consists of the dynamic thrust to survive as an individual, 
to obtain pleasure as an individual, and to avoid pain. It covers the general field of food, clothing 
and shelter, personal ambition, and general individual purpose. 

II. THE DYNAMIC OF SEX embraces the procreation of progeny, the care of that 
progeny, and the securing for that progeny of better survival conditions and abilities in the future. 


8 



III. THE DYNAMIC OF GROUP embraces the various units of the species man, such as 
the association, the military company, the people in the surrounding countryside, the nation and 
the race. It is characterized by activity on the part of the individual to obtain and maintain the 
survival of the group of which he is a part. 

IV. THE MANKIND DYNAMIC embraces the survival of the species. 

Note: The first four dynamics belong to Dianetics. The upper four, introduced late 1950, 
complete the full eight dynamics of Scien to logy . 

V. THE DYNAMIC OF LIFE is the urge of the individual to survive for life and for life 
to survive for itself. 

VI. THE PHYSICAL UNIVERSE DYNAMIC is the drive of the individual to enhance 
the survival of all matter, energy, time and space. 

VII. THE THOUGHT DYNAMIC concerns the urge of the individual to survive as 

thought. 


VIII. THE DYNAMIC OF UNIVERSAL THOUGHT is the urge of the individual to 
survive for the Creator. 

While man is concerned with any one of the above dynamics, any one of them may 
become antipathetic to his own survival. This is rational conflict and is normally and commonly 
incidental to survival. It is non-aberrative in that it is rational within the educational limitation. 

The family as a unit is not a dynamic but a combination of dynamics. And in this and 
other societies it attains a position of interest which is not necessarily inherent in the individual or 
group. 


Basically simple, complexity is introduced amongst the dynamics by individual and 
group irrationalities. The basic (unaberrated) individual has continual difficulty rationalizing the 
problems of importances and choices amongst these dynamics. When the basic individual 
becomes aberrated and is attendantly unable to reason freely on all problems, a selection of 
importances amongst these dynamics becomes nearly impossible and produces aberrated solutions 
which may resolve such an extreme as the destruction of the individual himself, by himself, under 
the mistaken solution that he may thus obey the primary command. 

Note: All self-destructive effort is irrationality of a precise nature which will often be 
found by the auditor in his preclear4 during auditingS but which forms no part of the basic 
personality of that individual. 

4 preclear: this term covers anyone who is not CLEAR; however, it is principally used to 
describe a person who, through auditing, is finding out more about himself and life. 

5 auditing: the application of Dianetic procedures to a preclear by a trained Dianetic 

auditor.

.c.THE BASIC INDIVIDUAL 


For the purposes of this work the terms basic individ ual and Clear are nearly 
synonymous since they denote the unaberrated self in complete integration and in a state of 
highest possible rationality; a CIear6 is one who has become the basic individual through auditing. 

The precise personality of the basic individual is of interest to the auditor. His complete 
characteristic is established by: 1. The strength of his basic DYNAMIC; 2. The relative strengths 
of his dynamics; 3. The sensitivity, which is to say the intelligence, of his analyzer; 4. The 
coordination of his motor controls; 5. His physiological and glandular condition; 6. His 
environment and education. 

The experiences of each individual also create an individual composite and so may 
additionally designate individuality. There are as many distinct individuals on earth as there are 
men, women and children. That we can establish a common denominator of drive and basic 
function does not, cannot, and will not alter the fact that individuals are amazingly varied one 
from the next. 

It will be found by experience and exhaustive research, as it has been clinically 
established, that the basic individual is invariably responsive in all the dynamics and is essentially 
“good.” There are varying degrees of courage but in the basic individual there is no pusillanimity. 
The virtues of the basic individual are innumerable. His intentional vices and destructive 
dramatizations are non-existent. He is in close alignment with that ideal which mankind 
recognizes as an ideal. This is a necessary part of an auditor’s working knowledge, since 
deviations from it denote the existence of aberration, and such departures are unnatural and 
enforced and are no part of the self-determinism of the individual. 

Man is not a reactive animal. He is capable of self-determinism. He has will power. He 
ordinarily has high analytical ability. He is rational and he is happy and integrated only when he is 
his own basic personality. 

The most desirable state in an individual is complete self-determinism. Such 
self-determinism may be altered and shaped to some degree by education and environment, but so 
long as the individual is not aberrated, he is in possession of self-determinism. So long as he is 
self-determined in his actions he adjusts himself successfully to the degree that his environment 
will permit such an adjustment. He will be more forceful, effective and happier in that 
environment than when aberrated. 

That the basic personality is “good” does not mean that he cannot be a terribly effective 
enemy of those things rationally recognizable as destructive to himself and to his. 

The basic individual is not a buried unknown or a different person, but an intensity of all 
that is best and most able in the person. The basic individual equals the same person minus his 
pain and dramatizations. 

The drive strength of the person does not derive from his aberrations. The aberrations 
lessen the drive strength. Artistry, personal force, personality, all are residual in the basic 
personality. This is derived from clinical research and experimentation. The only reason an 
aberree occasionally holds hard to his aberrations is due to the fact that his engrams have a content 
which forbids their removal. 

The reactive mind consists of a collection of experiences received during an unanalytical 
moment which contain pain and actual or conceived antagonism to the survival of the individual. 


10 



An engram is a perceptic entity which can be precisely defined. The aggregate of engrams 
compose the reactive mind. 

A new sub-field entitled “Perceptics” has been originated here to define adequately 
engramic data. Perceptics contains as one of its facets the field of semantics. Precisely as the field 
of semantics is organized so is organized in perceptics each sensory perception. 

The audio-syllabic communication system of man has its counterpart in various languages 
observable in lower animals. Words are sounds in syllabic form delivered with a definite timbre, 
pitch, and volume or sight recognition in each case. Words are a highly specialized form of 
audio-perceptics. The quality of the sound in uttering the word is nearly as important as the word 
itself. The written word belongs in part to visioperceptics. Having but lately acquired his 
extensive vocabulary, the mind of man is least adjusted to words and their sense. The mind is 
better able to differentiate amongst qualities of utterance than amongst the meanings of words 
themselves. 

Included in perceptics in the same fashion and on the same axioms as semantics are the 
other sensory perceptions — organic sensation, the tactile sense, the olfactory sense and the senses 
involved with sight and hearing. Each has its own grouping. And each carries its class of 
messages with highly complex meanings. Each one of these divisions of the senses is plotted in 
time according to the earliest or most forceful significances. Each class of messages is so filed as 
to lead the individual toward pleasure and away from pain. The classifications and study of this 
varied sensory file has been designated “Perceptics.” 

Engrams are received into the mind forming a reactive area during moments of lowered 
analytical awareness of the individual, and they contain physical pain and antagonism to survival. 
The engram is a packaged perceptic not available to the analytical mind but intimately connected to 
the physio-animal mind. Under normal conditions it reacts as a dramatization of itself when 
approximated by the organism’ s perceptions of its content in the immediate environment during 
periods of weariness, illness, or hypnotic moments in the life of the individual. 

When injury or illness supplants the analytical mind producing what is commonly known 
as “unconsciousness” and when physical pain and antagonism to the survival of the organism are 
present, an engram is received by the individual. Subsequently, during moments when the 
potential of the analytical mind is reduced by weariness, illness or similar circumstances, one or 
more of the perceptics contained in the engram may be observed by the individual in his 
environment, and without his perceiving that he has observed it (or the identity of it) the 
individual dramatizes the moment of receipt of the engram. 

An engram impedes one or more dynamics of the basic individual. Being antagonistic to 
his survival it can be considered analogically to consist of a reverse charge. 

As an example, the analytical mind can be said to possess multiple scanners in layers. 
Ordinary or pleasurable memory can be considered to have, as an analogy only, a positive charge. 
The multiple scanners are able to sweep these areas and make available memory data to the 
analytical mind so that it can arrive by various mathematical means at a solution for its various 
problems. 

The engram, as a specific memory package, can be considered to have a reverse charge 
which cannot be reached by the scanner of the analytical mind but which is directly connected to 
the motor controls and other physical functions and which can exert, at a depth not nearly as basic 
as the basic drive but nevertheless low, a hidden influence upon the analytical mind through 
another circuit. The analytical mind in awareness of now, nevertheless, is unable to discover, 


11 



without assistance from an auditor, the existence of such an impediment since it was received 
during a moment of extremely low potential on the part of the analytical mind. 

As a further analogy, and for demonstration only, an engram can be considered to be a 
bundle of perceptions of a precise nature. An engram is an entire dramatic sequence, implanted 
during unconsciousness, which possesses specific perceptic keys, any one of which, when 
unanalytically perceived by the individual in his environment, may in greater or lesser degrees set 
the engram into reaction. 

Denied to the analytical mind at its reception, it is denied to the analytical mind in its exact 
character during its dramatization. Its content is literal and, on the physio-animal level, demands 
action. Man’s analytical ability and his vocabulary are imposed above both the physio-animal 
mind and the reactive mind, both on the evolutionary time track and in awareness. The charge 
contained in the engram is inexhaustible and remains reactive in full force whenever keyed into the 
circuit by restimulators. 

Restimulators are those approximations in the environment of an individual of the content 
of an engram. Restimulators can exist in any of the various senses. The orderly filing of 
perceptics in the memory does not, apparently, include the content of engrams, these being filed 
separately under an “immediate danger” heading. 

There are three kinds of thought: the first is engramic, or literal. It demands immediate 
action without examination by the analytical mind. A hand being withdrawn from a hot stove 
when burned is being governed by the reactive principle, but as the ensuing instant of 
unconsciousness caused by the shock is ordinarily slight, no real engram can be said to have 
formed. 


The second type of thought is justified thought. Engramic thought is literal, without 
reason, irrational. Justified thought is the attempt of the analytical mind to explain the reactive, 
engramic reactions of the organism in the ordinary course of living. Every engram may cause 
some form of aberrated conduct on the part of the individual. Justified thought is the effort of the 
conscious mind to explain away that aberration without admitting, as it cannot do normally, that it 
has failed the organism. 

The third and optimum type of thought is rational thought. This is the thought used by a 

“Clear.” 


An engram is an apparent surcharge in the mental circuit with certain definite finite 
content. That charge is not reached or examined by the analytical mind but that charge is capable 
of acting as an independent command. 

When the basic drive of the individual is boosted in potential by an observed necessity, 
the residual charge in an engram is insufficient to contest, at times, the raised purpose. The 
analytical mind can then be seen to function in entire command of the organism without serious 
modification by engramic command. 

At other times, hostility in the environment and confusion of the analytical mind combine 
to reduce the dynamic potential to such a degree that the engramic command, in comparison to the 
basic drive, can be seen to be extremely powerful. It is at such times, in the presence of even faint 
restimulators, that the individual most demonstrates his aberrations. 

EXAMPLE: Engram received at the age of three and one-half years. Adult preclear. As 
child in dental chair, against his will, under antagonistic conditions, given nitrous oxide and 


12 



tricked by dentist. During painful portion of treatment the dentist says, “He is asleep. He can’t 
hear, feel or see anything. Stay there.” 

The perceptics which can be restimulated in this are the quality, pitch and volume of the 
dentist’s voice; the sound of the dentist’s drill; the slap of the cable running the drill; street noises 
of a specific kind; the tactile of the mouth being forcibly held open; the smell of the mask; the 
sound of running water; the smell of nitrous oxide; and in short, several of each perceptic class, 
excluding only sight. 

The effect of this experience, being a part of an engramic chain which contained two 
earlier experiences, was in some small degree to trance the individual and maintain some portion 
of him in a regressed state. 

This engram is too brief and extraordinarily simple but it will serve as an example to the 
auditor. The timeless quality of the suggestions, the conceived antagonism, precursors9 on the 
engramic chain awakened and re-enforced, all these things confused the time sense of the 
individual and were otherwise reactive in later life. 

For every engram there is a somatic as part of that engram. No aberration exists without 
its somatics unless it is a racial-educational aberration, in which instance it is compatible with its 
environment and so is not considered irrational. 

Every aberration contains its exact command in some engram. 

The numbers of engrams per individual are relatively few. The aberrated condition of the 
individual does not depend on the number of engrams but the severity of individual engrams. 

An engram is severe in the exact ratio that it is conceived by the organism to have been a 
moment of threat to survival. The character of the threat and the perceptic content produce the 
aberration. A number of engrams with similar perceptics in an individual produce a complex 
aberration pattern which nevertheless has for its parts individual engrams. 

An aberration is the manifestation of an engram and is serious only when it influences the 
competence of the individual in his environment. 

Engrams are of two types depending upon the duration of restimulation. There are 
“floaters” and “chronics.” A floater has not been restimulated in the individual during the lifetime 
succeeding it. A chronic is an engram which has been more or less continuously restimulated so 
that it has become an apparent portion of the individual. A chronic begins to gather “locks.” A 
floater has not accumulated locks since it has never been restimulated. 

A lock can be conceived to be joined to an engram in such a way that it can be reached by 
the multiple scanners of the analytical mind which cannot reach the engram. A lock is a painful 
mental experience. It is or is not regarded by the analytical mind as a source of difficulty or 
aberration. It is a period of mental anguish and is wholly dependent upon an engram for its pain 
value. When an engram is activated into a chronic, it accumulates numerous locks along the time 
track of the individual. The engram itself is not immediately locatable, except somatically, along 
the time track of the individual. Locks are of some diagnostic value but, as they exist as 
experiences more or less recallable by the analytical mind, they can be depended upon to vanish 
upon the removal of the engram from the reactive mind. 

The running of a lock as a lock has some value but the exhaustion of locks from an 
aberrated individual is long and arduous and is seldom productive of any lasting result. Upon the 
location and exhaustion of the engram from the reactive mind, all of its locks vanish. An engram 


13 



may exist unactivated as a floater for any number of years or for the entire duration of an indi- 
vidual’ s life. At any future moment after the receipt of an engram, whether that time period 
consists of days or decades, the floater may reactivate at which time it becomes part of the 
command obeyed by the analytical mind in its efforts to rationalize. The removal of the individual 
from his restimulators, which is to say, the environment in which the engram was reactive, is in 
itself a form of therapy, since the engram may then return to its status as a floater. 

EXAMPLE: Engram — At birth occurs the phrase, “No good,” uttered during a moment 
of headache and gasping on the part of a child. 

Lock: At the age of seven while the child was ill with a minor malady, the mother in a fit 
of rage said that he was “no good.” 

The removal of the engram also removes, ordinarily without further attention, the lock. 

Note: Birth remained inactive in the above case as a floater until the moment of reduced 
analytical power at the age of seven when a birth phrase was repeated. It is worth remarking that 
the entire content of the birth engram is given simultaneously both to the child and to the mother, 
with only the difference of somatics. It is further worthy of note that the mother quite often 
perceives in the child a restimulator and uses against it the phrases which were said when the child 
gave the mother the greatest pain, namely, birth. The child is then victimized into various 
psychosomatic ills by the repetition of its birth engram restimulators, which may develop even 
more seriously into actual disease. 

The brain controls the multiple and complex functions of the growth and condition of the 
organism. Containing organic sensation as one of its perceptics, the engram then, when 
reactivated, causes a somatic and additionally may deny body fluids, i.e. hormones and blood, to 
some portion of the anatomy, occasioning psychosomatic ills. The denial of fluid or adequate 
blood supply may result in a potentially infective area. The psychosomatic reduces the resistance 
of some portion of the body to actual disease. 

Somatic and other sensory errors find their basis in unconscious antagonistic moments. A 
somatic may be adjusted by an address to a lock but. the permanency of adjustment obtains only 
until such time as the engram is again reactivated, causing another lock. 

All aberrations are occasioned by engrams. 

An engram is severely painful or severely threatening to the survival of the organism and 
is an engram only if it cannot be reached by the awake analytical mind. 

A simple approximation of the action of an engram can be accomplished by an experiment 
in hypnotism whereby a positive suggestion which contains a posthypnotic signal is delivered to 
an amnesia-tranced person. The subject, having been commanded to forget the suggestion when 
awake, will then perform the act. This suggestion is then actually a light portion of the reactive 
mind. It is literally interpreted, unquestionably followed, since it is received during a period of 
unawareness of the analytical mind or some portion of it. The restimulator, which may be the act 
of the operator adjusting his tie, causes the subject to commit some act. The subject will then try 
to explain why he is doing what he is doing, no matter how illogical that action may be. The 
post-hypnotic suggestion is then recalled to the subject’s mind and he remembers it. The 
compulsion vanishes (unless it is laid upon an actual engram). 

The obedience of the subject to the command has, as its source, engramic thought. The 
explanation by the subject for his own action is the analytical mind observing the organism, which 


14 



it supposes is in its sole charge, and justifying itself. The release of the post-hypnotic suggestion 
into the analytical mind brings about rational thought. 

Engrams can be considered to be painfully inflicted, often timeless, post-hypnotic 
suggestions delivered antagonistically to the “unconscious” subject. The posthypnotic suggestion 
given the subject in the above example would not have any permanent effect on the subject even if 
it were not removed by the operator, because there was presumed to be no antagonism involved 
(unless, of course, it rested on a former engram). 

The physio-animal mind of an organism never ceases recording on some level. The exact 
moment when recording begins in an organism has not at this date been accurately determined. It 
has been found to be very early, probably earlier than four months after conception and five 
months before birth. In the presence of pain, any moment prior to the age of two years may be 
considered to be unanalytical. Any painful experience received by the foetus contains its full 
perceptic package, including darkness. 

Once an auditor has worked a prenatal engram and has seen its influence upon the 
engramic chain and the awake life of the adult, no question will remain in his 

mind concerning the actuality of the experience. That the foetus does record is attributable 
to a phenomenon of the extension of perceptions during moments of pain and the absence of the 
analytical mind. 

Laboratory experiment demonstrates that under hypnosis an individual’s sensory 
perception may be artificially extended. 

The existence of pain in any large degree is sufficient to extend the hearing of the foetus 
so that it records, during the existence of pain and the presence of exterior sound, the entire and 
complete record of the experience. As a chronic engram is but precariously fixed on the mind, the 
syllables or voice timbres contained in the prenatal will reactivate the somatic and the emotional 
engramic content whenever the approximations of that engram appear in the child’s (or the 
adult’s) vicinity. 

The understanding of language is not necessary to reactivate an engram since the 
recording of the brain is so precise that the utterance of the identical words in similar tones during 
later prenatal periods or during birth, or immediately after birth, can and may occasion the original 
prenatal or any of the prenatals to become reactive, producing locks, injuring the health of the 
infant or, for that matter, of the foetus. 

The perceptics of the foetus are extended only during moments of pain. But a chain of 
prenatal engrams can occasion a condition wherein the hearing of the foetus is chronically 
extended, forming numerous locks before birth. These locks will vanish when the actual engrams 
are discovered and exhausted from the psyched. 

Any painful unanalytical moment containing antagonism is not only a matter of record but 
a source of potential action in the human organism at any period during its lifetime, reserving, of 
course, the question of when the foetus first begins to record. 

Birth is ordinarily a severely painful unconscious experience. It is ordinarily an engram 
of some magnitude. Anyone who has been born then possesses at least one engram. Any period 
of absence of analytical power during receipt of physical pain has some engramic potentiality. 


15 



Moments when the analytical power is present in some quantity, when physical pain is 
absent and only antagonism to the organism is present do not form engrams and are not 
responsible for the aberration of the individual. 

Sociological maladjustments; parental punishments of a minor sort, even when they 
include pain; libidos; childhood struggles and jealousies are not capable of aberrating the 
individual. These can influence the personality and environmental adjustment of the individual but 
so long as he is not pathologically incompetent, he can and will resolve these problems and 
remain without aberration. 

The human mind is an enormously powerful organism and its analytical ability is great. It 
is not overlaid above naturally unsocial or evil desires, but is founded upon powerful and 
constructive basics which only powerful, painful and antagonistic experiences can impede. 
Engrams will be found to have been conceived by the individual as intensely antagonistic to the 
survival of the organism. 

The discovery of the basic engram is the first problem of the auditor. It normally results 
in an engramic chain. The content of that chain will be found to be physically severe. 

An engram is physically painful, is conceived by the organism as an antagonistic threat to 
its survival, and is received during the absence of the analytical power of the mind. These factors 
may vary within the engram so that an engram may be of minimal pain, maximal antagonism and 
minimal absence of the analytical power. 

NOTE: ONE HAS AS MUCH FUNCTIONING ANALYZER AS ONE HAS 
AWARENESS OF NO W. 

The body is to some degree reliving the experience of the engram whenever the 
experience is restimulated. A chronic psychosomatic, such as a painful arm, indicates the chronic, 
continuous coexistence with NOW of the moment the arm was broken or hurt. Several engrams 
reactivated into a chronic state bring several moments of unconsciousness, pain, and antagonism 
into a coexistence with NO W. The engram is a bundle of perceptics which include, as the primary 
manifestation, organic sensation. The organic sensation is enforced on the members of the body 
to a greater or lesser degree whenever, and as long as, the engram is restimulated. There is only 
one psychosomatic command which is common to all engrams. Any engram contains this as part 
of the command it will enforce upon the body. As a stomach may be made to ache chronically 
(ulcers), to feel broken, the engram also enforces a command upon the organ of the analytical 
mind. That command is common to every engram. Engrams are valid only when they are received 
during a momentary dispersal or shocked, null condition of the analytical mind. Every engram 
contains and enforces the command on the analytical mind that it has been dispersed and is not 
operating. This is common to every engram. This is reduction of the intellect by engrams totally 
aside from specific engramic content. It explains at once insanity and also the remarkable mental 
facility of a cleared or released individual. 


16 



.c. ABERRATIONS 


All aberrations of any kind are of precisely the same nature (as covered in the last 
chapter). It is the content of the engram which causes the aberration and forms its nature. 
Complexity amongst engramic contents may demonstrate a most complex aberration. 

The various commands contained in the engrams, reactivating and modifying the basic 
dynamic command of the mind, produce abnormal characteristics in the behavior of the analytical 
mind, which are chronic or sporadic as the engrams occasioning them are restimulated. An entire 
concept of existence may be built from engramic content. Conflicts in the commands contained in 
engrams and conflicts between the basic drive and the engramic contents combine into behavior 
patterns. 

When the organism has become so impeded that it can no longer influence or command 
its environment, it can be considered to be insane in that environment. Change of environment 
may relieve the condition or, more certainly, the exhaustion of the content of the reactive mind 
will restore the ability of the analytical mind to solve the problems with which it is confronted. 

Whatever the engramic content of the reactive mind and its potential influence upon the 
behavior of the individual, it does not necessarily follow that the reactive mind need be chronically 
restimulated. However, when the reactive mind has been restimulated consistently, the analytical 
mind, called upon to solve the problems around and through antagonistic and incorrect data, may 
be unable to perform its task. In the absence of disease or injury, any mind not in a physiological 
amnesia state may be restored to normal function by the removal of the reactive mind. It should be 
noted however that this is modified by the fact that people who have received insulin shocks, 
prefrontal lobotomies, electric shocks and other treatments are regarded as equivocal and are 
temporarily classed with disease cases for lack of adequate observation in this stage of the 
experimental research. 

People can be regarded as rational or irrational only insofar as they react in their 
customary environment. But any person in possession of a reactive mind is an unknown quantity 
until that reactive mind has been examined. 

There are several factors contained in the engrams in the reactive mind which most 
certainly tend toward aberration. These include engramic commands which derange the time sense 
of the individual and thus apparently destroy his time track and engrams which contain 
restimulators of such timelessness and such perceptic content remain thereafter continually with 
the individual and seem to arrest him or regress him in time. Engrams containing commands 
which make the individual chronically unable to conceive differences are especially harmful since 
these tend to compare everything to engramic value and thus cause the individual to arrive at a 
chronic state of engramic thinking. 

The mind resolves problems related to survival, utilizing its ability to conceive similarities 
and obser\>e differences. 

Engrams which destroy or tend to hold in suspension the analytical mind’s ability to 
conceive associations most influence the apparent intelligence of the mind. But engrams which 
tend, by their command content, to destroy the mind’s ability to conceive differences may produce 
severe aberration. 

EXAMPLE: “All men are alike,” received as powerful engramic content would tend to 
compare and associate every man with those men contained in the reactive mind as painful and 
dangerous. 


17 



An aberration may attain any form of complexion. As a rough analogy: a compulsion may 
be conceived to be an engramic command that the organism must do something; a repression is a 
command that the organism must not do something; a neurosis is an emotional state containing 
conflicts and emotional data inhibiting the abilities or welfare of the individual; and a psychosis is 
a conflict of commands which seriously reduce the individual’s ability to solve his problems in his 
environment to a point where he cannot adjust some vital phase of his environmental needs. 

All this variety of manifestation of aberration is occasioned by the pain-enforced 
commands or contents of engrams. 

Physical aberrations are occasioned by engrams when they are not the result of injury or 
disease; even, then, the aspect may be improved by the exhaustion of the reactive mind of the sick 
individual. The engram cannot manifest itself as a mental aberration without also manifesting itself 
to some degree as somatic aberration. Removal of the somatic content of engrams which is also 
necessary to obtain any other relief, can and does occasion glandular readjustment, cellular 
inhibition and other physiological corrections. 


18 



.c.THE TONE SCALE 


The tone scale denotes numerically, first the status of an engram in the reactive mind, 
next its erasure or reduction, and provides a measure for sanity in an individual. 

The derivation of this scale is clinical and is based upon observation of engrams being 
worked. When an engram is located and developed, the extreme range it can follow begins with 
apathy, develops into anger (or the various facets of antagonism), proceeds into boredom, and 
arrives at last in cheerfulness or vanishes utterly. 

The tone scale is essentially an assignation of numerical value by which individuals can 
be numerically classified. It is not arbitrary but will be found to approximate some actual 
governing law in nature. 

Zero is equivalent to death. An individual with a zero tone would be dead. 

Ranging upwards from zero to one then is that emotional bracket which may be denoted 
as apathy along its graduated scale from death to the beginnings of apathetic resentment. 

From one to two is the range of antagonism, including suspicion, resentment, and anger. 

Boredom and its equivalents, by which is denoted minor annoyance, begin at two and 
end at three. 

From three to four are the emotions which range from carelessness to cheerfulness. 

The term tone four denotes a person who has achieved rationality and cheerfulness. 

Each engram residual in the reactive mind has its own independent tonal value. Serious 
engrams will be found in the apathy range. Dangerous engrams will be found in the anger range. 
Above two point five an engram could not be considered to have any great power to affect the 
analytical mind. Each engram in the reactive mind then can be said to possess a tone value. The 
composite sum of these engrams will give, if added, a numerical value to the reactive mind. 

Engrams can be computed as they lie along the dynamics, and to each dynamic may be 
assigned a tone. The sum of the tones of the dynamics, divided by the number of the dynamics, 
will give a potential numerical value for an individual. This, of course, is variable depending on 
the existence of restimulators in his environment to reactivate the engrams. 

The probable average of mankind at this writing may be in the vicinity of 3.0. Complete 
rationality depends upon exhaustion of the reactive mind and complete rationality is invariably the 
result of reaching tone four. 

The initial diagnosis is done by the assignation of a general tone to denote the condition 
of an individual’s reactive mind. His methods of meeting life, his emotional reaction to the 
problems in his environment, can be evaluated by the use of the tone scale. 

In auditing, as will be covered later, an engram normally can be expected to run from its 
initial value in the apathy or anger range to tone four. Very shortly after it reaches tone four it 
should vanish. If it vanishes without attaining the laughter of tone four it can be assumed that the 
individual’s basic engram has not been erased. 

The tone scale has value in auditing and should be thoroughly understood. 


19 



.c.THE CHARACTER OF ENGRAMS 


There are several general types of engrams. It must be understood that the mind 
possesses a time track of one sort or another and that this track is a specific thing. The time track 
of an individual will include all those things available to his analytical mind when in a light trance 
or during regression. However, a person can be regressed and the data which he can easily 
contact along his time track is definitely not engramic even if it possesses an emotional charge. 
Everything on this track will be rational or justified experience. It will not include engrams. It may 
include locks — which is to say that it may include moments of mental anguish or antagonism and 
may even include instants of unconsciousness which have some slight engramic command value. 

An engram has several specific, positive characteristics. It is received by the individual at 
some moment of physical pain. It is not available to the analyzer and it includes conceived or 
actual antagonism to the survival of the organism. Certain mechanics such as “forget it” may 
swerve a minimumly painful or unconscious experience off the time track. In that case it becomes 
possessed of engramic command value. 

All engrams with power to derange the analytical mind and aberrate the physical body lie 
off the time track and are not available to the analytical mind. 

By reason of its disorganization during the moment the engram was received, or because 
it has been forcibly instructed that the data in the engram is not to be recalled, the analyzer cannot 
reach the engram by ordinary means because the data has been erroneously labelled “dangerous,” 
“important,” or “too painful to touch.” The engram then, by a bypass circuit, feeds hidden 
commands into the analyzer. By a direct instantaneous circuit it is permanently connected to the 
motor controls, all perceptic channels, the glands, and heart. It is awaiting a moment of low 
general tone, weariness, or injury when the analytical mind has reduced powers. It is also 
awaiting the perception of one or more of the engram’ s restimulators in the environment of the 
organism. 

Continuous restimulation of the engrams can, in itself, cause a low general tone which in 
its turn permits more engrams to become restimulated. As the reactive mind comes into a more or 
less completely chronic state of restimulation, the individual becomes more and more governed by 
this mind. His thought becomes more and more engramic and he can be seen to drop in general 
tone on the tone scale down to the break point which may be arbitrarily placed somewhere 
between 2 and 2.5 and below which lies the region of insanity. 

Engramic thought is irrational identity-thought by which the mind is made to conceive 
identities where only vague similarities may exist. It is necessary that the auditor thoroughly 
understand engramic thought, for it is with this complete irrationality of identity that he will 
basically deal. As he works with any preclear, he must continually employ in the bulk of his 
computation on the case the equation of engramic thinking. 

Engramic thinking can be stated by: A equals A equals A equals A equals A. 

The engram, when one or more of its restimulators is perceived in the environment 
during a moment of low general tone, may dramatize. The dramatization is the precise content of 
the engram. The aberration is the precise content of the engram. The reaction of an individual’s 
analytical mind when an engram is reactivated is justification. 

There is reason to believe that part of this survival mechanism consists of the axiom: The 
analyzer must never permit an incorrect solution. The engram brings about many incorrect 


20 



solutions. The analyzer may very well become entirely involved with the attempt to discover and 
deliver to a society, or to itself, adequate rational reasons for the behavior of the organism. 

The analytical mind, though working from the command of the engram itself, is unaware 
of the source of the command. Not being able to discover the source, 

it introverts more and more in an effort to solve a problem which contains danger to the 
organism. The analytical mind tends to find the danger without and within the organism. 

There are five ways that the organism can react to a danger in its vicinity. It can attack it, 
avoid it, neglect it, run from it, or succumb to it. In just these ways can the analytical mind, 
which, it must be remembered, is possessed of self-determinism and will power, react to the 
reactive mind. As the general tone lowers, as the analytical mind becomes less and less powerful 
through weariness, continual reverses in general health, etc., the more and more heed it must give 
to the problems unsolved in the reactive mind. These are in essence unsolved problems. As such, 
they contain their own solutions. The analytical mind, unable to reach them, justifies the 
organism’s reaction to them (succumbs to them), causes the organism to attempt to flee from 
them, apathetically may neglect them (as in prefrontal lobotomy), avoids them in many intricate 
ways, or attacks them. The analytical mind is not only not certain where the experience lies on the 
time track, it also does not know whether the menace is within the organism or without it. So it 
can become entirely indiscriminate, and eventually it may achieve highly irrational solutions by 
which it seeks to solve the problems of the highly irrational reactive mind. 

The deep sensory perception channel entering the mind is evidently equipped with an 
“appreciator” which sorts according to the momentary general tone or potential of the analytical 
mind. The higher the general tone or potential of the analytical mind the better the data in the 
appreciator is sorted. The appreciator circuits are evidently fully apprised of engramic content in 
the reactive mind and evaluate restimulators perceived in the environment against the general tone 
of the analytical mind. When that is low, restimulators route more or less directly to the reactive 
mind which instantly responds by fixed connections into the motor controls. Commands to the 
various members, muscles, glands and organs of the body may be sporadic or constant, 
producing a high variety of responses in the body. Entire vocabularies are fed into the voice 
circuits directly from the reactive mind when an engram is restimulated. Orders to be active or 
inactive are fed to other portions. The individual time track of the engram spaces the commands to 
the organism and a dramatization is accomplished which may contain a portion or all of the 
content of the engram as governed by the situation. Psychosomatic ills, hysterias, rages, 
tantrums, criminal acts and any and all content prejudicial to the survival of the organism in which 
the organism is seen to be indulging has as its source the reactive mind. 

The sole and only content of the reactive mind is what exterior sources have done to the 
organism. 

None of the content of the reactive mind is selfmotivated. The auditor is then interested 
only in what is done to the person, not what the person himself has 

done, since, for purposes of auditing, the acts of the organism in its society can be 
discounted beyond diagnosis. Even then they are of small importance to the auditor. 

An organism possessed of an analytical mind, not victimized by incapacitating disease or 
injury (and unimpeded) will commit no act knowingly prejudicial to the survival of the organism 
or other facets within the dynamics. It will combat only those dangers in society which are actual 
menaces. 


21 



Whatever may be the status of the “innate moral sense,” the basic intent of the basic 
personality is to further various energy forms along the dynamics toward the goal. Only moments 
of actual dispersal of the awareness of the analytical mind permit data to be received which is 
prejudicial to the intent of the dynamics. Only from these “unconscious” moments can the 
basically stable and enormously powerful and able analytical mind be aberrated through the 
implantation of unanalyzed, painfully administered, and antagonistic infommation. It is the 
purpose of the auditor to find and exhaust these moments from the life of the individual. Dianetic 
auditing includes therefore, as its basic principle, the exhaustion of all the painfully unconscious 
moments of a subject’s life. By eradicating pain from the life of an individual, the auditor returns 
the individual to complete rationality and sanity. 

The auditor should never be content with merely bringing the person back to normal. He 
should achieve with the person a tone 4 even though this is far in advance of the average state of 
society at this time. A tone 4 with his drives intact and powerful, with his rationality and 
intelligence increased to the optimum, becomes extremely valuable to the society, whatever his 
past. 


Knowing this the auditor can expect a maximum result of lasting duration with any 
preclear not physically hopeless. 

The entire purpose of the auditor is to rehabilitate the basic dynamic and the normal 
purpose or profession of the individual whom he audits. Anything implanted by positive 
suggestion or “education” in the course of auditing is harmful and must be cancelled if delivered. 
Only the basic personality of the individual can decide and evaluate things in his environment. 
Therefore, hypnotism as practiced with positive suggestions should be shunned since any and all 
hypnotic commands with the attendant forgetter mechanisms are no more than artificially 
implanted engrams. Indeed, it is quite usual for the auditor to have to exhaust hypnotically im- 
planted material received either from some hypnotist or from the analytical mind itself when the 
person has been operating under auto-control. Hypnotism as such does not work, and a study and 
short practice in Dianetics will reveal exactly why. 

The auditor is attempting to delete the reactive mind 

from the individual. This reactive mind is an infestation of foreign, careless and 
unreasoning commands which disrupt the self-determinism of the individual to such an extent that 
he no longer has charge, through his analytical mind, of the organism itself but finds himself 
under the continual and chronic orders of unseen, neverreviewed exterior forces, often and 
usually antipathetic to the survival of the organism. 

Engrams deal with identities where no identities exist. They therefore pose many strange 
and irrational problems which are seen as aberrations in preclears. If a human being has been 
born, he can be supposed to have at least one engram. Anyone who has a birth which has not 
been cleared by therapy has therefore a reactive mind. There is no disgrace attached to having a 
reactive mind since it was thrust without his consent and without his knowledge upon an 
unconscious and helpless individual. Sometimes this was done by persons with the best of 
imaginable intentions. A person not possessed of a rational mind cannot be rationally considered 
to be morally responsible, no matter the demands of the current society which hitherto lacked any 
method of determining responsibility. 

The pain contained in the reactive mind is normally severe. The usual parental 
punishments, family complications, reprimands, minor accidents and the battle of the individual 
with his environment, influence but do not cause a reactive mind, nor do these things have the 
power to change materially the reactions of an individual. 


22 



In the background of any individual exist many hidden personalities contained in the 
reactive mind. Dealing in identities, the reactive mind often confuses identities of individuals. 
Therefore, irrational attachments and antipathies are formed by aberrated individuals who can 
often find no reason for such attachments or antipathies in their contemporary environment. 

The content of an engram is literally interpreted, not as it was stated to the “unconscious” 
subject, but as it was received in its most literal phraseology and perception. 

The organism possesses many inherent mechanisms and abilities by which it can learn or 
preserve or forward itself along the dynamics. Any one of them may be exaggerated by engrams 
to a point where it becomes an actual threat to the organism or impedes it. Engrams can and do 
aberrate all the sensory perceptions, any and all parts of the body, and the mind itself. By 
demanding suicide the engram can destroy the entire organism. 

The error of the reactive mind was introduced by the evolution of speech, for which the 
basic mechanism was not designed. When all perceptics save speech formed the reactive mind, it 
was to some degree serviceable. With speech came such complexities of perception and such 
interchanges of ideas that a whole series of illusions and delusions could be derived from the 
reactive mind’s necessity to determine identities for purposes of emergency. 

With speech the reactive mind came to possess far more power and extensive content. 
The analytical mind, being a delicate mechanism in some respects no matter how rugged and 
capable in others, then could become subjected to delusions and illusions which, however 
shadowy and unreal, must nevertheless be obeyed. By stripping the reactive mind of its past 
painful content the analytical mind may be placed in complete command of the organism. 

The moment a man or a group becomes possessed of this ability, it becomes possessed of 
self-determinism. So long as these possess reactive minds, irrationalities will persist. Because it 
contains literal speech, no reactive mind can be conceived to be of any value whatsoever to the 
rational organism since the methods of that reactive mind remain intact and will continue to act to 
preserve the organism in times of “unconsciousness” of the analytical mind. There is no residual 
good in any reactive mind. It is capable of any illusion. It has no assist power along the dynamics 
save only to cancel or modify other reactive mind content. The source of the individual’s power 
and purpose is not derived from the reactive mind but from the Basic Dynamic and its eight 
divisions. Any auditor will establish this to his own satisfaction after he has run a very few cases. 

When an individual during auditing is attempting to “hold on to his aberrations,” the 
auditor may be assured that that person has as part of the content of the reactive mind such 
phrases as, “don’t dare get rid of it,” which, identically translated, apparently applies to aber- 
rations. It may, in fact, apply in an engram containing an attempted abortion. 

The identity factor in the reactive mind may cause the analytical mind to respond 
irrationally in auditing and to justify the aberrations in many irrational ways. Whatever means he 
uses or statements he makes to avoid the exhaustion of his reactive mind is contained exactly in 
the reactive mind as a positive suggestion and has no application whatsoever in rational thought. 

Individuality (if by that is meant a man’s desires and habits) is not traced to the reactive 
mind save when by individuality is meant those flagrant eccentricities which pass in Dickens for 
characters. 

A man is much more an individual after his reactive mind has been cleared. 


23 



.c. DRAMATIZATION 


Dramatization is the duplication of an engramic content, entire or in part, by an aberree in 
his present time environment. Aberrated conduct is entirely dramatization. Aberrated conduct will 
occur only when and if an engram exists in the reactive mind of the aberree. That conduct will be 
a duplication of such an engram. The degree of dramatization is in direct ratio to the degree of 
restimulation of the engrams causing it. A mild dramatization would be a similarity to the engram. 
A severe dramatization would be an identity with the engram. 

The general tone of an aberree, when high — when his person is unwearied and he is well 
and not directly menaced in his environment — does not permit as great an influence by the reactive 
mind, since the tone level of the entire individual possesses too great a differential from the tone 
of the engram. As the general tone of the individual approaches the tone level of the engram under 
restimulation, dramatization becomes more severe. 

The analytical mind is present to the degree that the general tone of the aberree is high. As 
this general tone lowers through ill health, reverses, or constant restimulation of the reactive 
mind, the analytical mind is proportionately less aware. Dramatization is demonstrated by the 
aberree in inverse ratio to the potential of the analytical mind. A geometrical progression is entered 
as general tone lowers to cause the analytical mind to lose its entire awareness potential. 

Once every engram contains, as the common denominator of all engrams, the 
unconsciousness of the organ which is the analytical mind, dramatizations gain rapidly as this 
interaction progresses. 

In the presence of a relatively high analytical mind awareness-potential dramatization 
takes the form of similarity. The data of the engram is present but is interspersed with or modifed 
by justified thought. The physical pain which is always present as part of the dramatization is 
equally mild, a duplication of the pain which was present during the engram. The awareness 
potential of the analytical mind reduces in the restimulation of the engram which again reduces the 
general tone. 

The aberree is subject to almost continuous dramatization of one engram or another as the 
restimulators appear in his vicinity. (Although the aberration may be so mild as to include only 
some chronically affected organ.) Complete dramatization is complete identity. It is the engram in 
full force in present time with the aberree taking one or more parts of the dramatis personae 
present in the engram. He may dramatize all the actors or merely one of them. His dramatization is 
identity, is unreasoned and always entirely reactive. When the analytical mind reaches the low 
point of awareness potential it held during the engramic incident, that point is also forced upon the 
aberree as a part of the dramatization. The aberree may also dramatize himself as he was at the 
moment of the engram’ s receipt. 

The words, physical actions, expressions, and emotions of an aberree undergoing an 
identity dramatization are those of the single or various dramatis personae present in the engram. 

An engram which can be dramatized may at any time in an aberree’ s future be dramatized 
as an identity dramatization, when and if his general tone is low and his environment becomes 
infiltrated by restimulators. 

An aberree, because of high general tone and other factors, may not suffer the 
restimulation of an engram for a number of years after its receipt. A large number of engrams may 
be present and undramatized in any aberree, if he has never been presented with their particular 
restimulators in an optimum moment for restimulation. The common denominator of all insanity is 


24 



the absence of all or almost all awareness potential in the analytical mind. Insanity can be acute or 
chronic. Any identity dramatization is insanity, by which is meant the entire absence of rationality. 

The aberree commonly and chronically dramatizes locks. The engramic content may 
compel or repress the aberree whenever restimulated. An irrational person is irrational to the 
degree that he dramatizes or succumbs to engramic content in his reactive mind. The computations 
which can be made on the basis of dramatization are infinite. The reactive mind thinks in 
identities. Dramatizations are severe as they approach identity with the engrams which force them 
into being in the conduct of the aberree. The dianeticist can profit in many ways by these 
principles of dramatization. By examination of the rage or apathy or hysteria patterns of the 
preclear, the dianeticist will find himself in possession of the exact character of the engrams for 
which he is searching. 

In the case of the manic, the fanatic, or the zealot an engram has entirely blocked at least 
one of the purpose lines deriving from a dynamic. The engram may be called an “assist engram.” 
Its own surcharge (not the dynamic force) leads the individual to believe that he has a high 
purpose which will permit him to escape pain. This “purpose” is a false purpose not ordinarily 
sympathetic with the organism, having a hectic quality derived from the pain which is part of it, 
even though that pain is not wittingly experienced. This “assist engram” is using the native ability 
of the organism to accomplish its false “purpose” and brings about a furious and destructive effort 
on the part of the individual who, without this “assist engram” could have better accomplished the 
same goal. The worst feature of the “assist engram” is that the effort it commands is engramic 
dramatization of a particular sort, and if the engram itself is restimulated the individual becomes 
subject to the physical pain and fear which the entire experience contained. Therefore, the false 
purpose itself is subject to sporadic “sag.” This sag becomes longer and longer in duration 
between periods of false thrust. It is easy to confuse, in casual observation, an “assist engram” 
and an actual, valid drive, unless one also observes the interspersed periods of “sag.” The “assist 
engram” may or may not occasionally accomplish something, but it does accomplish a confusion 
in the society that the dynamics of the individual are derived from his bad experiences. This is a 
thing which is emphatically untrue. 

Inherently the individual has great will power. This however can be aberrated. Will 
power or its absence occasions the attitude of the aberree toward his reactive mind. 

The prevention of the dramatization of an engram or a lock further reduces dynamic thrust 
of the aberree. Chronic prevention lowers his general tone toward the break point. Unhampered 
dramatization, as it contains restimulation of a physical pain and the reduced potential of the 
analytical mind, produces other harmful effects. 

Necessity can and does render inactive the entire reactive mind. Dramatization occurs 
most often in the absence of necessity or when the reactive mind has obscured the presence of 
necessity. 

Dramatization is residual in the motor controls including speech and can be allayed by the 
physical exhaustion of the individual. The organism during dramatization tends to revivify toward 
the moment of the engram’ s occurrence — the engram containing, as one of its identity parts, the 
complete physical condition of the organism as at the moment of laying-in of the engram. 

There is no folly or facet of human activity which cannot be dramatized. An immediate 
alleviation can be achieved when addressing an aberree who is in identity dramatization by acting 
upon the fact that the conditions of auditing, with no exception, already exist; i.e., the preclear 
returned to the moment of occurrence. Affinity may be established and dianetic auditing begun at 
once. He can be persuaded to listen for the phrases he is uttering and they can be alleviated by 
exhaustion on routine procedure. 


25 



.c.THE AUDITOR’S CODE 


Not because it is a pleasant thing to do or because it is a noble idea, the auditor must 
always treat a preclear in a certain definite way which can be outlined as the auditor’s code. 
Failure to follow this code will cause trouble to the auditor, will considerably lengthen and disturb 
his work and may endanger the preclear. The auditor in the first place, at the optimum, should be 
himself cleared; otherwise he will find that many of his own engrams are restimulated as he listens 
to the engrams of his preclears. This restimulation may cause his own engrams to become 
chronic, victimizing him with various allergies and delusions and causing him to be, at best, 
extremely uncomfortable. An auditor can audit while he himself is being cleared as this is a 
peculiar and special method of locating his own engrams, since they become restimulated. 
Becoming painful to him, they can be found and speedily removed. Even if he is not himself 
cleared, the auditor must act like a Clear towards the preclear. The auditor’s code is the natural 
activity of a Clear. 

The auditor must act toward the preclear exactly in the way that the preclear as an 
organism would desire that his own conscious analytical mind would react to and consider the 
organism. An affinity must therefore be maintained at all costs. 

The auditor must never permit himself to lose his temper, become aggravated, to scold or 
badger or antagonize the preclear in any way. To do so would not merely disturb the comfort of 
the preclear but might additionally derange him and might even prohibit further beneficial therapy 
by the auditor. 

The code is nearly “Christlike.” 

The auditor must be confident in that he must continually reassure the preclear when 
restimulated engrams cause despondency on the preclear’ s part. A cheerful optimistic presence 
encourages the preclear through his most painful experiences. 

The auditor must be courageous, never permitting himself to be intimidated by either the 
aggression or hostility of the preclear. 

The auditor must be kind, never indulging in hostilities or personal prejudices. The 
auditor must be trustworthy, never betraying or capriciously denying a preclear and above all 
never breaking his word to the preclear. An auditor must be clean, for personal odors or bad 
breath may be restimulators to the preclear or may disturb him. The auditor must take care not to 
offend the concepts or sensibilities of the preclear. 

The auditor must be persistent, never permitting the case of the preclear to either resist 
him or to remain unsolved until it is in a proper tone four, since the restimulation of engrams is a 
malady unto itself unless they are being properly exhausted. 

The auditor must be patient, never hurrying or harassing the preclear beyond the needs of 
stirring an engram into view. He must be willing to work at any and all times necessary and for 
the length of time necessary to exhaust the engrams in process of elimination. 

In addition to these things it may be remarked that a definite affinity is established 
between the auditor and preclear during the auditing. In the case of opposite sexes this affinity 
may amount to an infatuation. The auditor must remain aware of this and know that he can and 
should redirect the infatuation to some person or activity other than himself when auditing is at an 
end. Not to do so is to produce an eventual situation wherein the preclear may have to be rebuffed 
with consequent trouble for the auditor. 


26 



.c. AUDITING 


The auditing technique consists of assisting the preclear’ s analytical mind or some part of 
it with the auditor’ s analytical mind. The auditor then functions during each successive period of 
auditing, and only during the periods themselves, as an extra analytical mind of the preclear. 

The reactive mind was received during the dispersal or inactivity of the analytical mind. 
The reactive mind is removed by “returning” the preclear to the engram, and laying its contents 
before the scrutiny of the analytical mind. 

This technique may be considered the lowest common denominator of a number of 
techniques. Anything which will serve this purpose and permit auditing to be accomplished 
efficiently is valid technique. 

The optimum is purely personal affinity brought about by understanding and 
communication with the preclear on agreeable subjects. Another and almost useless method is 
narcosynthesis together with the vanous drugs and hypnotics used to produce sleep. Methods can 
be found such as faith healing, books on 

medical hypnosis, the techniques of Indian medicine men and so forth. It is pointless to 
delineate these methods here. They are currently available under the name of hypnotism but a 
caution should be enjoined that hypnosis as itself is not at all acceptable to Dianetics and indeed 
has extremely limited use. Briefly, however, it must be remarked that if hypnotism is studied to 
advance these techniques, all positive suggestion and post-hypnotic suggestion must be avoided 
as these suggestions depend for their effectiveness upon the already existing content of the 
reactive mind and will only form additional locks. 

Any and all so-called hypnotic drugs have definite drawbacks since they, like so many 
other things, may be termed “shot-gun” methods. These paralyze not only the analytical mind but 
the remainder of the organism so that it is nearly impossible to obtain the proper somatic reaction 
in the preclear. They are not anesthetics but anesthesias. By using them the auditor instantly 
denies himself the main material which will lead him to the engram, which is to say, restimulated 
physical pain. Such restimulated pain is never of very great magnitude and is obliterated by the 
use of anesthesias. 

At no time should the auditor permit the preclear to be under the delusion that he is being 
hypnotized. This is mentioned because hypnotism is a current fad and the principles of Dianetics 
have nothing whatever to do with hypnotism. Both are based upon simple natural laws but have 
between them an enormous gulf. One is the tool of the charlatan and the other is the science of the 
human mind. 

Regression in its simplest form, hereafter called return, is employed in dianetic 
auditing.17 It would be an extraordinary case which required revivification. Return is the method 
of retaining the body and the awareness of the subject in present time while he is told to go back 
to a certain incident. Dates are not mentioned. His size is not mentioned. Various means are used 
to restimulate his memory. Any of the perceptics may be employed to return him to some period 

of his past. He is told simply to “go back to the time when .” He is asked to recount what 

he can of the incident. He is told that he is “right there” and that he can “recall this.” Little else is 
said by the auditor save those hints necessary to return the preclear to the proper time. 

The preclear is not allowed at any moment to revivify in that period since the data is 
drained as a surcharge from his time track to present time. He is told that he can remember this in 
present time since that will occasion the somatics to return to present time. Most of the data is 


27 



located by observing some somatic pain in the individual or some somatic aberration and seeking 
to discover wherein it was received. 

The somatics are employed primarily because the motor controls possess a less disturbed 
time track than the sensory strip. Anything which tends to lighten these somatics is then 
antipathetic to auditing. It must be remembered that there is no aberration without an 
accompanying somatic. The somatics alone, being physical ills of one sort or another, hold the 
aberrated content of the reactive mind in place. The motor controls can be returned to a period 
although the conscious or analytical mind believes itself to be entirely in present time. By talking 
to the muscles or motor controls or various bodily aches and pains, the auditor can shift them at 
will up and down their time track. This time track is not connected to the analytical mind and 
speech, but is apparently a parallel time track with greater reliability than the sensory track. The 
precision of data contained in the motor control time track is enormous. Muscles can be made to 
tense or relax. Coughs, aches, and pains can be made to come and go simply by uttering the right 
words for the engrams, or the wrong words. 

It is the primary task of the auditor to cause the time tracks of the motor strip and the 
sensory strip to come into parallel. That the time track exists in the strips has not been proven but 
they can so be considered for the purposes of this explanation. That they exist is extremely 
apparent. The motor strip time track can be asked questions down to the smallest moment of time, 
and the area of an engram can be so located and its character determined. 

As an analogy, a dream may be considered as the reception by the remaining analytical 
mind of a distortedly reflected and indirectly received picture of the engrams. This applies only 
when the dream is specifically directed at the reactive mind. It will be found that a preclear with a 
large and active reactive mind does not dream to any great extent in normal sleep but that a release 
may dream pleasantly and consistently. A dream in its normal function is that powerful and 
original mechanism called the imagination compositing or creating new pictures. 

The use of the dream is not highly technical and has little value in Dianetics. The auditor 
gleans data from the preclear by his own remarks about any subject, or by the preclear’s 
illogicalness on a subject. The auditor tells the preclear to dream about this data. When the 
preclear has had the dream he is directed to go back to the engram causing the dream. Quite often 
he will do so. If he does not, or if he becomes hostile, it is certain that an engram exists on the 
subject. 


The lie detector, the encephalograph and many other means are of limited usefulness in 
determining both the character and the extent of the engrams since into these as into the dreams 
can be fed the restimulators of the preclear. A codified restimulator list can be created which will 
be found to be common to most preclears. It should include all types of illnesses, accidents, the 
common trite phrases of the society, and names of various persons who commonly surround a 
child during his childhood. Such a codified restimulator list would be interesting for experiment 
and every auditor can compose his own. These are best composed after auditing the individual 
preclear and after inquiry into his life to determine the various irrationalities of thought. 

In that engrams are identity thought, the remarks of the preclear about his engrams will be 
found to be included in the content of those engrams. When the preclear is asked to imagine a bad 
situation at certain ages and under hypnotic conditions, he will very often deliver up a complete 
engram. The auditor must realize that every remark that a preclear makes while he is going over 
his reactive mind is probably some part of the content of that reactive mind. That mind is literal. 
The words the preclear uses when referring to it must be literally evaluated. 


28 



.c. DIAGNOSIS 


It is a useful and positive principle that whatever confronts or contests the analytical mind 
of the preclear will also confront and contest the analytical mind of the auditor. When the auditor 
is acting as the analytical mind of the preclear, whatever emotion or antagonism is directed 
towards him is the emotion or antagonism which is directed by the reactive mind toward the 
preclear’s own analytical mind. If a preclear cannot hear what people are saying in his engrams, 
he has another engram about “can’t hear.” If he cannot feel anything in his engram, it is because 
he has an engram about “can’t feel.” If he cannot see, he has an engram about not being able to 
see, and so forth. If he cannot return, he has an engram about going back, or returning to 
childhood, or some such thing. If he is doubtful and skeptical about what is happening or what 
has happened to him, it is because he has an engram about being doubtful and skeptical. If he is 
antagonistic, his reactive mind contains a great deal of antagonism. If he is self-conscious or 
embarrassed, it is because his reactive mind contains self-consciousness or embarrassment. If he 
insists on maintaining his own control, refusing to do what the auditor tells him to do (although 
he is returned), it is because he has an engram about self-control, and so forth and so on. This is 
identity thought, and is used in diagnosis. 

The return is the best method of learning the problems of the preclear. Trying to work the 
preclear into remembrance, hearing, seeing, feeling, going back and forward, going to sleep, 
awakening, and taking due notice of what he says about the entire process will form a rather 
complete diagnosis on one who is not insane. Questioning the preclear as to what is wrong with 
him while returned will elicit replies straight out of his principal engrams. Listening to an endless 
justification of his actions is both a delay and a waste of time but listening to what he has to say 
about what he thinks has happened to him or what he is afraid of is of definite value. 

The insane form and pose a slightly different problem but essentially the same. 

It is a clinically established observation that the reactive mind is relatively shallow. Below 
it lies the basic personality of the individual no matter how “insane” he may be. Therefore, by one 
means or another, a rational being may be reached within a person, a being which is not 
aberrated. It is this fact of non-aberration which makes the basic personality a difficult aid in 
diagnosis. Here however it can be established what the person really wants, what he hopes, what 
he actually feels. It has been observed that no matter what his raving state, providing his brain 
structure is normal and complete, the basic personality is entirely sound and sane and will 
cooperate. After auditing the person will become this strong, competent and able personality. 

The reactive mind, when unable to exert itself to its aberrated full in the environment of 
the person, will break the person, or cause him to lose tone. Therefore it is of definite interest to 
discover what immediately preceded the break of the preclear or what is currently causing him 
unhappiness. Something is dispersing his dynamics. The probability is that he has a chronic 
restimulator in his vicinity. Wives, husbands, mothers, fathers, superiors, etc., can be the source 
of such breaking since they turn the purpose of the reactive mind, which pretends to desire above 
all else the best interest of the person, back upon the person himself. Thus these sources cause the 
individual to lower back into the tone of the reactive mind, apathy, or a low tone two. 

The problem of the fixed person and the problem of the sympathy engram are both visible 
in the aberrated individual. The identity thought of the reactive mind has taken some part of the 
personality of some individual in the current environment and referred it to some part of the 
personality of an individual in the engramic past. The discovery of this identity is one of the 
principal problems in auditing. The sympathy engram is of a very specific nature, being the effort 
of the parent or guardian to be kind to a child who is severely hurt. If that parent or guardian has 
shown the child antagonism prior to the time of the injury, the adult (preclear) is prone to 


29 



reactivate the injury in the presence of the identity personality with whom he is now associated. 
This causes many somatic ills to present themselves in the present. Only the exact words of a 
sympathy engram will soothe the aberrated personality. 

There are not many personality types. A human being learns through mimicry. If his own 
self is found to be too painful he can become another self and very often does. A tone four can 
become another person at will without being aberrated about it, thus enjoying books and plays by 
“being” the person portrayed. But an aberrated individual can become part of the engramic cast of 
his reactive mind and so solve all of his problems in such an aberrated fashion. Aberrated persons 
are not themselves since they do not possess their own determinism. 

As has been stated, those emotions, doubts, worries and problems which confront the 
auditor when attempting to place the preclear in reverie or to work him in that reverie will lead the 
auditor into the basic content of the reactive mind. 

There are certain definite manifestations which can be suspected and certain routines 
which follow every case. Every human being has been carried in the womb and every human 
being has been born. The discovery of the basic engram on each chain is extremely important. 
Finding the basic engram is like taking the enemy in the flank. There is nothing before it, 
therefore the end most remote from the adult life of the individual is the end most exposed for the 
attack of the auditor. 

In the basic engram the preclear can see, feel, hear, and freely emote. When he is 
returned to later incidents, it may be found that he cannot do these things no matter how hard the 
auditor works to enable him to do so. By pursuing the engramic chain up its chronological 
sequence, this ability will be restored. Therefore it is necessary first and foremost to locate the 
basic engram. This may, in some few cases, lie later than birth. In the majority of the cases it will 
be found to lie at or before birth. No discussion is here entered about the ability of the human 
mind to remember at such remote periods. It can be stated however that when engramic data does 
exist, the time track is opened by pain and antagonism at these extreme points and can be 
contacted and exhausted. It is with the greatest difficulty that the auditor will find the basic 
engram. It is ordinarily quite painful, and since the scanning mechanism has as its purpose (or 
one of its purposes) the avoidance of pain, it will not easily reach them. Like the scanning 
mechanism on a cathode ray tube, the scanners of even a very reduced potential analytical mind 
sweep over, skipping and not touching the data on the engramic chain. By various means the 
auditor must then require the scanners to contact that data and force the data back onto the time 
track where it can be properly exhausted. 

Light prenatals are the best possible approach to a case. When the only prenatal is an 
extremely heavy one or an attempted abortion (which, by the way, are very common), the auditor 
must use a great deal of guile. It can be said that the basic engram and the beginning of the actual 
engram chains is very early, before, near, or during birth, is painful, and will not be easily 
contacted. In that few preclears have more than a few hundred serious engrams, the task is light 
when once begun but requires a great deal of imagination and persuasion. 

A prenatal must always be suspected unless birth, when lifted, rises easily into a tone 
four. If none of the engrams will rise into a tone four, the auditor would suppose that he has not 
discovered the basic. There are three kinds of engrams: the precursor, the engram and the 
follower. By engram here is meant that experience which the auditor has found and is working 
upon. If it does not seem to be lifting after a few recountings, a precursor (earlier engram) must 
be suspected and returned to. In this way an earlier basic may be discovered. Blows in the womb, 
attempted abortions, and birth are the usual basics. Easily the most important are the prenatals. 


30 



When a child is abnormally afraid of the dark, he probably has a severe engramic 
experience in prenatal. This prenatal experience will include all the sound data and sensory data of 
the incident. It is idiotic and identical. The preclear will have somatics. These on the first few 
recountings will be ordinarily faint and then become more severe as more data is located. The data 
will finally be in a more or less complete state and the engram will begin to lift, rising up through 
the various tones. All prenatals are apathy experiences and are therefore serious. Minor taps and 
discomforts in the womb are of no consequence. A true engram will consist of such a thing as a 
knitting needle being rammed through the foetus, half of the foetus’ head being badly injured, 
blows of various kinds bringing about foetal unconsciousness and so forth. Return eventually 
will find an opening into any period when there has been pain. 

Disbeliefs and antagonisms from the preclear on the subject of such a thing as an 
attempted abortion should be overlooked by the auditor or taken into account as the sign of an 
existing engram. A case is recalled wherein a girl insisted that if an abortion had ever been 
attempted on her it should have been successful. Through several sessions, while an attempt was 
made to lift birth, she continued this assertion until the auditor realized that this was probably a 
remark made by the abortionist (or the mother) when his efforts failed. As soon as this was 
suggested to the girl she was able to contact the actual incident. A chronic apathy case under 
treatment for some years in an institution, she suddenly responded to auditing, brought the 
abortion to tone four, erased birth to tone four and recovered mentally and physically into a social 
asset well above normal. 

The auditor should continue to suspect prenatals as long as he cannot get later engrams 
easily into tone four. Once an engramic chain has been lifted at its end nearest to conception, the 
preclear should begin to release relatively automatically, aided but little by the auditor. The erasure 
should be in terms of laughter at its optimum. This laughter is the reversing of charges residual in 
the locks which depended for their fear content or antagonistic content upon the basic engrams. 

Abortion attempts are easy to recognize when an auditor has had some experience. The 
parent who attempted the abortion will, after the child’s birth, likely be a source of anxiety to the 
individual who seems to require a great deal of affection and attraction from that parent. The 
individual will be found to be most fond of the parent (or other) who did not aid, or who actually 
tried to prevent the abortion attempt. At this time abortion attempts are extremely common. When 
an abortion attempt has been lifted, the engramic chain should easily be brought to the time track 
and exhausted. 

Auditing is essentially very simple but it demands precise understanding of the principles 
involved and imagination and sympathy on the part of the auditor. He must learn to compute 
engramically — or learn to think with his analytical mind, only for the purposes of auditing others, 
engramically. His biggest problem is the discovery of the basic of basics. It may elude him for a 
considerable period of time. 

There is, however, preparatory work to do in a case other than the discovery of the basic. 
Occasionally an entire time track must be rehabilitated in which “do not remember” and “can’t 
remember” have obscured the track. Later locks can be found and exhausted in the same manner 
that engrams are exhausted, and rapid scanning methods may be developed in the future for these. 
The hysteria or fear of the individual can be momentarily allayed one way or the other and the 
problem of reaching the basic can be entered upon. There are as many types of case as there are 
cases, but these are the primary fundamentals. 

An auditor must think his way through every case, taking as his data the constantly 
reiterated statements of the preclear during auditing, and accumulating experience as to how 
incidents can be thrust off the time track, burying them from sight by the analytical mind, thus 
forming a reactive mind to the detriment of the organism. 


31 



.c.EXHAUSTION OF ENGRAMS 


The technique of exhausting an engram is not complicated but it must be adhered to. An 
engram is an unconscious moment containing physical pain and conceived or actual antagonism to 
the organism. Therefore, that engram before it is discovered will exhibit antagonism toward the 
auditor trying to discover it. When it is first discovered, it may be found to be lacking in its 
essential data. There are many techniques by which this data can be developed. In a prenatal 
engram the analytical mind apparently must redevelop the situation. Many returns through the 
incident are therefore necessary. 

When an engram will not exhaust, the first thing the auditor should suspect is an earlier 
engram. It is actually possible for a later one to contain essential information which will not permit 
the information to rise. In the course of auditing, when an engram is restimulated by the auditor 
but will not rise above apathy and does not seem to contain all the necessary data, the auditor must 
look for an earlier engram, and it almost inevitably will be found to exist. This precursor is then 
developed as the basic engram. If it follows the same behavior pattern of not lifting or becoming 
complete, another previous to it must be discovered. If at last the auditor is entirely certain that 
there is no engram ahead of the one being run, some possible locking mechanism later on may be 
found and exhausted, at which time the basic may show itself. Continual application of energy to 
the basic will at length bring it into full view and continual recounting of it will gradually develop 
it, raise its tone and lift it into tone four. 

The principle of recounting is very simple. The preclear is merely told to go back to the 
beginning and to tell it all over again. He does this many times. As he does it the engram should 
lift in tone on each recounting. It may lose some of its data and gain other. If the preclear is 
recounting in the same words time after time, it is certain that he is playing a memory record of 
what he has told you before. He must then be sent immediately back to the actual engram and the 
somatics of it restimulated. He will then be found to somewhat vary his story. He must be 
returned to the consciousness of somatics continually until these are fully developed, begin to 
lighten and are then gone. Tone four will appear shortly afterwards. If the preclear is bored with 
the incident and refuses to go on with it, there is either an earlier engram or there is other data in 
the engram which has not been located. 

The auditor will discover that occasionally an engram when lifted into a three, or even 
erased, without reaching laughter, will sag. This is a certain sign of an earlier basic on that chain. 
Any kind of sag from a tone four is impossible if tone four has truly been reached. 

Tone four will not be reached if there are earlier basics. The engram may vanish and be 
erased, but there will be no cheerfulness or laughter about it at the end if it is not the basic. 

Once the basic has been reached and brought into tone four, it will disappear. The next 
engram on the chain will be located and rather easily brought into tone four. If one is accidentally 
skipped, the third in line will be found to hold or sag. The intermediate must then be located and 
brought into a tone four. In such a way the chain will gradually come up into a complete tone 
four. At this time the locks, the merely mentally painful incidents in the person’s life, will begin to 
release automatically. These will erase or lift without any attention from the auditor. While these 
are releasing, the auditor must concern himself with secondary engrarns. These would be 
engrams on their own if they had not had forerunners. They therefore do not relieve after the 
removal of the basic but must be located as themselves. These in turn will start a chain of 
releasing locks which again need no attention. There may be entirely distinct engramic chains in 
the reactive mind which are not appended in any way to the original basic. 


32 



So long as a preclear retains any part of a reactive mind, he will be interested in himself 
(in the condition of his mind) and be introverted. Therefore, so long as he is interested in his own 
reactive mind, he is impeded in his dynamic pursuit of survival. A guarantee of a tone four is the 
patient’ s interest in positive action along his dynamics, and his application of himself to the world 
around him. Introversion is not natural nor is it necessary to the creation of anything. It is a 
manifestation of the analytical mind trying to solve problems on improper data, and observing the 
organism being engaged in activities which are not conducive to survival along the dynamics. 
When a Clear has been reached, the basic personality and self-determinism of the individual will 
have asserted itself. No chronic somatics in the present will remain (excepting those which can be 
accounted for by actual disease, injury or malconstruction of the brain). 

Though more germane to Child Dianetics, it is of help to the auditor to know that a child 
can be considered to have formed his general basic purpose in life somewhere around the age of 
two. This purpose is fairly reliable, as at that time his engrams have probably not gained much 
force over him since his responsibilities are slight. He will have tried to hold his main purpose 
throughout his life but it will undoubtedly have been warped both by his reactive mind’s 
experience content and by his environment. The time when the purpose is formed varies and may 
indeed never have been manifested, as in the case of amentia. As the preclear is normally 
interested in this purpose and its rehabilitation, he will often take a more intense interest in 
auditing if there is an attempt made to discover it. This purpose is quite valid and the preclear can 
be expected to rehabilitate his life along its dictates unless he is too oppressed by his environment. 
(It can be remarked that a Release or Clear will ordinarily order or change his environment. ) 

Vocational therapies have as their source the tenet of the rehabilitation of the general 
purpose of an individual or the establishment of a false purpose in order to allay the activity of his 
reactive mind. It has little bearing on Dianetics, but an auditor, for the term of auditing may 
engage his preclear along the purpose line of becoming a Clear. This is not necessary and is 
indeed often automatic since the basic personality beholds at last a chance to manifest itself. 
However, it will occasionally aid the auditor. 

The auditor should be prepared to have to solve many individual problems since above 
the basics are almost as many problems as there are cases. For example, in the case of a preclear 
who has several very nasty prenatals it will be found that the formation of the body in the womb 
has overlaid or confused the time track so that a later prenatal must be partially lifted before an 
earlier prenatal can be exhausted. This is often true of a later period of life. In one case an entire 
series of prenatals was held down by a dental operation under nitrous oxide at the age of 
twenty-five. Until some portion of this was removed, the bulk of the prenatals were not available. 
In short, the circuits of the mind can become entangled to a point where even the motor control 
time track is confused. 

Dispersal of purpose by some engram along some dynamic or purpose line is a common 
situation and is indeed the basic concept. As a stream of electrons would behave if they were to 
encounter a solid object in their path, so does a drive or purpose disperse. These many varied and 
faint tracks after impact with the engram are symptomatic. Along dynamic two, the sexual drive, 
promiscuity inevitably and invariably indicates a sexual engram of great magnitude. Once that 
engram is removed promiscuity can be expected to cease. 

Anxiety is established in the preclear’ s mind by such dispersals and he dramatizes 
because of the dispersal. This is one of the manifestations of his malady. No pervert ever became 
a pervert without having been educated or abused by a pervert. And that abuse must have been 
very thorough. The contagion of engrams is an interesting manifestation which the auditor should 
and must observe. It can be said that insanity runs in families, not because this is a eugenic truth 
but because a standard patter during emergencies or stress creates certain types of engrams which 
in turn create types of insanities. Insanities are so definitely contagious that when a child is raised 


33 



by aberrated parents, the child becomes aberrated. As would be delineated by Child Dianetics, the 
best way to guarantee a sane child is to provide it with cleared or released parents. This is of 
definite interest to the auditor since he will discover that in cases of severe prenatals and birth the 
engrams were also received by the mother exactly as they were received by the child. The child 
will thereafter be a restimulator to the mother and the mother a restimulator to the child for the 
severe incidents. The mother, having received the exact wording of the engram, also contains the 
engram. Restimulation by the child will occasion the use of the engramic language toward the 
child. This brings the infant and child and adolescent into the unhappy situation of having his 
birth engram or his prenatal engrams continually restimulated. This occasions dire results and 
very great unhappiness in the home and is one of the main sources of family difficulties. 

A child, even if he despises them, will dramatize the actions of his parents when he 
himself is married and when he himself has children. In addition to this the other partner in the 
marriage also has his or her own engrams. Their engrams combine into doubled engrams in the 
children. The result of this is a contagion and a progression of aberration. Thus any society which 
does not have a high purpose finds itself declining and gaining greater numbers of insane. The 
contagion of aberration is at work progressively, and the children become progressively aberrated 
until at last the society itself is aberrated. 

While the fate of society belongs definitely in Social and Political Dianetics, the auditor is 
interested in the fact that he can take the prenatal and birth content of the engrams of his preclear 
and run them to discover post-birth locks and secondary engrams. The mother will normally have 
used much the same data whenever the troubles of the child impinged upon her reactive mind; this 
of course accounts for the locks. 

The auditor will also discover that where he has a married preclear who is aberrated, he 
should have two preclears, which is to say, the partner. It is useless to return a preclear to his or 
her aberrated spouse and expect domestic tranquility to result. While the release cannot and will 
not pick up his old engrams from the spouse in whom he has implanted them, he will, never- 
theless, find his life made unbearable by the mere existence of a spouse that he himself may have 
aberrated. 

Further, the children of these people will also need auditing, since they will be found (if 
the parent’s aberrations were of any magnitude) to be sickly or aberrated or deficient in some 
way. The auditor should therefore, when he undertakes a case, be prepared to audit the family of 
his preclear, should an investigation of that preclear make it seem necessary. 

Aberrations are contagious and where a person has been aberrated, his environment will 
to some degree also have become aberrated. The preclear may, for one thing, be somewhat 
victimized and impeded by his reactive mind which is now existing in his associates. 

The auditor should not permit such terms as “psychoneurotic,” “crazy,” or “mentally 
exhausted” to exist for long in the preclear’ s mind. These are depressive and are actually 
aberrations in the society. It is true and provable that the preclear is on his way to being, not a 
person who is crazy or neurotic, but an individual who will have more stability and self-command 
and ability, possibly, than those around him. To be blunt: this is not the process of reviving 
corpses into a semblance of life. It is a process which, at its best usage, is taking the “normal” and 
“average” and giving them their birthright of happiness and creative attainment in the world of 
man. 


34 



.c.ENGRAM CHAINS 


More than one engramic chain will be found in every aberree. When this person becomes 
a preclear the dianeticist does well to discover the earliest chain. It is not always possible to do 
this with accuracy since apreclearis sometimes in such a nervous condition that he cannot be 
worked on his basic chain but must be alleviated in a greater or lesser degree by the exhaustion of 
a later and more available chain. This last, however, is not the usual case. 

The dianeticist should clearly understand certain working principles and definitions. By 
an engram is meant a moment of unconsciousness accompanied by physical pain and conceived 
antagonism. The basic engram is the earliest engram on an engram chain. Also there may be 
engrams of the same character and kind on the same drive line as the basic engram of the chain. 
An engram chain is composed of a basic engram and a series of similar incidents. Engram chains 
also contain locks which are instances of mental anguish more or less known to the analytical 
mind. These are often mistaken by the preclear for the cause of his conduct. A true engram is 
unknown to the conscious computer of the preclear but underlies it as a false datum on which are 
erected almost equally unknown similar incidents and an enormous number of locks. 

In order to release an engram chain it is vital and absolutely necessary to discover the 
basic of that chain. An individual will have more than one engram chain but he has a basic chain. 
This must be released as soon as possible after auditing is begun on the preclear. 

When an engram is discovered by the dianeticist, he must examine the aspect of it to 
determine whether or not it is the basic. Discovering it is not, he must immediately determine an 
earlier basic, and so forth until he is obviously on the scene of the basic engram. 

There are certain tests which he can apply. A basic engram will rise to laughter, “sag” 
slightly, and then rise to tone four and vanish. Successive engrams will then erase from that chain 
with very little work. Almost any engram on an engram chain can be exhausted, but if it is not a 
basic engram it will recede and vanish at times but will rise in part again when the basic engram 
has been reached and the preclear is brought forward into its area. 

An engram not basic is subject to “sag.” Which is to say that it may be brought to the two 
point zero (2.0) tone, but after a certain length of time has elapsed — from one to two days — it 
will be found to have “sagged” and to be, for instance, in a one point one (1.1) tone. It can be 
successively lifted until it is apparently in a three point zero (3.0) tone, at which point much of its 
content will disappear. This is reduction. 

Any engram chain can be reduced to some degree without reaching the basic but when it 
has been reached the basic itself and subsequent engrams can be brought rapidly to tone four 
providing no engrams are skipped on the return up the time track. 

When an engram chain has been brought to tone four, it can be considered to have 
vanished. The preclear can no longer find it on the time track (he may even be unable to recall 
some of its most painful and disheartening aspects). The mind apparently has been proofed 
against the data it has contained. A search for an engram chain after it has been exhausted and a 
tone four has been achieved should, for purposes of auditing, be entirely fruitless. 

Once the basic has been discovered and the engram chain has been brought to tone four 
the locks will vanish of their own accord. If this does not occur then there is something remaining 
or the auditor has been too optimistic about the selection of his basic engram for the chain and has 
not, in reality, discovered it. 


35 



All engram chains should be exhausted from a preclear. These may be discovered to lie 
along the various dynamics but any chain may influence more than one dynamic. 

Another type of engram is the cross engram. This is usually a childhood or adult engram 
which embraces more than one engram chain. The receipt of the cross engram, containing as it 
does the convergence of two or more engram chains, is often accompanied by a “nervous 
breakdown” or the sudden insanity of an individual. A cross engram may occur in a severe 
accident, in prolonged or severe illness under antagonistic circumstances, or a nitrous oxide 
operation. Cross engrams are very easy to locate but should not be addressed by the dianeticist as 
such since an enormous amount of work upon them will not exhaust them until the basic and the 
chains on which the cross engram depends have been brought to tone four. 

Post-battle neurasthenia is almost always traceable to the receipt of a cross engram. This 
must be, of course, an engram in its own right on more than one chain. It is conceivable that it 
may be so severe that it “breaks” the individual even if it lies on only one chain. 

There are certain rules the dianeticist may employ to establish the basic engram of a chain. 
In first entering a case these rules apply as well to the first goal which is the location of the basic 
engram of the basic chain. 

Number one: No engram will lift if the basic of that chain has not been lifted. 

Number two: The basic engram will not lift until the basic instant of the basic engram has 
been reached, which is to say, the first moment of the engram. Ordinarily this is the most 
obscure. 


Number three: If after two or three test recountings of an engram it does not seem to be 
improving, the auditor should attempt to discover an earlier engram. 

Number four: No engram is valid unless accompanied by somatic pain. This may be 
mild. Incidents which do not contain somatics are either not basic (the chain having been 
suspended by some such command as “can’t feel” in the basic) or else it may not even be an 
engram. 

Cases should be entered as near as possible to the basic engram. Then they should be 
returned to earlier incidents until the basic is discovered. 

The running of locks themselves may accomplish some alleviation of a case. 


36 



.c. PRENATAL, BIRTH AND INFANT ENGRAMS 


The human mind and the human anatomy are enormously more powerful and resilient 
than has commonly been supposed. Only incidents of the greatest magnitude in physical pain and 
hostile content are sufficient to aberrate a mind. 

The ability of the mind to store data can scarcely be overrated. In early life before sound 
is analyzed as speech a human being receives and stores exact impressions of everything which 
occurs. At some future date, when similar perceptics are encountered, the reactive mind 
re-analyzes — on the basis of identities only — the content of the early mind. This becomes the 
foundation of the post-conception personality. The actual personality in the individual is powerful 
and very difficult to aberrate. Unlike animals which can be driven mad by minor mechanisms of 
experimental psychology, a man must be most severely handled before he begins to show any 
signs of derangement. That derangement proceeds from the ability of the reactive mind to store 
perceptions from the earliest moments of existence and retain them on either the analytical or the 
reactive plane for future reference. 

The basic personality does not proceed from engrams, and the dynamics of the individual 
are impeded not enhanced by engrams. The dynamics are entirely separate and are as native to the 
individual as his basic personality, of which they are a part. 

Information falls into two categories: the educational or experience level, banked and 
available to the analytical mind on at least its deeper levels; and aberrational, or data stored in the 
reactive mind and often used but never reached by the analytical mind, save through auditing. 
There would seem to be two types of recording. The first is cellular recording in which the cells 
would seem to store data. In that cells in procreating become themselves again — which is to say 
that when cell A divides, both halves are still cell A — cellular intelligence is not lost. Personal 
identity is duplicated. In the case of individual men, procreation is far more complex and 
individual identity is lost — the son is not the father but a genetic composite of vast numbers of 
ancestors. 

The cells of the human being shortly after conception are capable of enormous perceptic 
and retentive power. After a very short time in the womb, the brain and nervous system are 
already operating. From then until birth the human being is apparently capable of computations of 
a rather complex nature on the analytical mind level. Far more certainly he retains information on 
the reactive level. 

Fear, pain, and unconsciousness extend the range of perception of the individual. When 
the human being in the womb is injured his senses extend so as to record sounds outside the 
mother’s body. He records them so well that their precise nature is stored for future reference. 
The human being in the womb responds exactly as it does after birth to the receipt of engrams, 
storing the data with precision and reacting to it. 

The repair facilities available to a human being before birth are greatly enhanced by the 
presence of ample connective tissue, oxygen and sustenance. These repair facilities are 
unimaginably great so that a prenatal human being can be severely torn and ripped without 
becoming structurally deficient. It does, however, receive engrams and these are subject to 
restimulation. In many cases of attempted abortions it was found that large sections of the prenatal 
human being’s brain could apparently be injured without the brain being deficient or even scarred 
after birth. These repair facilities do not however lessen the extreme severity of the engrams 
which can be received by the prenatal human being. The word foetus is dropped at this point and 
it is advised that it should be dropped from the language as a description of a pre-birth human 
being. Insufficient evidence is at hand to make an outright declaration that attempted abortions are 


37 



responsible for the bulk of our criminal and insane aberrees. But according to the cases at hand 
the attempted abortion must be accounted responsible for the majority. 

The attempted abortion is the most serious aberration producer. So exact is the recording 
of the pre-birth human being that the reactive mind makes no errors in recognizing its enemies 
after birth. The mind becomes aberrated in having to depend upon these same enemies for the 
ordinary sustenance of life while the child is a helpless infant. The diagnosis of a prenatal case is 
relatively simple. Nearly all preclears will be found to have at least one prenatal engram and the 
case will not solve unless that prenatal is reached and exhausted. 

The dianeticist can usually establish the attempted abortion preclear by an investigation of 
the conduct of the infant and child. Uneasiness or unhappiness in the home, a feeling of not being 
wanted, unreasonable fear, and a strong attachment to grandparents or another non-parental 
member of the household are often signs of an attempted abortion. Fear of the dark is usually but 
not always a part of the attempted abortion case. The auditor should suspect an abortion attempt in 
every preclear he audits, at least for this next generation. Whether or not the preclear disbelieves 
the diagnosis is of no importance to the auditor as the prenatal engrams may very well contain the 
words, “Can’t believe it.” The parents themselves, as well as society, mislead the individual as to 
the enormous prevalence of this practice at this time. The attempted abortion preclear may not be 
discovered to be such until considerable auditing has already been done. Any auditing done on an 
attempted abortion preclear, unless it is solely addressed to making the case workable, is wasted 
until the attempted abortions are reached. 

The post-birth aberree presents a somewhat different case than the prenatal since his case 
can be entered at any point and the earliest moments of it can be attained easily. This is not true of 
the attempted abortion preclear. Attempted abortions may run to any number. Since they are easily 
the most prevalent dramatization of engrams in the society, they are repeated time and again. The 
auditor will find it necessary to “unstack” the prenatal period. He will ordinarily reach the latest 
prenatal injury first. As he finds and examines it, it places itself on the time track. By going to 
earlier and earlier attempts, more and more of these engrams are revealed until at last the earliest is 
discovered. The auditor must be prepared to spend many hours of hard work in unstacking 
injuries. He will many times believe that he has reached the basic of that engram chain only to 
discover that another type of abortion was attempted prior to that moment. He need not address 
these engrams for any length of time before he goes on to the earlier one. He should only get 
some idea of them so that they will be easily locatable on the return. The basic engram on the 
attempted abortion case may be found shortly after the first missed period of the mother. 

Its emotion will be exactly that of the person or persons attempting to perform the 
abortion. The prenatal human being identifies himself with himself but an adult returned to the 
prenatal period is reinterpreting the data and will find that he has and is confusing himself with 
other people associated in the attempts. This engramic data may have slumbered for years before it 
became violently restimulated and may indeed never have been awakened. It must be removed, 
however, before a release can be obtained. The auditor should be prepared to unstack fifty or 
more incidents before birth if necessary. 

When he is at last in the vicinity of the basic, even the most skeptical preclear (one who 
has skepticism as part of the prenatal engram chains) will have no further question as to what is 
happening to him. The auditor should be prepared to encounter difficulty in the ability of the 
preclear to hear voices or feel pain, as it is quite common for the engramic content to contain such 
phrases as “Unconscious” and “Can’t see, can’t feel, can’t hear,” this having been the 
misconception of the society regarding prenatal life. 

The auditor should never be appalled at the damage the prenatal human being has received 
and so question the validity of his preclear’ s data. Unless the umbilical cord is severed or the heart 


38 



is stopped it is apparently the case that no damage, particularly in the earlier months, is too great 
for the organism to reconstruct. In that parents performing abortions are usually dramatizing 
attempted abortions which have been performed on them, rationality of content in the engrams 
should not be expected. Even the data given for it by the abortionist father, mother or professional 
is often entirely inaccurate. 

The test of an engram is whether or not it will lift and whether or not the somatics which 
accompanied it disappear and a tone four is obtained. Rearranging data into other sequences will 
not obtain this. The exact content must be brought out. The attempted abortion human being is 
often struck unconscious by the earliest part of each attempt since the head is so available to the 
knitting needles, hat pins, orange-wood sticks, buttonhooks, and so forth which are employed. 
These periods of unconsciousness must be penetrated and will quite ordinarily release slowly. 

The number of prenatal engrams should not particularly appall the auditor for when the 
basic has been discovered and a tone four achieved, the succeeding experiences will lift with 
greater and greater ease. The periods of consciousness interspersed between the prenatal engrams, 
being locks, will vanish. 

Birth is in itself a severe experience and is recorded by the human being from the first 
moments of pain throughout the entire experience. Everything in a birth is engramic since the 
human being conceives the ministrations to be more or less antagonistic when they are 
accompanied by so much pain. A birth must be lifted as a matter of course but not until the 
presence or absence of prenatals has been established. Even after birth has been lifted, prenatals 
should be looked for, since prenatals may often be found only after birth has been exhausted. The 
habits of obstetricians, the presence of sound and speech in the delivery room, the swabbing of an 
infant’s nostrils, the examination of its mouth, the severe treatment administered to start its 
breathing and the drops on the eyes may account in themselves for many psychosomatic ills. A 
cough, however, although it is present in birth and seems to be alleviated by the exhaustion of the 
birth engram, is quite ordinarily blood running down the throat of the prenatal during an attempted 
abortion. Any perception during birth, when difficulty is encountered with breathing, may 
become a restimulator for asthma. Clean fresh air and electric lights may cause allergies and may 
be the principal restimulators. Everything said during birth, as well as everything said during 
prenatal experiences, is recorded in the reactive mind and acts as aberrational matter which can 
and does cause psychological and physiological changes in the individual. Because the parents are 
not greatly in evidence at birth, this experience may not be restimulated for many years. Prenatals, 
on the other hand, restimulate more easily. 

Infant life is very sentient. Delay in learning to talk is delay in learning the complexity of 
handling vocal muscles rather than an inability to record. Everything in infant life is recorded and 
the engrams received in it are extremely valid. 

The auditor will find himself dealing mainly with prenatal, birth, and infant life. The 
cases are very rare which have many important basics in childhood or adult life. These last 
periods contain mainly other engrams which, though they must be addressed to create the release, 
should not engage much initial attention on the part of the dianeticist. Most of the experiences of 
mental anguish in childhood and adult life are founded on very early engrams and are locks which 
are almost self-removing. 

Moments of unconsciousness which contain physical pain and conceived antagonism 
lying in childhood and adult life are serious and can produce aberration. Engram chains complete 
with basic may be found which will, all by themselves, exhaust. 


39 



.c.THE “LAWS” OF RETURNING 


By aberration is meant the aberree’s reactions to and difficulties with his current 
environment. 

By somatic is meant any physical or physically sensory abnormality which the preclear 
manifests generally or sporadically in his environment, or any such manifestation encountered and 
re -experienced during auditing. 

The aberration is the mental error caused by engrams and the somatic is the physical error 
occasioned by the same source. 

The auditor follows the general rule that no aberrations or somatics exist in a subject 
which cannot be accounted for by engrams. He may ordinarily be expected to discover that 
anything which reduces the physical or mental perfection of the subject is engramic. He applies 
this rule first and in practice admits no organic trouble of any character. Only when he has 
obviously obtained a Clear and when he has observed and has had that Clear medically examined 
after a period of sixty days to six months from the end of auditing should he be content to assign 
anything to organic origin. He cannot be expected to know until the final examination exactly 
what somatic was not engramic. In other words he must persistently adhere to one line of thought 
(that the preclear can be brought to mental and physical perfection) before he resigns any mental 
or physical error in the preclear to a purely organic category. Too little is known at this writing of 
the recoverability of the mind and body for a dianeticist to deny that ability to recover. Since 
primary research, considerable practice has demonstrated that this ability to reconstruct and 
recover is enormous, far beyond anything previously conceived possible. 

Dianetics accounts for all faith healing phenomena on an entirely scientific basis and the 
dianeticist can expect himself to consort daily in his practice with what appear to be miracles. 

In addition to knowledge of his subject, considerable intelligence and imagination, and a 
personality which inspires confidence, the dianetic auditor must possess persistency to a 
remarkable degree. In other words, his drives must be phenomenally high. There is no substitute 
for the auditor’s having been cleared. It is possible for an individual to operate with Dianetics 
without having been released and he may do so for some time without repercussion, but as he 
audits he will most certainly encounter the perceptics contained in sorVe of his own engrams time 
after time until these engrams are so restimulated that he will become mentally or physically ill. 

In psychoanalysis it was possible for the analyst to escape this fate because he dealt 
primarily with locks occurring in the post-speech life. The analyst might even experience relief 
from operating on patients since it might clarify his own locks which always had been more or 
less completely available to his analytical mind. This is very far from the case with the dianeticist 
who handles continually the vital and highly charged data which cause physical and mental 
aberrations. An auditor in Dianetics may work with impunity for a very short time only before his 
own condition demands that he himself be audited. While this is aside from the main subject of 
auditing, it has been too often observed to be neglected. 

Every engram possesses some quality which denies it to the analytical mind. There are 
several types. First there is the “denyer” engram which contains the species of phrase, “Frank will 
never know about this,” “Forget it!” “Cannot remember it!” and so forth. Second is the 
self-invalidating engram which contains the phrases, “Never happened,” “Can’t believe it,” 
“Wouldn’t possibly imagine it,” and so on. 


40 



Third is the “bouncer” engram which contains the species of phrase, “Can’t stay here,” 
“Get out!” and other phrases which will not permit the preclear to remain in its vicinity but return 
him to present time. A fourth is the “holder” engram which contains “Stay here,” “Hold still,” 
“Can’t get out,” and so on. 

These are four of the general types which the dianeticist will find occasion him the 
greatest difficulty. The type of phrase being encountered, however, is easily diagnosed from 
preclear reaction. 

There are many other types of engrams and phrases which will be encountered. There is 
the self-perpetuating engram which implies that, “It will always be this way,” and “It happens all 
the time.” The auditor will soon learn to recognize them, forming lists of his own. 

An engram would not be an engram unless it had strong compulsive or repressive data 
contained in it. All engrams are self-locking to some degree, being well off the time track and 
touching it slightly, if at all, with some minor and apparently innocuous bit of information which 
the analytical mind disregards as unimportant. Classed with the denyer variety are those phrases 
which deny perception of any kind. The dianetic auditor will continually encounter perception 
denial and will find it one of the primary reasons the preclear cannot recall and articulate the 
engram. “Can’t see,” “Can’t hear,” “Can’t feel,” and “Isn’t alive” tend to deny the whole engram 
containing any such phrases. 

As the engram is a powerful surcharge of physical pain, it will without any phrases 
whatsoever deny itself to the analytical mind which, in seeking to scan the engram, is repelled by 
the operating principle that it must avoid pain for the organism. As has already been covered, 
there are five ways the organism can handle a source of pain. It can neglect it, attack it, succumb 
to it, flee from it, or avoid it. As the entire organism handles exterior pain sources, so does the 
analytical mind tend to react to engrams. There is an exterior world reaction of the organism to 
pain sources then. This is approximated when the analytical mind is addressed in regard to 
engrams. There is an excellent reason for this. Everything contained in the reactive mind is 
exterior source material. The analytical mind went out of circuit and was recording imperfectly if 
at all in the time period when the exterior source was entered into the reactive mind. 

An analytical mind when asked to approach an engram reacts as it would have had it been 
present, which is to say, in circuit, at the moment when the engram was being received. 
Therefore, an artificial approach to the engram must be made which will pemmit the auditor to 
direct the subject’s analytical mind into but one source of action: Attack. 

The actual incident must be located and re-experienced. In that the analytical mind has 
five possible ways of reacting to the engram and in that the auditor desires that only one of 
these — attack — be used, the preclear must be persuaded from using the remaining four. 

On this general principle can be created many types of approach to the problem of 
obtaining a Clear. The one which is offered in this manual is that one which has met with quicker 
and more predictable results than others researched at this time. It has given, in use, one hundred 
per cent results. In the beginning, at this time, an auditor should not attempt to stray far from this 
offered technique. He should attempt to vary it only when he himself has had extensive and 
sufficient practice which will enable him to be very conversant with the nature of engrams. Better 
techniques will undoubtedly be established which will provide swifter exhaustion of the reactive 
mind. The offered technique has produced results in all types of cases so far encountered. 

There are three equations which demonstrate how and why the auditor and preclear can 
reach engrams and exhaust them: 


41 



I. The auditor’s dynamics are equal to or less than the engramic surcharge in the preclear. 

II. The preclear’ s dynamics are less than the engramic surcharge. 

III. The auditor’s dynamics plus the preclear’ s dynamics are greater than the engramic 
surcharge. 

When the preclear’s dynamics are entirely or almost entirely reduced, as in the case of 
amnesia trance, drug trances and so forth, the auditor’s dynamics are not always sufficient to 
force the preclear’ s analytical mind into an attack upon the engram. 

The auditor’s dynamics directed against an engram in a preclear who has not been 
subjected to a process which will inhibit the free play of his reactive mind and concentrate it, 
ordinarily provokes the preclear into one of the four unusable methods of succumbing, fleeing, 
avoiding or neglecting the engram. Demanding that the preclear “face reality,” or “see reason,” or 
that he “stop his foolish actions” falls precisely into this category. The auditor’s dynamics 
operating against an awake preclear can produce an “insanity break,” temporary or of considerable 
duration in the preclear. 

When the preclear is in reverie some of his own dynamics are present and the auditor’s 
dynamics added to these make a combination sufficient to overcome the engramic surcharge. 

If the auditor releases his dynamics against the analytical mind of the preclear, which is to 
say, the person of the preclear, while an attempt is being made to reach an engram (in violation of 
the auditor’s code, or with some erroneous idea that the whole person of the preclear is 
confronting him) he will receive in return all the fury of the engramic surcharge. 

An engram can be dramatized innumerable times, for such is the character of the reactive 
mind that the surcharge of the engram cannot exhaust itself and will not exhaust itself regardless 
of its age or the number of times dramatized until it has been approached by the analytical mind of 
the subject. 

The additive dynamic drive law must be made to apply before engrams are reached. It is 
occasionally very necessary to change dianetic auditors, for some preclears will work well only 
with either a male or a female auditor, or with one or another individual auditor. This will not be 
found necessary in many cases. Three cases are on record where the preclear was definitely anti- 
pathetic toward the auditor throughout the entire course of auditing. The dianeticist was found to 
be a restimulator for one or more of the persons contained in the engrams. Even so, these persons 
responded. Greater patience was required on the part of the auditor. Closer observance of the 
auditor’s code was necessary and a longer time was required for auditing. It will be discovered 
that once the preclear understands what is desired of him and why, his basic personality is 
aroused to the extent that it will cooperate with any auditor in order to be free. It will suffer 
through many violations of the auditor’s code. Once a preclear has started his auditing he will 
ordinarily continue to cooperate in the major requirements to the fullest extent, no matter what 
apparent antagonisms he may display in minor matters. 

Reverie is a method that has been used with success. The analytical mind of the preclear, 
while reduced in its potential and under direction, is still capable of thinking its own thoughts and 
forming its own opinions. Implicit obedience to whatever the auditor suggests is not desirable as 
the preclear will inject extraneous material at the faintest suggestion of the auditor. Drugs inhibit 
the somatic and have no use in entering a case. 


42 



The fact that the dianeticist is interested solely in what has been done to the preclear and is 
not at all interested in what the preclear himself has done to others greatly facilitates auditing since 
there is no social disgrace in having been an unwitting victim. 

In reverie the preclear is placed in a light state of “concentration” which is not to be 
confused with hypnosis. In the state of alliance, therefore, the mind of the preclear will be found 
to be, to some degree, detachable from his surroundings and directed interiorly. The first thing 
that the dianeticist will discover in most preclears is aberration of the sense of time. There are 
various ways that he can circumvent this and construct a time track along which he can cause the 
preclear’ s mind to travel. Various early experiences which are easily reached are examined and an 
early diagnosis can be formed. Then begins an immediate effort to reach basic, with attempted 
abortion or prenatal accident predominating. Failures on the first attempts to reach prenatal 
experiences should not discourage the dianetic auditor since many hours may be consumed and 
many false basics reached and exhausted before the true prenatal basic is attained. 

In this type of reverie the dianeticist can use and will observe certain apparently natural 
laws in force. They are as follows: The difficulties the analytical mind encounters when returned 
to or searching for an engram are identical to the command content of that engram . 

An aberree in adult life is more or less obeying, as restimulated, the composite 
experiences contained in his engrams. 

The preclear’ s behavior in reverie is regulated by the commands contained in the engram 
to which he is returned and is modifed by the composite of chronologically preceding engrams on 
his time track. 

The somatics of a preclear are at their highest in an engram where they were received and 
at the moment of reception in that experience. 

When returned to a point prior to an engram, the commands and somatics of that engram 
are not effective on the preclear. As he is returned to the moment of an engram, the preclear 
experiences, as the common denominator of all engrams, a considerable lessening of his analytical 
potential. He speaks and acts in a modified version of the engram. All complaints he makes to the 
auditor should be regarded as possibly being verbatim from, first, the engram that he is 
reexperiencing or, second, from prior engrams. 

At the precise moment of an engramic command the preclear experiences obedience to 
that command. The emotion a preclear experiences when regressed to an engram is identical to the 
emotional tone of that engram. Excesses of emotion will be found to be contained in the word 
content of the engram as commands. 

When a preclear is returned to before the moment of reception of an engram he is not 
subject to any part of that engram, emotionally, aberrationally, or somatically. 

When the time track is found to contain loops or is blurred in any portion, its crossings or 
confusions are directly attributable to engramic commands which precisely state the confusion. 

Any difficulty a preclear may experience with returning, reaching engrams, perceiving, or 
recounting, is directly and precisely commanded by engrams. 

An engram would not be an engram were it easy to reach, or if it gave the preclear no 
difficulty and contained no physical pain. 


43 



The characteristic of engrams is confusion. First, the confusion of the time track; second, 
the confusion of an engramic chain wherein similar words or somatics mix incidents; third, 
confusion of incidents with engrams. 

This confusion is occasioned by the disconnected state of the analytical mind during the 
receipt of the engram. Auditing by location and identification of hidden incidents, first rebuilds at 
least the early part of the time track, locates and fixes engrams in relation to one another in time, 
and then locates the basic of the basic chain and exhausts it. The remainder of the chain must also 
be exhausted. Other engrams and incidents exhaust with ease after the erasure of the basic or the 
basic of any chain (within that chain). Locks vanish without being located. A tone four gained on 
basic permits the subsequent erasure on the time track to go forward with ease. A whole chain 
may rise to four without the basic chain having been located. 

Any perception of pre-speech life during reverie denotes the existence of engramic 
experience as far back as the time track is open. 

If the individual’s general tone is clearly not tone four, if he is still interested in his 
engrams, another more basic chain than the one found still exists. 

Engramic patterns tend to form an avoidance pattern for the preclear. From basic outward 
there is an observable and progressive divergence between the person himself and his returned 
self. In the basic engram of the basic chain and for a few subsequent incidents on that chain, he 
will be found within and receiving the experiences as himself. In subsequent incidents cleavage is 
observable, and in late engrams the preclear is found to be observing the action from outside of 
himself, almost as a disinterested party. This forms the principal primary test for the basic of the 
basic chain. Another test for basic is “sag.” 

Any engram may be exhausted to a point where it will recede without reaching tone four. 
Although it is temporarily and momentarily lost to the individual and apparently does not trouble 
him, that engram which has been exhausted in a chain without the basic having been reached will 
“sag” or reappear within twenty-four to sixty hours. Basic on any chain will not “sag” but will lift 
on a number of recountings, rise to tone four and will remain erased. Another test for basic is 
whether or not it begins to lift with ease. If an engram does not intensify or remain static after 
many recountings, it can be conceived to be at least a basic on some chain. Locks will lift and 
disappear without returning as they are not fixed by physical pain. Large numbers of locks can be 
exhausted bringing an alleviation of the preclear’ s difficulties and such a course may occasionally 
be pursued in the entrance of a case. The discovery and lifting of the basic to which the locks are 
appended removes the locks automatically. 

These rules and laws even if modifed in their statement will be found invariable. 
Incompetent auditing cannot be excused by the supposed discovery of a special case or exception. 
A physical derangement must be in the category of actually missing parts of the organism which 
cause permanent disability, and instances of this are not common.

.c.CASE HISTORIES 


The following case histories have been selected at random. Due to lack of time, these case 
histories are Releases, not Clears. The Releases have been fully diagnosed and researched. 


CASE NO. 1 

HYPERTENSION, COMBAT FATIGUE 
TUBERCULOSIS, ARRESTED 

MYOPIC ASTIGMATISM 

A forty-three year old ex- Army officer and author; inclined to petty tyrannies; twice 
divorced; no children. Processed by army as psycho-neurotic. 

Birth was discovered immediately but would not satisfactorily release. The preclear 
experienced great difficulty in visualizing and his aberrations intensified during auditing. 

By use of dreams and restimulation of somatics the preclear was able to reach the 
beginning of the engramic chain as counted backwards from birth. Fifteen prenatal experiences 
were unstacked. They were found lying in two loops. The loops were corrected and the basic 
engram of the basic chain was reached. (A loop is a redoubling of the time track back on itself. In 
this case incidents are not in their correct place on the time track. ) 

The basic consisted of a severe quarrel between his mother and father with several 
abdominal blows being received by the mother. The mother was protesting that it would make her 
sick all of her life. At the same time the mother was coughing from a throat blow. The father was 
insisting that he was master in his own home and that people had to do what he told them. This 
quarrel occurred at about four and a half months after conception and resulted in the temporary 
paralysis of the preclear’s right side. The remainder of the chain consisted of similar incidents, 
evidently dramatizations on the part of the father of his own engrams, as the words used were 
almost identical, one engram to the next. This chain accounted for and relieved the subject’s fear 
that he would be ill and his desire to tyrannize others. 

Birth was then found to consist of near suffocation and considerable antagonism between 
the doctor and the nurse. This was registered as commands to himself to the effect that he was 
blind and could not see. Birth was in the home and dust, camphor, the smell of clean sheets and 
greased metal were the restimulators for this severe lung irritation. This birth was not restimulated 
until the age of five and the prenatals were not restimulated until entrance into the service when the 
need for authority manifested itself. 

No locks were found to need attention and only one half hour of his war experience failed 
to release, that being a new basic. 

Number of hours on case: fifty-five. 


CASE NO. 2 

APATHY, PRECLEAR HAD BEEN UNDER PSYCHIATRIC TREATMENT FOR 
TWO YEARS PRIOR TO DIANETIC AUDITING. SHE HAD EXPERIENCED NO RELIEF. 
MALNUTRITION. 


45 



An eighteen-year-old girl in a condition of apathy bordering upon a break and worsening. 
She had been recently married. Afraid of her husband. She had done very badly in school, 
sporadically engaged in sexual escapades, relapsing afterwards into an illness which was 
variously diagnosed. 

Case was entered with ease. Birth was reached and would not exhaust. A search for 
prenatals was for ten hours fruitless, until certain somatics were artificially restimulated and 
intensified to the point that the preclear had to recall the incident to find relief. Eight prenatals were 
then unstacked and only two incidents were discovered in confusion with each other, held 
together with a head somatic. 

The basic proved to be a mutual abortion attempt by the mother and father. The mother 
said she would die if anyone found out but that she would probably die anyway. The father said 
that the baby was probably like her and that he didn’t want it. Eighteen penetrations of the head, 
throat and shoulders with a long orange- wood stick — probably in the third month. Several similar 
incidents completed this chain. Coitus followed each attempt at abortion. Another incident proved 
to be a basic without a chain and with innumerable locks: an attempted abortion by a professional 
abortionist who used some form of needle and scraper. Birth was found to be a mild experience. 
Three infant engrams with their own basic were discovered. They consisted of the mother’s fear 
over the injury and the fear that the baby would die. 

Contagion of attempted abortion engrams was particularly manifest in the mother’s 
neurotic dwelling on fear of death, which was obviously a dramatization. 

All neurotic and psychotic symptoms were relieved with a marked improvement in the 
health of the preclear and an increase of twenty-seven points on the Army Alpha test. Time of 
work: 65 hours. 


CASE NO. 3 

PSYCHOTIC MURDEROUS RAGES. 

CHRONIC SKIN RASH. 

A thirty-year-old male negro, six feet four inches in height, about two hundred and fifty 
pounds — swamp worker. He was in continual trouble with police and had a considerable jail 
record. He continually dramatized a hatred of women. He also dramatized a continuous suspicion 
that he was about to be murdered. His I.Q. was about eighty-five. 

Uniquely enough this case offered no difficulties in entrance. The subject was extremely 
cooperative with the dianeticist. Birth was found and exhausted without improvement in the case. 
A number of infant and childhood engrams were discovered and tested. Continual address of the 
preclear’ s attention to prenatal life finally brought about a convulsion in which terror and rage 
alternated. The dianeticist was able to induce the preclear to listen to the voices he was hearing and 
to go through with the experience. 

The convulsion proved to be twenty engrams nearer birth than the basic, which lay on 
another chain and which was discovered by dream technique. The convulsion was caused by the 
dramatization of an engram involving the injection of turpentine into the uterus by the mother in an 
attempted abortion. The main engramic chain consisted of the mother’s efforts to abort herself. 
From engramic content it was gathered that the mother was a prostitute, for as many as twenty 
experiences of coitus succeeded two of these abortion attempts. They were too numerous to be 
evaluated. 


46 



The basic chain contained many quarrels about money between the mother and her 
customers. The somatics of this chain were largely bruises and concussions caused by the mother 
ramming herself into pointed objects, or beating her stomach and abdomen. There were many 
loops in the basic chain caused by the similarity of incident and the confusion of coitus with 
abortion attempts. The basic incident was at last discovered and exhausted. It was found to lie 
about twenty days after conception, when the mother first discovered her pregnancy. 

All engrams were exhausted in the basic chain. The convulsion was fully cleared and 
birth was suddenly found to have been a very painful experience, particularly because the child 
was taken by others immediately after birth. Only one engram chain (unconsciousness resulting 
from fist fights) was found in childhood. 


47 



.c. GLOSSARY 


A.A. — An attempted abortion case. 

ABERREE — An aberrated individual, sane or insane, containing unrelieved engrams. 

ANALYTICAL MIND — The residence of consciousness in the individual and the seat 
of his basic personality. This is an analogical term. The analytical mind can be sub-divided. 

ASSOCIATIVE RESTIMULATOR — A perceptic in the environment which is confused 
with an actual restimulator. 

BREAK ENGRAM — The secondary engram after the receipt of which the individual 
experienced a lowering of general tone to 2.5 or below and became therefore unable to cope with 
his environment. 

CLEAR — (1) Dianetic Clear: An individual who has been cleared of all engrams and 
chains and who has achieved a general tone four; a Dianetic Case Completion; one who through 
Dianetic processing has become free of those things which make a person susceptible to, and 
“hold in place,” psychosomatic ills, and is a healthy, happy human being. In this book Clear 
means Dianetic Clear. (2) Scientology Clear: A person who, having received all the processing 
gains from Dianetics to Grade VI (highest Scientology Release Grade), has then completed the 
Clearing Course at an Advanced Organization. A Scientology Clear has by definition the ability to 
be cause over mental matter, energy, space and time as regards the First Dynamic (ref. chapter 
The Dynamics, in this book). 

CONFUSION — The condition of an area of an engram or the condition of a chain. 
Instants of existence which are not properly aligned on the time track. 

CROSS ENGRAM — The severe engramic experience wherein two chains have met 
causing a marked change in the life of the individual. This is an engram which is on the time track 
of each of two or more chains. 

DIANETICIST — A skilled user of dianetic therapy. 

DIANETICS — Means “through the soul” (from Greek dia. through, and noes, soul). It 
is the first fully precise science of the mind. The world before Dianetics had never known a 
precision mental science. 

DISPERSAL — The action of a dynamic or purpose meeting an engram. It is describable 
by an analogy of an electron stream striking impedance and showering around it, much 
weakened. 

DYNAMIC — The dynamic thrust into time and space of an individual, a species, or a 
unit of matter or energy. Especially defined for the purpose of Dianetics as “Survive.” 

DYNAMIC DIANETICS — The science of the basic drives of the individual and his basic 
personality. At this writing the branch of Dianetics most intensely under observation and research 
is this one. (See Science of Survival by L. Ron Hubbard.) 

ENGRAM — A period of physical pain including unconsciousness and antagonism 
experienced by an individual, group or society and residing thereafter as irrational and 
restimulatable dramatizations. 


48 



ENGRAM CHAIN — A series of similar engrams on one or more dynamics which 
impede the dynamics of the individual. 

LOCK — A period of mental anguish depending for its force upon an engram. It may or 
may not be available to the analytical mind but it does not contain actual unconsciousness. 

PRECLEAR — Any individual receiving dianetic auditing for the purpose of being 
cleared; anyone not yet Clear. 

PURPOSE — The survival route chosen by an individual, a species, or a unit of matter or 
energy in the accomplishment of its goal. (NOTE: The purpose is specific and may be closely 
defined being a subdivision of one of the sub-dynamics. It has been tentatively established by 
investigation that an individual human being has established his purpose for life at the age of two 
years and that the actual purpose is not derived in any degree from engrams but is only warped by 
them.) 


REACTIVE MIND — That portion of the nervous system which contains reflexive or 
reactive data which does not clear through the analytical mind but is subject to dramatization or 
aberrations. It uses as a thought process the conception of identities. A equals A equals A. This is 
essentially the animal thinking mechanism. 

RELEASE — ( 1 ) Dianetic Release: A preclear in whom the majority of emotional stress 
has been deleted from the reactive mind. Has had large gains from Dianetics, is not yet a Dianetic 
Case Completion. (2) Scientology Release: A series of major levels of gain wherein Scientology 
processing frees the person from the principal life difficulties or personal “blocks” stemming from 
the mind. Called Release Grades, each of these levels must be completed for one to be ready to 
undertake Scientology Clearing. Note: Release, in this book, refers to Dianetic Release. 

RESTIMULATOR — The environmental perceptic which approximates a precise part of 
the engramic perceptics in the reactive mind. 

SCIENTOLOGY — The study of knowledge in its fullest sense, and applied religious 
philosophy that covers man’s relationship to the universe. Dianetics is the forerunner of 
Scientology. Dianetics was the ultimate development of the mind of human beings. Scientology is 
the road from there to total freedom. 

SOMATIC — The physiological counterpart of mental aberration. A somatic attends every 
aberration. This term is used in lieu of “physical pain” in auditing due to the high engramic value 
of the word pain and its failure to include in its meaning all painful perceptics. 

TIME TRACK — The memory record of an individual, motor or sensory, precisely 
aligned in moments of time. In a Clear all such moments are available to the analytical mind. In an 
aberree areas of the time track are obscured, but the time track is considered to be in perfect 
condition, if partially and temporarily obscured. The existence of two time tracks is suspected — 
one sensory and one motor, the latter being more available to the dianeticist in the form of 
somatics. The time track is precise but as the analytical mind addresses it in the aberree, it is 
apparently obliterated in part, or tangled. 

TONE — The emotional condition of an engram or the general condition of an individual. 

TRAUMA — A term from a school of psychology implying an experience which would 
create a psychic scar. It is unused in Dianetics as being liable to misunderstanding of the nature of 
severe experiences. Scars cannot be removed; psychosomatic experiences can be. 


49 



UNCONSCIOUSNESS — A condition wherein the organism is discoordinated only in 
its analytical process and motor control direction. In the physio-animal section of the brain, a 
complete time track and a complete memory record of all perceptions for all moments of the 
organism’s existence is available.
