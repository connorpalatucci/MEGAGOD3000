PREFACE 


Whatever view may be taken of the respective merits of 
Arabic and Persian poetry, I think it will generally be 
allowed by those familiar with the mystical literature of both 
nations that the Arabs excel in prose rather than in verse, 
while the Persian prose-writers on this subject cannot be 
compared with the poets. Faridu’ddfn ‘Attoir, Jal&lu’ddin 
Riimi, H&fiz, and Jdmi — to mention only a few of the great 
Persian poets Whose works, translated into various languages, 
have introduced the religious philosophy of Siifiism to a rapidly 
widening circle of European culture — are as much superior to 
their Arab rivals, including even the admirable Ibn al-Fdrid, 
as the Fut'Ahdt al-Mukkiyya and the Funiut al-Ifikam are 
superior to similar treatises in Persian. The Tarjumdn al - 
Ashwdq is no exception to this rule. The obscurity of its 
style and the strangeness of its imagery will satisfy those 
austere spirits for whom literature provides a refined and 
arduous form of intellectual exercise, but the sphere in which 
the author moves is too abstract and remote from common 
experience to give pleasure to others who do not share his 
visionary temper or have not themselves drawn inspiration 
from the same order of ideas. Nevertheless, the work of 
such a bold and subtle genius deserves, at any rate, to be 
studied, and students will find, as a reward for their labour, 
many noble and striking thoughts and some passages of real 
beauty. The following lines are often quoted. They express 
the Stifl doctrine that all ways lead to the One God. 

* My heart has become capable of every form; it is a pasture 
for gazelles and a convent for Christian monks, 

And a temple for idols and the pilgrim’s Ka'ba and the 
tables of the Tora and the book of the Koran. 

I follow the religion of Love : whatever way Love’s 
camels take, that is my religion and my faith .’ 1

PREFACE 


The present edition was designed in the first instance 
for the Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society, and is now 
published in its original shape. I will not repeat or expand 
what I have said in my brief introduction concerning the 
date of composition, the different recensions of the text, the 
method of interpretation, and the general character of these 
remarkable odes, but it may be useful to indicate in a few 
words some of the principal theories which are shadowed 
forth symbolically in the text and revealed more explicitly 
in the author’s commentary. Although the Tarjumdn a l- 
Ashwdq affords material for an essay on Ibn al-'Arabfs 
theosophy, I feel, speaking for myself, that further study of 
his works is necessary before such a task can be attempted 
with advantage. Much valuable information is contained in 
a treatise on Monism by ‘All b. Sult&n Muhammad al-Q&ri 
al-Harawf 1 — a polemic directed against Ibn al-‘Arabi and his 
followers who held that all Being is essentially one with God, 
notwithstanding its apparent diversity. This pamphlet was 
written in answer to a champion of Ibn al-‘Arabi, who had 
collected under twenty-four heads various passages in the 
Futnhdt and the FtwiU, to which objection was taken by 
orthodox theologians, and had endeavoured to justify the 
author against his critics. ‘All al-Qarf regards Ibn al-‘Arabi 
as a dangerous infidel and gives him no quarter. Of course 
the offending passages admit of more than one interpretation, 
and the author would doubtless have repudiated the con- 
struction put upon them by theologians. Their pantheistic 
import, however, cannot be explained away. I have classified 
the following examples for the sake of convenience and have 
added a few references to the commentary on the Tarjumdn. 

1. God and the World . Ibn al-‘Arabf says in the Futukdt ,

substance of every object in manifestation, although He is 
not the substance of objects in their essences/ 1 And again, 
in the Fusns , 4 God manifests Himself in every atom of 
creation : He is revealed in every intelligible object and 
concealed from every intelligence except the intelligence of 
those who say that the Universe is His form and ipseity 
djjye), inasmuch as He stands in the same relation to 

phenomenal objects as the spirit to the body/ 

2. Ood and Man . ‘ Man is the form of God and God is 

the spirit of Man/ ‘ Man is to God as the pupil to the eye : 
by means of him God beholds the objects which He has 
created/ 4 Man’s origin is both temporal and eternal ; he is 
an organism durable and everlasting/ 4 Man is the substance 
of every attribute wherewith he endows God : when he 
contemplates God he contemplates himself, and God con- 
templates Himself when He contemplates Man. Hence Abu 
Sa‘id al-Kharnlz said that he was a face and tongue of God, 
who is called by the name of Abu Sa 4 id al-Kharraz and also 
by other temporal names, because God unites all opposites 
in Himself/ 

God dwells in the heart of Man (vi, 1), and Man, invested 
with Divine qualities, is a mirror which displays God to 
Himself (x, 2). Divine qualities may justly be attributed 
to anyone who is so transported from himself that God 
becomes his eye and his ear (x, 1). Although union with 
God is not possible while the body exists (v, 2), Ibn al- 
‘Arabi, like Plotinus, holds that ‘deification’ is attainable 
(xxiv, 3). 2 Elsewhere he says that knowledge of God is the 
utmost goal that can be readied by any contingent being 
(xvii, 5). This knowledge is gained solely by means of 
Faith and Contemplation, which Reason may serve if it 
consents to lay aside its reflective faculty (iii, 2, 5). What, 
then, is the end of knowledge ? Apparently, a state of 
Nirvana or transcendental unconsciousness, ^

Divine essence does not enter into creation. *

(v, 6). The phenomenal vanishes in presence of the 
Eternal (xx, 19). 

3. Religion. Since all things are a manifestation of the 
Divine substance, it follows that God may be worshipped in 
a star or a calf or any other object, and that no form of 
positive religion contains more than a portion of the truth. 
‘Do not attach yourself/ I bn al-‘Arabi says, ‘to any particular 
creed exclusively, so that you disbelieve in all the rest ; 
otherwise you will lose much good, nay, you will fail to 
recognize the real truth of the matter. Let your soul be 
capable of embracing all forms of belief. God, the omni- 
present and omnipotent, is not limited by any one creed, for 
He says, “ Wheresoever ye turn, there is the face of Allah ” 
(Kor. ii, 109) ; and the face of a thing is its reality .’ It is 
vain to quarrel about religion. ‘ Everyone praises what 
he believes ; his god is his own creature, and in praising it 
he praises himself. Consequently he blames the beliefs of 
others, which he would not do if he were just, but his dislike 
is based on ignorance. If he knew Junayd’s saying — “the 
water takes its colour from the vessel containing it” — lie 
would not interfere with the beliefs of others, but would 
perceive God in every form and in every belief/ 1 The Divine 
substance remains unchanged and unchangeable amidst all 

n o 

the variety of religious experience. ‘ Those who worship 
God in the sun behold a sun, and those who worship Him in 
living things see a living thing, and those who worship Him 
in inanimate objects see an inanimate object, and those who 
worship Him as a Being unique and unparalleled see that 
which has no like (xii, 13). In a noteworthy passage Ibn 
al-‘Arabi seeks to harmonize Islam with Christianity. The 
Christian Trinity, he says, is essentially a Unity which has 
its counterpart in the three cardinal Names whereby God is 
signified in the Koran, viz. Allah, ar-Rahman, and ar-Rabb 
(xii, 4). Islam is peculiarly the religion of. Love (xi, 15), 
and God's mercy is denied to none, be he Moslem or infidel, 
who invokes Him in the extremity of his need. Even if it

so be that the unbelievers shall remain in Hell for ever, they 
will at last feel its fiery torments a pleasure and delight. 

Ibn al-‘Arabi is said to have claimed that he was the Seal 
of the Saints, as was the Seal of the Prophets, 

and also that the Saints are superior to the Prophets, but it 
is very doubtful whether these accusations are well founded. 
He seems to have maintained that the Prophets, in so far as 
they are Saints, derive their knowledge from the Seal of the 
Saints, and that the Prophets in virtue of their saintship are 
superior to the Prophets in virtue of their prophetic dignity 
(cf. iv, i ; xviii, 8). He does assert, however, that he had 
reached a spiritual degree which was not attained by any of 
his peers (xxiv, 4). 

I desire gratefully to acknowledge the valuable assistance 
of Sir Charles Lyall, who read the text and translation in 
manuscript, and made a number of suggestions, nearly all of 
which I have inserted in the book while it was passing 
through the press. The fact that it has undergone his 
criticism enables me to offer it to students of Arabic 
poetry with more confidence than would otherwise have 
been possible. My thanks are due also to the Librarian of 
the University of Leiden, who caused two MSS. of the 
Tarjumdn to be sent to Cambridge, and allowed them to 
re main there as Irma* as thev were remiired. 




THE TARJUMAN AL ASHWAQ 


Although Ibn al-‘Arabi (560-638 a.h.) is the most celebrated 
of all Muhammadan mystics, the only one of his 150 extant 
works that has hitherto appeared in a European edition is 
the brief glossary of Sufi technical terms (cjU^Usu^) which 
was published by Fluegel in 1845, together with the Ta/rif&t 
of Jurjani, under the title of Definitiones theosophi Mohji- 
cd-din Mohammed ben AH vulgo Ibn Ardbi dicti. So far 
as I am aware, none of his books has been translated into 
any European language, and no trustworthy account can yet 
be given of his vast theosophical speculations, which produced 
an extraordinary impression throughout the Moslem world. 
By far the larger portion of his writings is in prose, but the 
poetical remnant includes a Diwdn of about 450 pages 
(published at Biilaq in 1271 a.ii.) and several smaller 
collections. One of these is the Tarjumdn al-Ashwdq or 
‘ Interpreter of Desires The fact that it is accompanied 
by a commentary, in which the author himself explains the 
meaning of almost every verse, was the principal motive 
that induced me to study it ; its brevity was a strong 
recommendation ; and something, I suppose, may be attributed 
to my possessing an excellent MS., which, as is noted on the 
last page, has twice undergone collation and correction. 

A curious problem of literary history is involved in the 
question of the date at which the poems and the commentary 
were composed. The MSS. of the Tarjumdn al-Ashwdq 
exhibit three different recensions. The first recension , 
represented by Leiden 875 (2), Brit. Mus. 1527 and Gotha 
2268, contains the poems without the commentary . In his 
preface Ibn al-'Arabi refers to his arrival in Mecca in 
598 A.H., and Dozy assumed — on insufficient grounds, as 
I shall presently show — that the poems were composed in 
that year. They were condemned by some devout Moslems 



2 


THE TARJUMAN AL-A8HWAQ 


as ‘ vain and amatorious and in order to refute his critics 


the author issued a second recension , represented by Leiden 
641 and Brit. Mus. 754 containing the same poems with 
a commentary and a new preface, in which he declares that 
he composed these poems, while visiting the holy places at 
Mecca, in the months of Rajab, SlnVban, and Ramadan, 
611 A.H. The third recension is represented by Bodl. (Uri) 
1276, Munich 524 1 , Berlin 7750 and 7751, and the MS. cited 


by H&jji Khalifa (Fluegels edition), ii, 276. It agrees with 
the second in giving the date of composition as 611 A.H., but 
includes a statement of the circumstances which caused the 


author to write his commentary. 

My MS. seems to be unique 1 in so far as it contains 
the preface belonging to the first recension and also the 
additional statement which differentiates the third recension 
from the second. 


Dozy, as I have said, believed that the true date of 
composition, namely 598 A.H., was given by the author in 
the preface to the first recension, and that on publishing 
the second recension he post-dated it by thirteen years. 
‘To wipe out the memory of his offence the poet not only 
proved by means of his commentary that Heavenly, not 
earthly, love was the theme that inspired him, but he also 
pretended that the poems were composed at a different time ; 
by which artifice, though he could not deceive those who had 
read them before, he might dupe anyone who had heard 
people talk of them and the scandal produced by them/ 2 
Before considering the justice of Dozy’s criticism it will be 
well to set forth the evidence more fully than he has done. 
I shall therefore summarize the contents of the prose sections 
which form an introduction to the text of the poems. 


1 Perhaps I should say ‘ almost unique ’, since Pertsch’s description of 
Gotha 2269, which is defective at the beginning, leads me to suppose that 
it resembles my MS. in this particular. The Gotha MS., however, has 
the date 611 a. it., which is wanting in mine. 

2 Leiden Cat., ii, 77. The last clause, as printed, runs : * qui de iis deque 
magua ofFensione cuius causa exstiterant, fando audiverant,’ i.e. ‘the 
scandal which had produced them Dozy cannot have meant to write this. 



THE TARJEMAN AL-ASHWAQ

1. Preface to the First Recension 1 

On his arrival at Mecca in 598 a.h. Ibn al-‘Arabi found 
a number of scholars and divines, both male and female, 
whose ancestors had emigrated from Persia in the early days 
of Islam. He particularly mentions Makinu’ddm Abu Shuja‘ 
Zahir b. Rustam b. Abi 'r-Raja al-Isbah&ni and his aged sister, 
Fakhru ’n-Nistl bint Rustam. [With the former he read the 
book of Abu ‘Isa at-Tirinidhi on the Apostolic Traditions. 
He begged Fakhru ’n-Nisa to let him hear Traditions from her, 
but she excused herself on the plea of her great age, saying 
that she wished to spend the last years of her life in devotion. 
She consented, however, that her brother should write for 

Ibn al-‘Arabi, on her behalf, a general certificate (<*JSU 
for all the Traditions which she related ; and he received 
a similar certificate from Makinu ’ddin himself.] 2 

Maldnu ’ddin had a young daughter, called Niz&m and 
surnamed ‘Aynu ’sh-Shams wa ’l-Baha, who was exceedingly 
beautiful and was renowned for her asceticism and eloquent 
preaching. [The author says that he would have descanted 
on her physical and moral perfections .had he not been 
deterred by the weakness of human souls, which are easily 
corrupted, but he eulogizes her learning, literary accomplish- 
ments, and spiritual gifts.] Ibn al-‘Arabi observed the 
nobility of her nature, which was enhanced by the society 
of her father and aunt. He celebrated her in the poems 
contained in this volume, using the erotic style and 
vocabulary, but he could not express even a small part of 
the feelings roused in him by the recollection of his love for 

her in past times L L-XJ jj jJj! ^ 

l&Afs [Here my MS. adds: 

‘ Nevertheless I have put into verse for her sake some of 
the longing thoughts suggested by those precious memories, 


1 I follow the text of my MS. The passages which occur in it, but not in 
the Leiden MS. 875 (2), are enclosed in square brackets. The Arabic text 
will be found below. 

2 Instead of the foregoing passage the Leiden MS. 875 (2) has : ‘ And 
I received a certificate from both of them. *

and I have uttered the sentiments of a yearning soul and 
have indicated the sincere attachment which I feel, fixing 
my mind on the bygone days and those scenes which her 

society has endeared to me jjill jLfdb 

^-XJ!).] The author continues: ‘Whenever I mention 
a name in this book I always allude to her, and whenever 
I mourn over an abode I mean her abode. In these poems 
I always signify Divine influences and spiritual revelations 
and sublime analogies, according to the most excellent way 
which we (Sufis) follow . . . God forbid that readers of 
this book and of my other poems should think of aught 
unbecoming to souls that scorn evil and to lofty spirits that 
are attached to the things of Heaven ! Amen ! ’ 

[These pages include the love-poems which I composed at 
Mecca, whilst visiting the holy places in the months of 
Rajab, Sha'ban, and Ramadan. In these poems I point 
(allegorically) to various sorts of Divine knowledge and 
spiritual mysteries and intellectual sciences and religious 
exhortations. I have used the erotic style and form of 
expression because men’s souls are enamoured of it, so that 
there are many reasons why it should commend itself.] 

2. Preface to the Second Recension 

After giving a list of Ibn al-‘Arabfs names and titles, the 
text proceeds as in the last paragraph within square 
brackets : ‘ These pages include the love-poems which 

I composed at Mecca ... in the months of Rajab, Sha‘bdn, 
and Ramad&n in the year 611. In these poems/ etc., 
without further variation. 

3. Preface to the Third Recension 

This is identical with the last, but contains in addition 
the following statement of the motives which induced the 
author to write his commentary. 1 

‘I wrote this commentary on the Diwdn entitled Tarjumdn 

1 In some MSS. this statement does not form part of the preface, but is 
placed after the text and commentary. It occurs in my MS. on fol. 140a.

al-Ashwdq, which I composed at Mecca, at the request of 
my friend al-Mas‘ud AM Muhammad Badr b. ‘Abdallah 
al-Habasln al-Kh&dim and al-Walad al-B&rr Sliamsu ’ddin 
Isma/il b. Siidakin an-Nuri 1 in the city of Aleppo. He 
(Shamsu ’ddin) had heard some theologian remark that the 
author’s declaration in the preface to the Tarjumdn was 
not true, his declaration, namely, that the love-poems in 
this collection refer to mystical sciences and realities. 
“ Probably,” said the critic, “ he adopted this device in order 
to protect himself from the imputation that he, a man 
famous for religion and piety, composed poetry in the erotic 
style.” Shamsu ’ddin was offended by his observations and 
repeated them to me. Accordingly, I began to write the 
commentary at Aleppo, and a portion of it was read aloud 
in my lodging in the presence of the above-mentioned 
theologian and other divines by Kamalu ’ddin Abu ’l-Q&sim 
b. Najmu ’ddin the Cadi Ibn al-‘Adim 2 — God bless him ! 
I finished it with difficulty and in an imperfect manner, for 
I was in haste to continue my journey, on the date already 
mentioned . 3 When my critic heard it he said to Shamsu ’ddin 
that he would never in future doubt the good faith of any 
Sufis who should assert that they attached a mystical 
signification to the words used in ordinary speech ; and he 
conceived an excellent opinion of me and profited (by my 
writings). This was the occasion of my explaining the 
Tarjumdn! 

I have now laid before the reader nearly all the available 
materials for a solution of this problem. How, then, does it 
stand with the charge of falsification brought by Dozy 
against Ibn al-‘Arabi ? 

Dozy’s theory seems to me untenable on the following 
grounds : — 

1 He wrote commentaries on two treatises by Ibn al-‘Arabf (see 
Brockelmann, i, 443). 

2 This is the well-known historian of Aleppo. 

3 No date is mentioned in my MS. According to Hdjji Khalifa (ii, 277), 
the author finished his commentary in the second Rabi‘, 612 a.h. (July- 
August, 1215 a. D.), at Aqsaray (in Lycaonia). 



6 


THE TARJUMAN AL-ASHWAQ 


(a) Ibn al-‘Arabi does not imply, in the preface to the 
first recension, that the poems were composed in 598 a.h. 
Although he only arrived at Mecca in that year, he speaks 
of his acquaintance with Nizam, the daughter of Maldnu ’ddin, 
as something past , and of Makmu ’ddin himself as no longer 
alive. 1 

(b) The hypothesis that 598 A.H. was the date of com- 
position is not required. No arguments have been advanced 
to show that the date given by the author, Gil a.h., is 
impossible or unlikely. There is nothing incredible in the 
statement that, while visiting the holy shrines at Mecca in 
this year, the author was inspired by those familiar scenes 
to celebrate in mystical fashion the feelings of love connected 
with an earlier period of his life. 

(c) The poems themselves contain evidence that they were 
not composed at the date which Dozy attributes to them. 
The second and third verses of the thirty -second poem run 
as follows : — 

Ibn al-‘Arabi was 50 years old when he wrote these 
verses. 2 He was born in 560 a.h., so that in 598 a.h. his 
age was only 38. In 611 a.h. he was 51. To say '50' 
instead of ‘ 51 ’ is a small poetical licence, which needs no 
apology, whereas on Dozy’s supposition the author must 
have antedated his age and post-dated his poems by 
considerably more than a decade in each case. 

We may therefore conclude that Ibn al-‘Arabf’s account 
of the matter is correct, and that the composition of the 
Tarjumdn al-Aslavdq was finished in Ramadan, 611 A.H. 
(January, 1215 A.D.). A few months afterwards the author 
began to write his commentary at Aleppo, for Hajji Khalifa 
tells us that it was completed in Rabf‘ ath-thanl of the 
following year (August, 1215 A.D.). 

1 This is indicated by the words which follow his name. 

2 Another reference to the poet’s age occurs in xxxvi, 2. 



THE TARJUMAN AL-ASHWAQ 


7 


The further question, whether Ibn al-‘Arabi was quite 
sincere when he claimed that his poems were intended 
to be mystical in spirit, though erotic in form, must, 
I think, be answered in the affirmative. Students of 
Oriental poetry have sometimes to ask themselves, ‘ Is 
this a love-poem disguised as a mystical ode, or a mystical 
ode expressed in the language of human love ? ’ and to 
acknowledge that they cannot tell. Here, however, the 
balance is not so nicely poised that every reader may be 
allowed to choose the interpretation which pleases him. 
Some of the poems, it is true, are not distinguishable from 
ordinary love-songs, and as regards a great portion of the 
text, the attitude of the authors contemporaries, who refused 
to believe that it had any esoteric sense at all, was natural 
and intelligible ; on the other hand, there are many passages 
which are obviously mystical and give a clue to the rest. If 
the sceptics lacked discernment, they deserve our gratitude for 
having provoked Ibn al-‘Arabf to instruct them. Assuredly, 
without his guidance the most sympathetic readers would 
seldom have hit upon the hidden meanings which his fantastic 
ingenuity elicits from the conventional phrases of an Arabic 
qaMda. 1 But the fact that his explanations overshoot the 
mark is no proof of his insincerity : he had to satisfy his 
critics, and it would have been difficult to convince them 
that the poems were mystical in spirit and intention unless 
he had given a precise and definite interpretation of every 
line and of almost every word. The necessity of entering 
into trivial details — an Arab is in any case apt to exaggerate 
details at the expense of the whole — drives the author to 
take refuge in far-fetched verbal analogies and causes him 
to descend with startling rapidity from the sublime to the 


1 The author admits that in some passages of his poems the mystical 
import was not clear to himself, and that various explanations were 

suggested to him in moments of ecstasy : $ jjfc

THE TARJUMAN AL-ASHWAQ 


ridiculous. We have seen that when he published his 
commentary he omitted from the preface those passages 
relating to the beautiful and accomplished Nizam which 
occur in the first recension. No doubt they had been 
misunderstood; it was inevitable that they should excite 
suspicion. To cancel them was merely to deprive his critics 
of a powerful weapon against which he could not defend 
himself effectively. For, if Nizam was to him (and manifestly 
she was nothing else) a Beatrice, a type of heavenly perfection, 
an embodiment of Divine love and beauty, yet in the world’s 
eyes he ran the risk of appearing as a lover who protests his 
devotion to an abstract ideal while openly celebrating the 
charms of his mistress. In the poems she is scarcely ever 
mentioned by name, but there are one or two particular 
references which I will quote here : — 

i Long have I yearned for a tender maiden, endowed with prose 
and verse (^lliJ. having a pulpit, eloquent, 

One of the princesses from the land of Persia, from the most 
glorious of cities, from Isfah&n. 

She is the daughter of ‘Iraq, the daughter of my Imam, and 
I am her opposite, a child of Yemen.’ 

(XX, 15-17.) ’ 

‘ 0 my two comrades, may my life-blood be the ransom of a slender 
girl who bestowed on me favours and bounties ! 

She established the harmony of union, for she is our principle of 
harmony (L^Ujj): she is both Arab and foreign: she makes 
the gnostic forget. 

Whenever she gazes, she draws against thee trenchant swords, 
and her front teeth show to thee a dazzling levin.* 

(XXIX, 13-15.) 

‘ Yerily, she is an Arab girl belonging by origin to the daughters 
of Persia, yea, verily. 

Beauty strung for her a row of fine pearly teeth, white and pure 
as crystal.’ 

(XLII, 4-5.) 

Since I do not propose either to discuss the poems from 
a literary and artistic standpoint or to give an account of 
the mystical doctrines which the author has occasion to

touch upon in the course of his commentary, it only remains 
to describe the MSS. which I have used in preparing this 
edition. 

1. A MS. in my collection, dated 1029 a.h. It contains 
both the text of the poems (written with red ink) and the 
commentary. Inscriptions on the last page certify that it 
has been twice diligently collated and corrected. In referring 
to it I shall use the designation N. 

2. A MS. in the Leiden University Library, Cod. 875 (2) 
Warn, (see Dozy’s Catalogue , ii, 74). It contains only the 
text of the poems, witli a preface, and is dated 992 a.h. In 
referring to it I shall use the designation L. 

3. A MS. in the Leiden University Library, Cod. 641 
Warn, (see Dozy’s Catalogue , ii, 75-7). It is dated 984 a.h., 
and contains both text and commentary. In referring to it 
I shall use the designation M. 

The Arabic text printed below is based on N., and the 
variants in LM. are noted at the foot of the page. The text, 
which exhibits many grammatical and metrical irregularities, 
is not vocalized in any of these MSS. 

The commentary in N., from which my translation is 
made* is sometimes not so full as that in M. The latter 
includes a few excerpts from the Futuhdt al-Makkiyya. 
The English version of the commentary is usually very much 
abridged, but I have rendered the interesting and important 
passages nearly word for word. 1 

I shall now transcribe the text of the preface and the 
poems according to N. The Arabic text will be followed by 
an English version of the poems, with annotations based on 
the author’s commentary. 


1 The correct title of the commentary seems to be y jJl JDL »tj 

a U 5 j -jj ; it is derived from the phrase ylsLjJl V.J3J 

, which occurs in the preface (p. 12, 1. 7 infra). The erroneous reading 
is found in most MSS., and Hajji Khalifa gives the title of the 






-commentary as sH&SL j[&.

TRANSLATION AND COMMENTARY 

I 

1. Would that I were aware whether they knew what heart 

they possessed ! 

2. And would that my heart knew what mountain-pass they 

threaded ! 

3. Dost thou deem them safe or dost thou deem them dead ? 

4. Lovers lose their way in love and become entangled. 

Commentary 

1. ‘ They/ i.e. the Divine Ideas (^kW of which the 

hearts (of gnostics) are passionately enamoured, and by 
which the spirits are distraught, and for whose sake the 
godly workers jUjtH) perform their works of 

devotion. 

‘ What heart ’ : he refers to the perfect Muhammadan 
heart, because it is not limited by stations' 
Nevertheless, it is possessed by the Divine Ideas, for they 
seek it and it seeks them. They cannot know that they 
possess it, for they belong to its essence, inasmuch as it 
beholds in them nothing except its own nature. 

2. ‘ What mountain-pass they threaded/ i.e. what gnostic's 
heart they entered when they vanished from mine. * Mountain - 
pass ’ signifies a ‘ station ’ ( ^UU ), which is fixed, in contrast 
to a 4 state ’ ( JU-), which is fleeting. 

3. The Divine Ideas, qud Ideas, exist only in the existence 
of the seer ; they are * dead ’ in so far as the seer is non- 
existent. 

4. Lovers are perplexed between two opposite things, for 
the lover wishes to be in accord with the Beloved and also 
wishes to be united with Him, so that if the Beloved wishes 
to be separated from the lover, the lover is in a dilemma. 



THE TAKJUMAN AL-ASHWAQ (il) 

II 


49 


1. On the day of parting they did not saddle the full-grown 

reddish-white camels until they had mounted the 
peacocks upon them, 

2. Peacocks with murderous glances and sovereign power: 

thou wouldst fancy that each of them was a Bilqls on 
her throne of pearls. 

3. When she walks on the glass pavement 1 thou seest a sun 

on a celestial sphere in the bosom of Idris. 

4. When she kills with her glances, her speech restores to 

life, as tho’ she, in giving life thereby, were Jesus. 

5. The smooth surface of her legs is (like) the Tora in 

brightness, and I follow it and tread in its footsteps 
as tho’ I were Moses. 

6. She is a bishopess, one of the daughters of Rome, un- 

adorned : thou seest in her a radiant Goodness. 2 

7. Wild is she, none can make her his friend ; she has 

gotten in her solitary chamber a mausoleum for 
remembrance. 

8. She has baffled everyone who is learned in our religion, 

every student of the Psalms of David, every Jewish 
doctor, and every Christian priest. 

9. If with a gesture she demands the Gospel, thou wouldst 

deem us to be priests and patriarchs and deacons. 

10. The day when they departed on the road, I prepared 

for war the armies of my patience, host after host. 

11. When my soul reached the throat (i.e. when I was at 

the point of death), I besought that Beauty and that 
Grace to grant me relief, 

12. And she yielded — may God preserve us from her evil, 

and may the victorious king repel Iblis ! 

13. I exclaimed, when her she-camel set out to depart, 

‘ 0 driver of the reddish- white camels, do not drive 
them away with her!’ 

1 Kor. xxvii, 44.

THE TARJUMAN AL-ASHWAQ (ll) 

Commentary 

1. * The full-grown camels/ i.e. the actions inward and out- 
ward, for they exalt the good word to Him who is throned 
on high, as He hath said: ‘ And the good deed exalts it' 
(Kor. xxxv, 11). 'The peacocks’ mounted on them are his 
loved ones : he likens them to peacocks because of their 
beauty. The peacocks are the spirits of those actions, for 
no action is acceptable or good or fair until it hath a spirit 
consisting in the intention or desire of its doer. He compares 
them to birds inasmuch as they are spiritual and also for the 
variety of their beauty. 

2. ‘ With murderous glances and sovereign power ’ : he 
refers to the Divine wisdom (aLaiH <u£r*-) which accrues to 
a man in his hours of solitude, and which assaults him with 

such violence that he is unable to behold his personality 

• 

^ and which exercises dominion 

over him. 

‘ A Bilqis on her throne of pearls ’ : he refers to that 
which was manifested to Gabriel and to the Prophet during 

his night journey upon the bed (i j/j') of pearl and jacinth 

in the terrestrial heaven, when Gabriel alone .swooned by 
reason of his knowledge of Him who manifested Himself 
on that occasion. The author calls the Divine wisdom 
* Bilqis ’ on account of its being the child of theory, which 
is subtle, and practice, which is gross, just as Bilqis was both 
spirit and woman, since her father was of the Jinn and her 
mother was of mankind. 

3. The mention of Idris alludes to her lofty and exalted 
rank. ‘ In the bosom of Idris/ i.e. under his control, in 
respect of his turning her wheresoever he will, as the 
Prophet said : ‘ Do not bestow wisdom on those who are 
unworthy of it, lest ye do it a wrong/ The opposite case is 
that of one who speaks because he is dominated by his 
feeling (JL-), and who is therefore under the control of an 

influence (j,U). In this verse the author calls attention to 
his puissance in virtue of a prophetic heritage (&;£*:? Jjt 



THE TARJUMAN AL-ASHWAQ (il) 


51 


for the prophets are masters of their spiritual 

feelings (J^^sJ), whereas most of the saints are mastered by 
them. The sun is joined to Idris because the sun is his 
sphere, and the Divine wisdom is described as 4 walking * 
(instead of f running*, etc.) because of her pride and haughti- 
ness, and because she moves in the feelings of this heart and 
changes from one feeling to another with a sort of absolute 

power ^ <-rV2j)* 

4. ‘ She kills with her glances * : referring to the station 
of passing away in contemplation (i'jjblkiM *LiM). 4 Her 
speech restores to life * : referring to the completion of the 
moulding of man when the spirit was breathed into him. 
She is compared to Jesus in reference to Kor. xxxviii, 72, 
4 And I breathed into him of My spirit,’ or Kor. xvi, 42, 
4 That We say to it 44 Be ”, and it is’ 

5. 4 Her legs* : referring to Bilqfs and the glass pavement 
(Kor. xxvii, 44). 

4 Is like the Tora in brightness/ because the Tora (i 
is derived from the phrase yj'yy 4 the stick produced 


Are.* The four faces (*=>-/) of the Tora, namely, the four 
Books (the Koran, the Psalms, the Pentateuch, and the 
Gospel), correspond to the fourfold light mentioned in 
Kor. xxiv, 35 (c^> 

6. 4 One of the daughters of Rome * : this wisdom, being 
of the race of Jesus (j&!s£h is described as belonging 


to the Roman Empire. 4 Unadorned/ i.e. she is of the 

essence of unification (jur^M) and without any vestige of 

adornment from the Divine Names, yet there shines from 

her the 4 radiance * of Absolute Goodness, viz. the burning 

splendours (ij* ciAsiiM) which, if God were to remove 

* 

the veils of light and darkness, would consume the glories of 
His face 

7. 4 Wild is she, none can make her his friend/ because 
contemplation of the Essence is a passing away (*Ui), in 



52 


THE TARJUMAN AL-ASHWAQ (il) 


which, as as-Sayydri 1 said, there is no pleasure. She is 
‘ wild ’, inasmuch as noble souls desire to seize her, but she 
does not show friendship to them, because no relation exists 
between them and her. 

‘ In *her solitary chamber/ i.e. in the heart. Her solitude 
is her looking on herself, for God says, ‘ Neither My earth 
nor My heaven contains Me, but I am contained by the heart 
of My servant who is a believer ’ ; and since the heart which 
contains this essential wisdom of the race of Jesus is bare 

and empty of all attributes juyslll ^\jU ^y), it is 

like a desert and she is like a wild animal. Then he 
mentions the marble tomb of the Roman emperors, that 
such a mausoleum may remind her of death, which is the 
severance of union, and make her shun familiarity with the 
created world on account of this severance. 

8. The four Books (the Koran, the Psalms, the Tora, and 
the Gospel) are here indicated by the mention of those who 
study and expound them. All the sciences comprised in the 
four Books point only to the Divine Names and are incapable 
of solving a question that concerns the Divine Essence. 

9. If this spiritual being, forasmuch as she is of the race 

t 

of Jesus, appeals to the Gospel by way of justifying it in 
anything which men’s thoughts have falsely imputed to it, 
we humble ourselves before her and serve her no less 
devotedly than do the heads of the Church, because of her 
majesty and sovereign might. 

10. ‘ Upon the road/ i.e. the spiritual ascension 

11. ‘To grant me relief’: he means what the Prophet 

meant by his saying, * Lo, the breath of the Merciful comes 
to me from the quarter of al-Yaman.’ The writer begs that 
the world of breaths jJLc) may continually be wafted 

from her to him along with the spiritual feelings (Jly*!)* 

1 Abu ^-‘Abbds as-Sayy&ri of Merv (died .342 a.h.). His doctrine of union 

and separation (djju • £-*>*) is explained by al-Hujwlri in the Kashf 
al-Mahjub. ^ 



THE TARJUMAN AL-ASHWAQ (il, III) 


53 


The Arabs refer to this in their poetry, for they speak of 
giving greetings and news to be delivered by the winds 
when they blow. 

12. ‘May God preserve us from her evil!’ He refers to 
the Tradition ‘ I take refuge with Thee from Thyself \ 

‘ The victorious king/ i.e. thoughts of knowledge and 
Divine guidance. 

* Iblis/ i.e. the thought of becoming one with God (jW^), 
for this is a hard station, and few who attain to it escape 

from the doctrines of jlaJM and incarnation It is 

the station indicated in the Tradition ‘ I am his ear and his 
eye ’, etc. 

13. He says, ‘ When this spiritual essence desired to quit 
this noble heart on account of its (the heart’s) return from 
the station denoted by the words, “ I have an hour which 
I share with none save my Lord,” to the task imposed upon it 
of presiding over the phenomenal worlds, for which purpose 
its gaze is directed towards the Divine Names, the lofty 
aspiration (XX&) on which this spiritual essence was borne 
to the heart, took its departure.’ He calls this aspiration 
‘ her she-camel ’, and the drivers of such aspirations are the 

angels who approach nearest to God (^JjUll)* 

III 

1. 0 ray two friends, pass by al-Kathib and turn towards 

La‘la‘ and seek the waters of Yalamlam, 

2. For there dwell those whom thou knowest and those to 

whom belong my fasting and my pilgrimage and my 
visit to the holy places and my festival. 

3. Never let me forget at al-Muliassab of Min& and at 

al-Manhar al-A‘ld and Zamzam certain grave matters. 

4. Their Muhassab is my heart, because of their casting the 

pebbles, and their place of sacrifice is my soul, and 
their well is my blood. 

5. 0 camel-driver, if thou comest to H&jir, stop the beasts 

a little while and give a greeting, 



54 


THE TARJUMAN AL-ASHWAQ (ill) 


6. And address to the red tents on the side of the guarded 

pasture the salutation of one who longs for you and 
is distraught. 

7. And if they return thy greeting, once more let the East 

wind bring thy salaam to them ; and if they are 
silent, journey on with thy camels and advance 

8. To the river of Jesus, where their riding-camels halted and 

where the white tents lie beside the river-mouth, 

9. And call Da‘d and ar-Rab&b and Zaynab and Hind and 

Salm& and Lubnd, and listen, 

10. And ask them whether at al-Ilalba is She, the limber 
one who shows thee the radiance of the sun when 
she smiles. 


Commentary 

1. my two friends/ i.e. his reason and his faith. 

‘ Al-Kathib/ the place of contemplation. 

‘ La‘la‘/ the place of bewilderment and amazement, that 
he may no more be conscious of love and longing. 

‘ The waters of Yalamlam/ i.e. the fountain of life, since 
water is the source of every living thing. 

2. ‘Thou knowest*: he addresses Faith, not Reason, for 
knowledge of the Essence and of its attributes is gained 
solely by means of Faith. 

‘ And those to whom belong/ etc., i.e. the Divine attributes. 

‘ My fasting ’ : he means the quality of being independent 
of food as God said, ‘Fasting belongs to 

Me/ i.e. that quality cannot truly be predicated of a man ; 
yet a man has some part in fasting, since it entails abstinence 
from food and nourishment. 

‘ My pilgrimage/ i.e. a repeated turning towards this pure 
Essence for the sake of gaining a blessing at every moment 
from the Divine Names. This pilgrimage and visitation 
is incessant, though a man is momently going from 
one Name to another. 

‘ My festival/ referring to the concentration J of the 
mind when all mystical stations and Divine verities are 



THE TARJUMAN AL-ASHWAQ (ill) 


55 


united therein, just as all sorts and conditions of men 
assemble at Mecca £or one purpose. 

3. ‘ Never let me forget ’ : he alludes to an occasion when 

he became invested with Divine qualities (likW lilac*) in the 
sense of the Tradition ‘ I am his ear and his eye and he 
also calls attention to his having attained by Divine in- 
vestiture the station which is described in the words ' And 
thy Lord is not forgetful ’ (Kor. xix, 65). 

‘ At al-Muhassab/ the place where the pebbles are cast. 
He refers to the verse ' And remember God even as ye 
remember your fathers , or more reverently ’ (Kor. ii, 196), 
i.e. in this place cast the memory of your fathers out of 
your hearts and mouths. 

‘ At al-Manhar al-A'la/ the place of (spiritual) sacrifice, 
as the poet says : 

‘ Thou offerest victims, but I offer my life-blood.’ 

‘ Zamzam ’ : he means the station of everlasting life. 

4. ' Their Muhassab ’ : ‘ their ’ refers to the Divine verities 

• » » 

which descend upon the heart and cast out sensual and 
devilish thoughts. 

‘ Their place of sacrifice ’ : the story is well known of the 
youth who mentally offered himself at Mina when he saw 
the people offering sacrifice, and died on the spot. 

5. '0 camel -driver ’ : he addresses the Desire which drives 
his thoughts to the abode of those whom he loves. 

‘ Hdjir ’ : hijr is the understanding, and the way (to God) 
is only through faith and contemplation, not through the 
understanding in respect of its power of reflection but in 
virtue of its cognition and belief. 

'Stop the beasts a little while/ because when the lover 
first approaches the dwelling-place of his beloved he is dazed 
and dumbfounded and often swoons ; consequently he is apt 
to break the rules of good manners in greeting her. 

6. ‘ The red tents ’ : the Arabs deem red the most beautiful 
of all colours, and red tents are reserved for brides. 

‘ On the side of the guarded pasture/ i.e. the tents are 



56 


THE TARJUMAN AL-ASHWAQ (ill, IV) 


inaccessible except to those who have the right to approach 
them. He calls the tents qibdb (round tents or domes) 
because roundness is the first and best of shapes, and he 
says that the Divine Realities which he loves are in their 
original home, which is beside God, not beside any phe- 
nomenal object, for they belong to 4 the world of command ’ 

jJU). 

7. ‘ Let the East wind/ etc. : he mentions the East wind 
particularly, because mbd signifies ‘ inclination 5 (mayl). 

8. 4 To the river of Jesus,’ i.e. to the ample knowledge 
manifested in Jesus 

‘The white tents’: white, because Jesus was born of 
a virgin. 

* Beside the river-mouth/ i.e. this knowledge is approached 
by the way of Divine allocution and manifestation ^ 

9. He says, ‘ Call the names of these Divine Realities 
according to their difference, in order that whichever is 
yours may respond to you and that thus you may know 
what is your position in regard to them.’ 

10. * Al-Halba/ a quarter of Baghdad. Halba means ‘race- 
course ’. The Divine Realities strive to outstrip one another 
in haste to reach the phenomena which display their traces 
and manifest their power. Hence he speaks of ‘ the limber 
one ’, i.e. inclining towards the phenomenal world. 

‘ The radiance of the sun ’ : formerly thou wert in a station 
of Jesus, but now thou art asking of a station of Idris, lofty 

and polar (^JaS for to him belongs the fourth heaven. 

‘ When she smiles ’ : he indicates that this is the station 
of Expansion (ki^H ^Uu) an d that she is with him in joy 
and beauty (not in awe and majesty). 

IV 

1. Greeting to Salma and to those who dwell in the preserve, 
for it behoves one who loves tenderly like me to give 
greeting. 



THE TARJUMAN AL-ASHWAQ (IV) 


57 


2. And what harm to her if she gave me a greeting in 

return ? But fair women are subject to no authority. 

3. They journeyed when the darkness of night had let down 

its curtains, and I said to her, ‘ Pity a passionate 
lover, outcast and distraught, 

4. Whom desires eagerly encompass and at whom speeding 

arrows are aimed wheresoever he bends his course/ 

5. She displayed her front-teeth and a levin flashed, and 

I knew not which of the twain rent the gloom, 

(5. And she said, ‘ Is it not enough for him that I am in his 
heart and that he beholds me at every moment ? Is 
it not enough ? ’ 

Commentary 

1. ‘Salma’: he alludes to a Solomonic ecstasy (i’JU*. 

which descended upon him from the station of 
Solomon in virtue of a prophetic heritage. 

‘ In the preserve/ i.e. an unattainable station, viz. prophecy, 
whereof the gate was closed by Muhammad, the last of the 
prophets. Solomon’s experience of this Divine wisdom 

(£♦£»>) in so far as he was a prophet is different from his 
experience of it in so far as he was a saint, and we share it 
with him only in the latter case, since our experience of it 
is derived from the saintship which is the greatest circle 

2. God does nothing of necessity: whatever comes to us 
from Him is by His favour. The author indicates this 
Divine Solomonic apparition ( nulcta ) by the term ‘ marble 
statues ’ (i.e. women fair as marble statues). He means that 
she does not answer by speech, for if she did so her speech 
would be other than her essence, whereas her essence is 
single, so that her advent is identical with her speech and 
with her visible presence and with her hearing ; and in this 
respect all the Divine Realities and Attributes resemble her. 

3. ‘ They journeyed/ etc. : the ascension of the prophets 
always took place during the night, because night is the 
time of mystery and concealment. 



58 


THE TARJUMAN AL-ASHWAQ (iV, V) 


'The darkness of night/ i.e. the veil of the Unseen let 
down the curtains of gross corporeal existence, which is the 
night of this animal organism, throwing a shroud over the 
spiritual subtleties and noble sciences which it enshrines. 
These, however, are not to be reached except by journeying 
through bodily actions and sensual thoughts, and whilst 
a man is thus occupied the Divine wisdom goes away from 
his heart, so that on his return he finds her gone and follows 
her with his aspiration. 

4. 'Speeding arrows*: he describes this celestial form as 
shooting his heart, wherever it turns, with the arrows of her 
glances, as God said, ' Wheresoever ye turn, there is the face 
of Allah * (Kor. ii, 109). 

5. ‘ She displayed her front-teeth/ etc., i.e. this lover found 
his whole being illuminated, for ' God is the light of the 
heavens and the earth * (Kor. xxiv, 35), and the Prophet 
also said in his prayer, ' 0 God, put a light into my ear and 
into my eye/ and after mentioning the different members of 
his body he concluded, ‘ and make the whole of me one 
light/ viz. by the manifestation of Thy essence. Such a 
manifestation is compared to a flash of lightning on accoun.t 
of its not continuing. The author says that ’ he did not 
know whether his being was illuminated by the manifestation 
proceeding from this Divine wisdom, which smiled upon him, 
or by a simultaneous manifestation of the Divine Essence. 

6. ' She said/ etc., i.e. let him not seek me from without 
and let it satisfy him that I have descended into his heart, 
so that he beholds me in his essence and through his essence 
at every moment. 


Y 

1. My longing sought the Upland and my affliction Jbhe 

Lowland, so that I was between Najd and TihAma. 

2. They are two contraries which cannot meet: hence my 

disunion will never be repaired. 

3. What am I to do ? What shall I devise ? Guide me 

0 my censor, do not affright me with blame ! 



THE TARJUMAN AL-ASHWAQ (V) 59 

4. Sighs have risen aloft and tears are pouring over my 

cheeks. 

5. The camels, footsore from the journey, long for their 

homes and utter the plaintive cry of the frenzied 
lover. 

6. After they have gone, my life is naught but annihilation. 

Farewell to it and to patience ! 


Commentary 

1. 'The Upland/ referring to God on His throne. 

2. ‘ They are two contraries/ etc. : he says, ' Inasmuch as 
the spiritual element in man is always governing the body, 
it can never contemplate that which is uncomposed apart 
from its body and independently, as some Sufis and 
philosophers and ignorant persons declare.’ Hence the 
writer says, ' my disunion will never be repaired/ i.e., 

' I cannot become united with Him who is pure and simple, 
and who resembles my essence and reality. Therefore 
longing is folly, for this station is unattainable, but longing 
is a necessary attribute of love, and accordingly I cease not 
from longing.’ 

3. ‘ My censor,’ i.e. the blaming soul 

5. ' The camels/ i.e. the actions or the lofty thoughts 

— since, in my opinion, such thoughts belong to the 

class of actions — on which the good words 
mount to the throne of God. They ' long for their homes 
i.e. for the Divine Names from which they proceeded and by 
which they are controlled. 

6. 'My life is naught but annihilation’ : he says, 'When 

the lofty thoughts ascend to their goal I remain in the state 
of passing away from passing away ^ 'UilO, for 

I have gained the life imperishable which is not followed 
by any opposite.’ Accordingly, he bids farewell to patience 
and to the mortal life, because he has quitted the sensible 
world.

1. When they departed, endurance and patience departed. 

They departed, although they were dwelling in the 
core of my heart. 

2. I asked them where the travellers rested at noon, and 

I was answered, ‘ Their noonday resting-place is where 
the shih and the bdn trees diffuse a sweet scent.’ 

3. Then I said to the wind, 4 Go and overtake them, for they 

are biding in the shade of the grove, 

4. And bear to them a greeting from a sorrowful man in 

whose heart are sorrows because he is separated from 
his people.’ 


Commentary 

1. 4 They departed,’ i.e. the Divine Ideas (ifjbSSl Jc 

4 They were dwelling in the core of my heart ’ : the Divine 
Ideas have no relationship except with their object laxJl 
<u!\), which is God ; and God dwells in the heart, according 
to the Tradition ‘ Neither My earth nor My heaven contains 
Me, but I am contained in the heart of My servant who 
believes ’. Since, however, no manifestation was vouchsafed 
to him at this moment, the Ideas, being objects of vision, 
disappeared, notwithstanding that God was in his heart. 

2. ‘ I asked them,’ i.e. the gnostics and the real existences 

(^IjL*-) of the past Shaykhs who were my guides on the 
mystic Way. 

4 Their noonday resting-place,’ etc., i.e. they reposed in 
every heart where the sighs (^U^) of longing appeared, for 
shih denotes inclination ( mayl ) and bdn absence ( bu‘d ). 

3. ‘ I said to the wind,’ i.e. I sent a sigh of longing after 
them in the hope of causing them to return to me. 

c In the shade of the grove,’ i.e. amongst the ardk trees, 

whereof the wood is used as a tooth-stick He 

refers to the Tradition * The use of the tooth-stick purifies 
the mouth and pleases the Lord ’, i.e. the Divine Ideas are 
dwelling in the abode of purity.

1. As I kissed the Black Stone, friendly women thronged 

around me ; they came to perform the circum- 
ambulation with veiled faces. 

2. They uncovered the (faces like) sunbeams and said to me, 

‘ Beware ! for the death of the soul is in thy looking 
at us. 

3. How many aspiring souls have we killed already at 

al-Muhassab of Mina, beside the pebble-heaps, 

4. And in Sarhat al-W&di and the mountains of Rdma and 

Jam 1 and at the dispersion from ‘Araf&t !

and therefore it is called the robber of virtues ? 

6. Our trysting-place after the circumambulation is at 

Zamzam beside the midmost tent, beside the rocks. 

7. There everyone whom anguish hath emaciated is restored 

to health by the love-desire that perfumed women

‘ Those who swear fealty to thee swear fealty to God ; the 
hand of God is over their hands ’ (Kor. xlviii, 10). 

‘ Friendly women/ i.e. the angels who go round the throne 
of God (Kor. xxxix, 75). 

2. ‘ The death of the soul/ etc. : these spirits say, 4 Do not 

look at us, lest thou fall passionately in love with us. Thou 
wert created for God, not for us, and if thou wilt be veiled 
by us from Him, He will cause thee to pass away from thy 
existence through Him (& and thou 

wilt perish/ 

3. ‘ Have we killed/ i.e. spirits like unto us, for the 



62 


THE TARJUMAN AL-ASHWAQ (VIl) 


above-mentioned angels who go round the Throne have no 
relationship except with pilgrims circumambulating the Ka‘ba. 

5. ‘ Beauty robs him who hath modesty,’ since the vision 
of Beauty enraptures whosoever beholds it. 

‘ The robber of virtues,’ i.e. it takes away all delight in the 
vision of beauty from him who acts at the bidding of the 
possessor of this beauty ; and sometimes the beauteous one 
bids thee do that which stands between thee and glorious 
things, inasmuch as those things are gained by means of 
hateful actions : the Tradition declares that Paradise is 

encompassed by things which thou dislikest 

6. * At Zamzam,’ i.e. in the station of the life which thou 
yearnest for. 

‘ Beside the midmost tent,’ i.e. the intermediate world 
which divides the spiritual from the corporeal 

world. 

‘ Beside the rocks,’ i.e. the sensible bodies in which the 
holy spiritual beings take their abode. He 

means that these spirits in these imaginary forms are 
metaphorical and transient, for they vanish from the dreamer 
as soon as he wakes and from the seer as soon as he return's 
to his senses. He warns thee not to be deceived by the 
manifestations of phenomenal beauty, inasmuch as all save 
God is unreal, i.e. not-being like unto thyself ; therefore be 
His that He may be thine. 

7. In the intermediate world whosoever loves these 

spiritual beings dwelling in sensible bodies derives refresh- 
ment from the world of breaths and scents ^Jlc) 

because the spirit and the form are there united, so that the 
delight is double. 

8. When these phantoms are afraid that their absoluteness 
will be limited by their confinement in forms, they cause 
thee to perceive that they are a veil which hides something 
more subtle than what thou seest, and conceal themselves 
from thee and quit these forms and once more enjoy infinite 
freedom.

1. Their abodes have become decayed, but desire of them is 

ever new in my heart and decayeth not. 

2. These tears are shed over their ruined dwellings, but souls 

are ever melted at the memory of them. 

3. Through love of them I called out behind their riding- 

camels, ‘ O ye who are rich in beauty, here am I, 
a beggar ! 

4. I have rolled my cheek in the dust in tender and passionate 

affection : then, by the true love which I owe to you, 
do not make hopeless 

5. One who is drowned in his tears and burned in the fire of 

sorrow with no respite ! ’ 

6. 0 thou who wouldst kindle a fire, be not hasty ! Here is 

the fire of passion. Go and take of it ! 

Commentary 

1. ‘Their abodes have become decayed’: he says, ‘the 
places of austerities and mortifications, where the Divine 
Names made works their abode, have become decayed 

through age and loss of youthful strength.’ The word 

is used in reference to the springtide /J ) of human life. 

3. ‘ Behind their riding-camels,’ i.e. the powers of youth 
and the delights of the commencement (ijljJI). 

4. ‘ I have rolled my cheek in the dust,’ i.e. desiring 
to be united with you, for God says, ‘Seek access to Me 
by means of that which I have not,’ viz. abasement and 
indigence. 

6. ‘ Here is the fire of passion,’ i.e. in my heart.

1. Flashes of lightning gleamed to us at al-Abraq^n, and 

their peals of thunder crashed between the ribs. 

2. Their clouds poured rain on every meadow and on every 

quivering branch that bends towards thee. 

3. The watercourses were flooded and the breeze wafted 



64 


THE TARJUMAN AL-ASKWAQ (IX) 


perfume, and a ringdove flapped her wings and a twig 
put forth leaves. 

4. They pitched the red tents between rivulets (creeping) like 

serpents, amongst which were seated 

5. Friendly damsels, bright of countenance, rising like the 

suns, large- eyed, noble, of generous race, and limber. 

Commentary 

1. ‘Al-Abraqan/ i.e. two manifestations of the Essence, one 
in the unseen and one in the visible world. 

* Flashes of lightning/ referring to the variety of forms in 
the latter manifestation. 

‘ Peals of thunder/ i.e. the Divine converse 

' • 

which followed the manifestation. This is a Mosaic ecstasy 
(aj f° r Moses first saw the fire and afterwards 
heard God speak. The mention of thunder also signifies that 
God’s speech was a rebuke. 

2. ‘Their clouds/ i.e. the ecstasies (Jl.^/) which bring 
forth the Divine sciences. 

‘ On every meadow/ i.e. the heart of man together with 
the Divine sciences which it holds. 

‘ On every quivering branch/ i.e. the straight movement 

which is the growth of man iftfij), 

as God says that He created Adam after His own image ; and 
from this station it * bends i.e. inclines towards thee that it 
may instruct thee. 

3. He says, ‘ The valleys of the Divine sciences were 

flooded, and the world of breaths jjLc) diffused the 

sweet scents of the Divine sciences/ 

‘A ringdove/ i.e. the Universal Soul together with the 
effect it produces upon the Partial Soul, which appears in 
the form of the Universal in so far as it possesses the two 
faculties of knowledge and action. 

‘A twig/ i.e. that with which the branches are clothed. 
He refers to the verse ‘ Take your becoming vesture at every 
mosque 9 (Kor. vii, 29), i.e. the everlasting vesture of God, 
which consists in the various kinds of Divine science and gnosis. 



THE TARJUMAN AL-ASHWAQ (iX, X) 65 

4. ‘The red tents/ i.e. the bride-like forms of Divine 
wisdom. 

f Rivulets/ i.e. diverse sciences connected with the works 
which lead to union with these forms of Divine wisdom. 

‘Like serpents’ : cf. Kor. xxiv, 44, ‘ And amongst them is one 
xuho walks on his belly .’ He refers to those devout persons 
who scrupulously examine their food, for by means of pure 
food which produces strength for the practice of devotion 
the heart is illuminated and becomes the abode of these forms 
of Divine wisdom. 

5. ‘ Bright of countenance/ etc., i.e. there is no doubt 
concerning them, as the Prophet said, ‘ Ye shall see your 
Lord as ye see the sun at noonday when no cloud comes 
between.’ 

‘ Noble/ i.e. proceeding from the results of works prescribed 
by God, unlike the maxims of the philosophers which spring 
from their own minds. 

‘ Of generous race ’ : diLjLi is derived from jjfe. He means, 
therefore, that they understand what is imparted to them and 
perceive its value. 

‘ Limber ’ : although per se they are in the station of 
equilibrium* and inflexibility, yet when they are invoked 
with longing and humility and love they incline towards the 
caller, because he is not able to ascend to them.

1. She said, ‘ I wonder at a lover who in conceit of his merits 

walks proudly among flowers in a garden.’ 

2. I replied, ‘ Do not wonder at what thou seest, for thou 

hast beheld thyself in the mirror of a man.’ 


Commentary 


1. ‘ Flowers,’ i.e. created things. 

‘A garden/ the unitive station (^Ish he. his essence. 

‘Utba al-Ghulam used to walk proudly and swagger in his 
gait. ‘ How should not I do so,’ he said to one who found 
fault with him, ‘ since He has become my Lord and I have 



66 


THE TARJUMAN AL-ASHWAQ (X, Xl) 


become His slave ? * When a man realizes God in the sense 
of ‘ I am His hearing and His sight ’, this station justifies the 
attribution to him of whatever is attributed to God. 

2. He says, ‘I am like a mirror to thee, and in those 
qualities with which I am invested thou beholdest thyself, 
not me, but thou beholdest them in my human nature which 
has received this investiture.’ 

This is the vision of God in created things, which in the 
opinion of some is more exalted than the vision of created 
things in God.

1. O doves that haunt the a rdh and ban trees, have pity ! 

Do not double my woes by your lamentation ! 

2. Have pity ! Do not reveal, by wailing and weeping, my 

hidden desires and my secret sorrows ! 

3. I respond to her, at eve and morn, with the plaintive cry 

of a longing man and the moan of an impassioned 
lover. 

4. The spirits faced one another in the thicket of ghadd 

trees and bent their branches towards me, and it (the 
bending) annihilated me ; 

5. And they brought me divers sorts of tormenting desire 

and passion and untried affliction. 

6. Who will give me sure promise of Jam‘ and al-Muhassab 

of Mind ? Who of Dhdt al-Athl ? Who of Na'man ? 

7. They encompass my heart moment after moment, for the 

sake of love and anguish, and kiss my pillars, 

8. Even as the best of mankind encompassed the Ka‘ba, 

which the evidence of Reason proclaims to be 
imperfect, 

9. And kissed stones therein, although he was a Natiq 

(prophet). 1 And what is the rank of the Temple in 
comparison with the dignity of Man ? 

1 In the Isma'lli system Muhammad, regarded as an incarnation of 
Universal Reason, is the Ndtiq of the sixth prophetic cycle. See Professor 
Browne’s Literary History of Persia, i, 408 seq.

10. How often did they vow and swear that they would not 

change, but one dyed with henna does not keep oaths. 

11. And one of the most wonderful things is a veiled 

gazelle, who points with red finger-tip and winks 
with eyelids, 

12. A gazelle whose pasture is between the breast-bones and 

the bowels. O marvel ! a garden amidst fires ! 

13. My heart has become capable of every form : it is a 

pasture for gazelles and a convent for Christian monks, 

14. And a temple for idols and the pilgrim's Ka‘ba and the 

tables of the Tora and the book of the Koran. 

15. I follow the religion of Love : whatever way Love's 

camels take, that is my religion and my faith. 

16. We have a pattern in Bishr, the lover of Hind and her 

sister, and in Qays and Lubnd and in Mayya and 
Ghayl&n. 


Commentary 

1. ‘ O doves,' i.e. the influences of holiness and purity. 

3. ‘ I respond to her,’ i.e. I repeat to her what she says to 
me, as God said to the soul when He created her, ‘ Who am 
I ? ' and she answered, ‘ Who am I ? ’ referring to her 
qualities, whereupon He caused her to dwell four thousand 
years in the sea of despair and indigence and abasement 
until she said to Him, ‘ Thou art my Lord.' 

4. ‘ Faced one another,' because love entails the union of 
two opposites. 

4 In the thicket of ghadd trees,' i.e. the fires of love. 

‘ Branches,' i.e. flames. 

‘ Annihilated me,' in order that He alone might exist, not 
I, through jealousy that the lover should have any existence 
in himself apart from his beloved. 

6. * Jam*,' i.e. union with the loved ones in the station of 
proximity, which is al-Muzdalifa. 

‘Al-Mubassab,' the place where the thoughts which prevent 
lovers from attaining their object of desire are cast out. 

* Dh&t al-Athl,' referring to the principle ( for it is 



68 


THE TARJUMAN AL-ASHWAQ (Xl) 


the principle in love that thou shouldst be the very essence 
of thy Beloved and shouldst disappear in Him from thyself. 

‘ Na‘m&n/ the place of Divine and holy bliss (^*3). 

7. ‘ For the sake of love and anguish/ i.e. in order to 
inspire me with passion. 

‘ And kiss my pillars ’ (properly, kiss over the lith&rn or 
veil covering the mouth), i.e. he is veiled and unable to 
behold them except through a medium (*k«»U). The 4 pillars * 
are the four elements on which the human constitution is 
based. 1 

10. ‘One dyed with henna’: he refers to sensual influences 

such as descended on the soul when God 

•• ✓ v 

addressed it and said, ‘ Am not I your Lord ? ’ (Kor. vii, 171), 
and received from it a promise and covenant. Then it did 
not faithfully keep the station of unification (j^y:H), but 
followed other gods. No one was exempt from this poly- 
theism, for every one said, ‘ I did ’ and ‘ I said ’, at the time 
when he forgot to contemplate the Divine Agent and Speaker 
within him. 

11. ‘A veiled gazelle/ i.e. a Divine subtlety (iLk!) veiled 

by a sensual state (iiLJjj <3U-), in reference to the unknown 
spiritual feelings of gnostics, who cannot explain 

their feelings to other men ; they can only indicate them 
symbolically to those who have begun to experience the like. 

‘ With red finger-tip ’ : he means the same thing as he 
meant by ‘ one dyed with henna ’ in the last verse. 

‘And winks with eyelids/ i.e. the speculative proofs 
concerning the principles of gnostics are valid only for 
those who have already been imbued with the rudiments 
of this experience. Gnostics, though they resemble the 
vulgar outwardly, are Divines (^2 Ijl? ,) inwardly. 

12. ‘Whose pasture/ etc., as ‘All said, striking his breast, 
‘ Here are sciences in plenty, could I but find people to carry 
them (in their minds)/ 

1 The author leaves the next two verses unexplained. ‘ The best of 
mankind’ is Muhammad. 



THE TARJUMAN AL-ASHWAQ (Xl) 


09 


‘A garden amidst fires/ i.e. manifold sciences which, 
strange to say, are not consumed by the flames of love 
in his breast. The reason is, that these sciences are 
produced by the fires of seeking and longing, and therefore, 
like the salamander, are not destroyed by them. 

13. 4 My heart has become capable of every form/ as 

another has said, 'The heart is so called from its 

changing (a* 1&’)/ for it varies according to the various 
influences by which it is affected in consequence of the 
variety of: its states of feeling (JL»*\); an d variety 
of its feelings is due to the variety of the Divine 
manifestations that appear to its inmost ground The 

religious law gives to this phenomenon the name of 
4 transformation ’ ^ J Susllj JjfsSjl). 

‘ A pasture for gazelles/ i.e. for the objects of his love. 

‘ A convent for Christian monks ’ : inasmuch as he makes 
the loved ones to be monks, he calls the heart a convent. 

14. ‘A temple for idols,’ i.e. for the Divine Realities which 
men seek and for whose sake they worship God. 

‘ The pilgrim’s Ka‘ba,’ because his heart is encompassed by 
exalted spirits. 

‘ The tables of the Tora,’ i.e. his heart is a table on which 
are inscribed the Mosaic sciences that have accrued to him. 

‘ The book of the Koran,’ because his heart has received an 
inheritance of the perfect Muhammadan knowledge. 

15. 4 1 follow the religion of Love/ in reference to the verse 
: Follow me, then God will love you ’ (Kor. iii, 29). 

‘ Whatever way Love’s camels take/ etc., i.e. 4 1 accept 
willingly and gladly whatever burden He lays upon me. 
No religion is more sublime than a religion based on love 
and longing for Him whom I worship and in whom I have 
faith’. This is a peculiar prerogative of Moslems, for the 
station of perfect love is appropriated to Muhammad beyond 
any other prophet, since God took him as His beloved 

16. He says, 4 Love, qud love, is one and the same reality 
to those Arab lovers and to me, but the objects of our love 



70 


THE TARJUMAN AL-ASHWAQ (XI, XIl) 


are different, for they loved a phenomenon, whereas I love the 
Essential/ ‘ We have a pattern in them/ because God only 
afflicted them with love for human beings like themselves 
in order that He might show, by means of them, the falseness 
of those who pretend to love Him and yet feel no such 
transport and rapture in loving Him as deprived those 
enamoured men of their reason and made them unconscious 
of themselves.

1. At Dhii Salam and the monastery in the abode of al-Him& 

are gazelles who show thee the sun in the forms of 
marble statues. 

2. Therefore I watch spheres and serve in a church and guard 

a many-coloured meadow in the spring. 

3. And at one time I am called the herdsman of the gazelles 

in the desert, and at another time I am called a 
Christian monk and an astrologer. 

4. My Beloved is three although He is One, even as the 

(three) Persons (of the Trinity) are made one Person 
in essence. 

« 

5. So be not displeased, 0 friend, that I speak of gazelles 

that move round the marble statues as 4 a shining sun*, 

6. Or that I use metaphorically the necks of the gazelles, 

the face of the sun, and the breast and wrist of the 
white statue, 

7. Just as I have lent to the branches (spiritual) endowments 

and to the meadows moral qualities, and to the 
lightning laughing lips. 

Commentary 

1. ‘Dhii Salam ’ : a station to which submission is rendered 
on account of its beauty. 

‘The monastery/ referring to a Syrian ecstasy (<3U* 
SSj\j j+). 

‘ The abode of al-Himd/ that which surrounds the most 
inaccessible veil of Divine glory. 



THE TARJUMAN AL-ASHWAQ (XIl) 


71 


‘Gazelles/ i.e. forms of Divine and prophetic wisdom 
which descend upon his spirit. 

‘ Marble statues/ i.e. sorts of knowledge (uJjU/#) with 
which neither reason nor lust is connected ; hence he makes 
them inanimate 

2. ‘ I watch spheres/ i.e. the spiritual states in which 
these sorts of knowledge revolve, like the sun. 

‘ And serve in a church/ because marble effigies are found 
in churches. 

‘And guard/ etc. : the meadows where these gazelles 
pasture are the scenes of devotional acts and Divine morals ; 
they are described as ‘ many-coloured i.e. adorned with the 
Divine realities, and spring-like, because that which is new 
and fresh is more delightful to the soul. 

3. He refers to his ever-changing spiritual states, which 
bring with them manifold Divine influences and sciences. 
Although the spiritual experiences vary, the Divine substance 

remains one. This is the ‘transformation 

of which Muslim speaks in the chapter on Faith, 
Those who worship God in the sun behold a sun, and those 
\Vho worship Him in living things see a living thing, and 
those who worship Him in inanimate objects see an inanimate 
object, and those who worship Him as a Being unique and 
unparalleled see that which has no like. 

4. He says, ‘ Number does not beget multiplicity in the 
Divine substance, as the Christians declare that the Three 
Persons of the Trinity are One God, and as the Koran 
declares (xvii, 110) : “ Gall on God or call on the Merciful; 
howsoever ye invoke Him , it is well , for to Him belong the 
most excellent Names.” ’ The cardinal Names in the Koran 
are three, viz. Allah and ar-Rahm&n and ar-Rabb, by which 
One God is signified, and the rest of the Names serve as 
epithets of those three. 

6. ‘Necks/ indicating the Light as the Tradition 

‘ The muezzins shall be the longest-necked of mankind on the 
Day of Resurrection \ 



72 


THE TARJUMAN AL-ASHWAQ (XII, XIIl) 


1 The face of the sun/ as in the Tradition ‘ Ye shall see 
your Lord as ye see the sun \ 

‘The breast and wrist of the white statue/ as in the 
Tradition which mentions the breast and fore-arm of the 
Almighty. 

7. ‘ The branches/ i.e. the souls distraught by the majesty 
of God and turned away by love from the consciousness of 
their personality and from the contemplation of their 
phenomenal nature. 

‘The meadow/ i.e. the station of union ^liU) in 

which God has placed them. 

‘ Moral qualities/ i.e. the scented breaths of Divine Mercy, 
viz. the goodly praise of the kind mentioned in 

the Tradition ‘ Even as Thou dost praise Thyself’. 

‘ The lightning/ i.e. a manifestation of the Divine Essence. 

‘ Laughing lips/ as God is said in the Tradition to rejoice 
at the repentance of His servant, or to laugh <d!\).

1. A ringdove wailed and a sad lover complained, and lie was 

grieved by her trilling note and complaint. 

2. Tears flowed from their eyes in distress for her complaint, 

and ’twas as tho’ they (the tears) were fountains. 

3. I responded to her in the bereavement caused by the loss 

of her only child : one who loses an only child is 
bereaved indeed. 

4. I responded to her, while Grief walked between us ; she 

was invisible, but I was clearly seen. 

5. In me is a burning desire, from love of the sandy tract of 

9 

‘Alij, where her tents are and the large-eyed maidens, 

6. With murderous glances, languishing : their eyelids are 

sheaths for glances like swords. 

7. I did not cease to swallow the tears proceeding from my 

malady and to conceal and guard my passion from 
those who blame me, 

8. Until, when the raven’s croak announced their departure, 

separation exposed the desire of a sorrow-stricken lover. 



THE TARJUMAN AL-ASHWAQ (XIIl) 



9. They journeyed continuously through the night, they cut 
the nose-rings of their camels, so that they (the 
camels) moaned and cried under the litters. 

10. I beheld the pangs of death at the time when they loosed 

the camels’ reins and tied their saddle-girths. 

11. Oh! separation together with love’s pain is mortal, but 

love’s sorest pain together with meeting is light. 

12. None blames me for desiring her, for she is beloved and 

beautiful wherever she may be. 


Commentary 


1. ‘A ringdove,’ i.e. the Universal Spirit, born of God and 
breathed into Man. She is described as having a collar 
(ring), in reference to the covenant which He laid upon her. 

‘ A sad lover,’ i.e. the partial spirit which is in Man. 

‘ Her trilling note,’ i.e. the sweet melodies calling him to 
union with her. This union is the first resurrection at 
death J p\ ^ )• 

2. ‘From their eyes’: he refers to the partial spirits 

‘ Her complaint ’ : the Universal Spirit, which 
is the father of the partial spirits, longs for them even more 
than they long for her. 

3. ‘ Her only child,’ i.e. the special quality which dis- 
tinguishes her from all things else, viz. her unity 


whereby she knows the unity of Him who brought her 
into being. The loss of it consists in her not knowing what 
it is and in its not being plainly discerned by her. 

4. ‘ She was invisible,’ for she does not belong to the world 
of expression and exposition. 

5. ‘The sandy tract of ‘Alij,’ i.e. the subtleties of the 
acquired or analytic sciences. ‘Alij refers to the striving 
after good works ( £s!U*). 

‘ Her tents,’ the veils which conceal these sciences. 

‘ The large-eyed maidens,’ i.e. the sciences which descend 
upon the solitary recluse. 

6. ‘With murderous glances,’ i.e. they cause him to pass 
away from his own personality. 



74 


THE TARJUMAN AL-ASHWAQ (XIII, XIV) 


‘ Languishing/ i.e. they incline towards the solitary. The 
term ‘ glances ’ indicates that they are sciences of contemplation 
and revelation, not of faith and mystery, and that they 
proceed from the manifestation of forms. 

7 . He refers to a state of concealment which is characteristic 
of the Malamatis. 1 

9 . 4 They journeyed continuously ’ : since the object sought 
is infinite, the return from it is also a journey towards it. 
Th$re is no migration except from one Divine Name to 
another. 

‘ They cut the nose-rings of their camels/ on account of 
the violent haste with which they travelled. 

11 . 'Meeting/ a kind of presence (,4*3^) in which there is 
no passing away ('Ui). 

12. He says, c The aspirations and desires of all seekers are 
attached to Her, yet She is essentially unknown to them 
hence they all love Her, yet none blames another for loving* 
Her. Similarly, every individual soul and the adherents of 
every religion seek salvation, but since they do not know 
it they are also ignorant of the way that leads to it, though 
everyone believes that he is on the right way. All strife 
between people of different religions and sects is about the 
way that leads to salvation, not about salvation itself. 
If anyone knew that he was taking the wrong way, he 
would not persevere in his error.’ Accordingly the author 
says that She manifests Herself everywhere, like the sun, 
and that every person who beholds Her deems that She is 
with him in Her essence, so that envy and jealousy are 
removed from their hearts.

east, but if it had flashed in the west he would have 
longed for the west.

( maldmat ) for God’s sake and of concealing spiritual merit, lest they should

2. My desire is for the lightning and its gleam, not for the 

places and the earth. 

3. The east wind related to me from them a tradition handed 

down successively from distracted thoughts, from my 
passion, from anguish, from my tribulation, 

4. From rapture, from my reason, from yearning, from ardour, 

from tears, from my eyelid, from fire, from my heart, 

5. That ‘ He whom thou lovest is between thy ribs ; the 

breaths toss him from side to side \ 

6. I said to the east wind, * Bring a message to him and say 

that he is the enkindler of the fire within my heart. 

7. If it shall be quenched, then everlasting union, and if 

it shall burn, then no blame to the lover ! ’ 

Commentary 

1. He refers to the vision of God in created things, viz. the 
manifestation in forms, and this causes him to cleave to 
phenomena, because the manifestation appears in them. 

‘ The east/ i.e. the place of phenomenal manifestation. 

‘ If it had flashed in the west/ i.e. if it had been a mani- 
festation of the Divine essence to the lovers heart, he would 
have longed for that purer manifestation in the world of 
purity and mystery. 

2. He says, ‘ I desire the forms in which the manifestation 
takes place only in so far as they are a locus for the mani- 
festation itself/ 

3. The world of breaths jJU) communicated to me 

the inward meaning of these phenomenal forms. 

4. * Rapture ’ (literally, 4 intoxication/ jSiL ) : the fourth 
degree in the manifestations. The first degree is the 
second i-Jy* , and the third . 

‘ From my reason/ because intoxication transports the 
reason and takes away from it whatever it has. 

5. ‘ The breaths/ etc., i.e. the overwhelming awe inspired by 
this manifestation produces in him various ecstasies 

7. He says, f If the awful might of this manifestation 
shall be veiled through the permanence of the Divine

THE TARJUMAN AL-ASHWAQ (XIV, XV) 


substance, then the union will be lasting ; but if the mani- 
festation be unchecked, it will sweep away all that exists 
in its locus , and those who perish are not in fault;' This is 
the saying of one possessed and mastered by ecstasy.

1. They left me at al-Uthayl and al-Naqd shedding tears 

and complaining of the fire (that consumed me). 

2. My father be the ransom of him for whose sake I melted 

with anguish ! My father be the ransom of him for 
whose sake I died of fear ! 

3. The blush of shame on his cheek is the whiteness of dawn 

conversing with the redness of eve. 

4. Patience decamped and grief pitched tents, and I lie 

prostrate between these two. 

5. Who will compose my distracted thoughts ? Who will 

relieve my pain ? Guide me to him ! Who will ease 
my sorrow ? Who will help a passionate lover ? 

6. Whenever I keep secret the torments of desire, my tears 

betray the flame within and the sleeplessness. 

7. And whenever I say, ‘ Give me one look ! ’ the answer is, 

‘ Thou art not hindered but for pity’s sake.’ 

8. It cannot be that one look from them will avail thee. Is 

it aught but the glimpse of a levin that flashed ? 

9. I am not forgetting the time when the camel-driver, 

wishing for separation and seeking al-Abraq, ui’ged 
them on. 

10. The ravens of separation croaked at them — may God not 

preserve a raven that croaked ! 

11. The raven of separation is only a camel which carried 

away the loved ones with a swift wide-stepping pace. 

Commentary 

1. He laments the departure of his companions, viz. the 
spiritual angelic beings who suffer no natural bondage, whilst 
he is left a prisoner in this body, occupied with governing it 
and prevented from wandering freely through the celestial 
spheres.

is his real father in the world above and his phenomenal 
mother in the world below. 

‘ Of him for whose sake I melted with anguish 9 : he refers 
to the Divine mystery contained in his heart. 

‘ Of fear/ i.e. fear of the radiance of the Divine majesty. 

6. The love that is revealed is stronger and more passionate, 
for there is no good in a love that is ruled by reason. 

7. God in His mercy veils the splendours of His face from 
His creatures. . 

8. The more the Beloved looks on thee, the more is thy 
anguish increased. Vision is possible only in moments of 
ecstasy.

exalted spiritual beings to ascend towards Him. 

‘ Separation/ i.e. their departure from the phenomenal 
world. 

‘ Al-Abraq/ the place where God is manifested in His 


essence. 


10. ‘ The ravens of separation/ i.e. considerations affecting 
his phenomenal existence, which hinder him from the 
ascent to God. 


11. ‘A camel/ i.e. the ravens of separation are really 
a man’s aspirations (**.&), since aspiration bears him aloft

1. They (the women) mounted the howdahs on the swift 

camels and placed in them the (damsels like) marble 
statues and full moons,

4. When she turned her back with the purpose of making 

for al-Khawarnaq and as-Sadir, 

5. I cried out after them, ‘ Perdition ! ’ She answered and 

said, ‘ Dost thou invoke perdition ? 

6. Then invoke it not only once, but cry “ Perdition ! ” many 

times.’ 

7. O dove of the ardk trees, have a little pity on me ! for 

parting only increased thy moans, 

8. And thy lamentation, O dove, inflames the longing lover, 

excites the jealous, 

9. Melts the heart, drives off sleep, and doubles our desires 

and sighing. 

10. Death hovers because of the dove’s lamentation, and we 

beg him to spare us a little while, 

11. That perchance a breath from the zephyr of H&jir may 

sweep towards us rain-clouds, 

12. By means of which thou wilt satisfy thirsty souls; but 

thy clouds only flee farther than before.

wouldst have gained, through her, happiness and joy, 

16. Giving to the fair (women) the wines of intimacy, con- 

versing secretly with the suns, and flattering the full 
moons. 

Commentary 

1. ‘ The camels ’ are the human faculties, ‘ the howdahs ’ 
are the actions which they are charged to perform, ‘the 
damsels’ in the howdahs are the mystical sciences and the 
perfect sorts of knowledge. 

3. He says, ‘ This Divine subtlety, being acquired and not 
given directly, is subject to a change produced by contact 
with phenomena ’ ; this change he indicates by speaking of 
her henna-tipped fingers as though it were the modification 



rfi’iT TARJUMAN AL-ASHWAQ (XVl) 7 9 

of unity by a kind of association Nevertheless, 

her staying in the heart is more desirable than her going, for 
she protects the gnostic as long as she is there. 

‘ And let fall tears,’ etc. : she let loose in the heart sciences 
of contemplation which produced an intense yearning. 

4. ‘ Al-Khawarnaq and as-Sadir,’ i.e. the Divine presence. 

5. ‘ Perdition ! ’ i.e. death to the phenomenal world now 
that these sublime mysteries have vanished from it. 

‘ Dost thou invoke perdition ? ’ i.e. why dost thou not see 
the face of God in everything, in light and darkness, in 
simple and composite, in subtle and gross, in order that thou 
mayst not feel the grief of parting. 

6. ‘Cry “Perdition!” many times’ (cf. Kor. xxv, 15), 

i.e. not only in this station but in every station in which 
thou art placed, for thou must bid farewell to every one of 
them, and thou canst not fail to be grieved, since, whenever 
the form of the Truth disappears from thee, thou imaginest 
that He has left thee ; but He has not left thee, and it is 
only thy remaining with thyself that veils 

from thee the vision of that which pervades the whole of 
creation. 

* 7. ‘0 dove of the ardlc trees’: he addresses holy influences 
of Divine pleasure which have descended upon him. 

4 Have a little pity on me ! ’ i.e. pity my weakness and 
inability to attain unto thy purity. 

‘For parting only increased thy moans’: he says, ‘Inasmuch 
as thy substance only exists through and in me, and I am 
diverted from thee by the dark world of phenomena which 
keeps me in bondage, for this cause thou art lamenting thy 
separation from me.’ 

8. ‘ And thy lamentation,’ etc., i.e. we who seek the 
unbounded freedom of the celestial world should weep more 
bitterly than thou. 

‘ Excites the jealous ’ : jealousy arises from regarding 
others and he who beholds God in everything feels 

no jealousy, for God is One; but since God manifests Himself 
in various forms, the term ‘jealousy ’ is applicable to Him.

10. ‘Death/ i.e. the station in which the subtle principle 
of Man is severed from its governance of this dark body for 
the sake of the Divine subtleties which are conveyed to it by 
the above-mentioned holy influences. 

11. ‘Hajir’ denotes here the most inaccessible veil of 
the Divine glory. No phenomenal being can attain to the 
immediate experience thereof, but scents of it blow over the 
hearts of gnostics in virtue of a kind of amorous affection 


f Rain-clouds/ i.e. sciences and diverse sorts of knowledge 
belonging to the most holy Essence. 

13. ‘0 watcher of the star/ in reference to keeping in mind 
that which the sciences offer in their various connexions. 

‘ 0 wakeful spy on the lightning ’ : the lightning is a locus 
of manifestation of the Essence. The author says, addressing 
one who seeks it, ‘ Our quest is the same, be my comrade in 
the night/

(aliUll Jj&I) or to the unconscious j*i). 

15. ‘ The fond maiden/ i.e. the Essential subtlety which is 
the gnostic’s object of desire. 

‘ Through her ’ : although She is unattainable, yet through 
her manifestation to thee all that thou hast is baptized 

for thee and thy whole kingdom is displayed 

to thee by that Essential form. 

16. ‘ Conversing secretly witli the suns,’ etc., in reference 
to the Traditions which declare that God will be seen in the 
next world like the sun in a cloudless sky or like the moon 
when she is full.

1. 0 driver of the reddish- white camels, do not hasten with 

them, but stop ! for I am a cripple going after them. 

2. Stop the camels and tighten their reins ! I beseech thee 

by God, by my passion, by my anguish, O driver ! 

3. My soul is willing, but my foot does not second her. Who 

will pity and help me ?

4. What shall the skilled craftsman do in a case where his 

tools have declared themselves to be working mischief ? 

5. Turn aside, for their tents are on the right of the valley. 

God bless thee, 0 valley, for what thou containest ! 

6. Thou hast collected a folk who are my soul and my breath 

and the inmost core of the black clot in the membrane 
of my liver. 

7. May my love be unblest if I do not die of grief at H&jir or 

Sal f or Ajydd ! 


Commentary 

1. The Divine Spirit which speaks in Man and is charged 
with the governance of this body says to the camel-driver, 
i.e. to God’s summoner who guides the lofty aspirations in 
their journey heavenward, 4 Do not hasten with them, for 
I am hampered by this body to which I am tied until death.’ 

3. ‘ Who will pity and help me ? ’ He refers to the decree 

of God (jJdLb). 

4. He says, ‘ What shall I do ? Though I am able to quit 
the body at times, i.e. in moments of passing away and 

absence under the influence of ecstasy, my 

aim is to depart entirely ; and, moreover, at such moments 
the sensible world exercises a powerful attraction upon me. 
This attraction (here called “ his tools ”) spoils what I am 
endeavouring to do, and disturbs my state of passing away 
and absence in order to bring me back to the body.’ 

5. ‘ Their tents,’ i.e. the abodes of these aspirations, which 
are in their knowledge of God, not in God, since He is 
not a locus for anything. Knowledge of God is the utmost 
goal to which contingent being can attain, and the whole 
universe depends on knowledge and on nothing else. 

* On the right of the valley,’ referring to the occasion when 
God spoke to Moses at Mount Sinai (Kor. xix, 53). 

‘ What thou containest,’ i.e. Divine, holy, and Mosaic kinds 
of knowledge. 

7. * H&jir,’ i.e. the intermediate world 



82 


THE TARJUMAN AL-ASHWAQ (XVII, XVIIl) 


‘ Sal'/ a mountain near Medina, i.e. the station of 
Muhammad. 

‘Ajy&d,’ a mountain ne&r Mecca, i.e. a Divine station 
which causes me to pass away from all phenomenal existence.

1. Halt at the abodes and weep over the ruins and ask the 

decayed habitations a question. 

2. * Where are the loved ones ? Where are their camels gone ? * 

(They answer), ‘ Behold them traversing the vapour 
in the desert. 

3. Thou seest them in the mirage like gardens : the vapour 

makes large in the eyes the figure (of one who walks 
in it). 5 

4. They went, desiring al-‘Udhayb, that they might drink 

there a cool life-giving fountain. 

5. I followed, asking the zephyr about them, whether they 

have pitched tents or have sought the shade of the 
ddl tree. 

6. The zephyr said, ‘ I left their tents at Zarud, and the 

camels were complaining of fatigue from their night- 
journey. 

7. They had let down over the tents coverings to protect 

their beauty from the heat of noon. 

8. Rise, then, and go towards them, seeking their traces, and 

drive thy camels speedily in their direction. 

9. And when thou wilt stop at the landmarks of H&jir and 

cross dales and hills there, 

10. Their abodes will be near and their fire will be clearly 

seen — a fire which has caused the flame of love to 
blaze. 

11. Make the camels kneel ! Let not its lions affright thee, 

for longing love will present them to thine eyes in 
the form of cubs.’ 

Commentary 

1. He says to the voice of God ( ( jJ\ *'*>) calling from 

his heart, ‘ Halt at the abodes/ i.e. the stations where gnostics 



THE TARJUMAN AL-ASHWAQ (XVIIl) 


83 


alight in the course of their journey to infinite knowledge of 
their object of worship. 

‘ And weep over the ruins/ i.e. the traces left by those 
gnostics, since I cannot accompany them. 

‘ The decayed habitations/ because there is no joy in the 
abodes which have been deserted, and their very existence 
depends on those who dwell in them. 

2. ‘ Their camels/ i.e. their aspirations. 

‘ The vapour,’ i.e. the evidences (J jib) of that which they 
seek, for its evidences are attached to its being found in 
themselves. 

‘ The desert/ i.e. the station of abstraction (x 

3. ‘ Makes large/ i.e. they are grand because they give 
evidence of the grandeur of that which they seek. Hence it 
is said, ‘ In order that he who was not (namely, thou) may 
pass away, and He who never was not (namely, God) may 
subsist for ever/ And God said, ‘ Like a vapour in the 
plain (i.e. the station of humility) . . . when he cometh to 
it , he findeth it to be nothing, but he findeth God with him ’ 
(Kor. xxiv, 39), inasmuch as all secondary causes have been 
.cut off from him. Accordingly the author says that the 
vapour makes large, etc., meaning that Man’s superiority 
over all other contingent beings consists in his giving stronger 
evidence of God, since he is the most perfect organism, as the 
Prophet said, 'Verily he was created in the image of the 
Merciful/ 

4. ‘ Desiring al-'Udhayb,’ i.e. seeking the mystery of life 
in the station of purity from the fountain of liberality. 

‘ That they might drink ’ : shurb is the second degree of 
Divine manifestation ( J^sXJl), dhawq being the first. 

5. ‘ Whether they have pitched tents/ referring to know- 
ledge acquired by them. 

‘ Or have sought the shade of the ddl tree/ referring to 
knowledge divinely bestowed, in which their actions have no 
part. J)dl implies bewilderment (S^»-).

much as sand is often tossed by the wind from one place

THE TARJUMAN AL-ASHWAQ (XVIII, XIX) 


to another, he indicates that they are in a state of unrest, 
because they are seeking that which is unimaginable, and of 
which only the traces are to be found in the soul. 

7. * Coverings to . protect their beauty,’ i.e. unless their 
faces, viz. their realities, were veiled, the intense radiance of 
this station would consume them. 

8. 4 Seeking their traces ’ : he says, ‘ Seek to approach the 
degree of the prophets with thy aspiration (this he indicates 
by the word “ camels ”), but not by immediate experience 
(JU*), for only the Prophet has immediate experience of 
this station.’ There is nothing, however, to prevent any- 
one from aspiring to it, although it is unattainable. 

9. ‘ H&jir,’ referring to the obstacle which makes immediate 
experience of this station impossible for us. 

10. ‘Their fire will be clearly seen,’ i.e. the perils into 
which they plunged before they could arrive at these abodes. 
According to the Tradition, ‘ Paradise is encompassed with 
hateful actions/ 

One of the illuminati ( told me at al-Mawsil that 
he had seen in a dream Ma‘ruf al-Karkhi sitting in the midst 
of Hell-fire. The dream terrified him and he did not perceive 
its meaning. I said to him, ‘ That fire is the enclosure that 
guards the abode in which you saw him seated. Let any- 
one who desires to reach that abode plunge into the fire/ 
My friend was pleased with this explanation and recognized 
that it was true. 

11. ‘Let not its lions affright thee/ i.e. if thou art a true 
lover be not dismayed by the dangers confronting thee. ‘ In 
the form of cubs,’ i.e. innocuous and of no account. 

XIX 

1. 0 mouldering remains (of the encampment) at al-Uthayl„ 

where I played with friendly maidens ! 

2. Yesterday it was cheerful and smiling, but to-day it has 

become desolate and frowning. 

3. They went far away and I was unaware of them, and they 

knew not that my mind was watching over them,

4. Following them wherever they journeyed and pitched 

tents, and sometimes it was managing the beasts of 
burden, 

5. Until, when they alighted in a barren wilderness and 

pitched tents and spread the carpets, 

6. It brought them back to a meadow verdant and ripe 

which erstwhile had been an arid desert. 

7. They did not halt at any place but its meadow contained 

forms beautiful as peacocks, 

8. And they did not depart from any place but its earth 

contained tombs of their lovers. 

Commentary 

1. 4 Al-Uthayl,’ i.e. the natural constitution. Its remains 

are described as 4 mouldering ’ because they are changed by 
the various spiritual emotions which pass over them. 

4 Friendly maidens,’ i.e. forms of Divine wisdom by which 
the gnostic’s heart is gladdened. 

2. 4 Desolate and frowning,’ because he has returned to the 
world of sense and consciousness. 

.. 3. ‘And they knew not,’ etc.: as, when a man leaves 
a place, he remains there in imagination and keeps the 
picture of it in his soul. 

4. 4 It was managing the beasts of burden,’ i.e. he was 
influencing them by his thought, so that their thoughts 
turned to him. This was the result of his sincerity ; for 
the inferior, if he turn sincerely to God, may influence the 
superior, as often happens with sincere novices and their 
spiritual directors. 

5. 4 In a barren wilderness,’ i.e. the station of absolute and 
abstract unification. 

4 And spread the carpets,’ in reference to the Divine favours 
which they received on reaching the abode of the Truth. 

6. In this verse he points out that no reality except the 
Divine substance can subsist together with abstract unification. 
Hence, when they gained this station and realized it and 
knew the meaning of God’s word, 4 There is nothing like unto 



86 


THE TAKJUMAN AL-ASHWAQ (XIX, XX) 


Him / He brought them back to the unification of their own 
essences in respect of their oneness, which is incomparable 
in respect of the Divine substance contained in its essence. 

‘To a meadow verdant and ripe/ referring to the Divine 
mysteries which the Truth conveyed to them by the realities 
of the Names. 

7. ‘ Forms beautiful as peacocks/ i.e. their lovely spiritual 
states, actions, and dispositions. 

8. ‘Tombs of their lovers/ i.e. the realities which desire 
that their traces should be manifested in gnostics. These 
objects of knowledge only exist through those who know 
them, and therefore they love the existence of the gnostic, in 
so far as he knows them, more intensely than they are 
desired by him. Accordingly the author describes them as 
dying when the gnostics depart. 

XX 

1. My lovesickness is from her of the lovesick eyelids : 

console me by the mention of her, console me ! 

2. The grey doves fluttered in the meadows and wailed : the 

grief of these doves is from that which grieved me. 

• 

3. May my father be the ransom of a tender playful girl, 

one of the maidens guarded in howdahs, advancing 
swayingly among the married women ! 

4. She rose, plain to see, like a sun, and when she vanished 

she shone in the horizon of my heart. 

5. O ruined abodes at R&rna ! How many fair damsels with 

swelling breasts have they beheld ! 

6. May my father and I myself be the ransom of a God- 

nurtured gazelle which pastures between my ribs in 
safety ! 

7. The fire thereof in that place is light: thus is the light 

the quencher of the fires. 

8. 0 my two friends, bend my reins aside that I may see the 

form of her abode with clear vision. 

9. And when ye reach the abode, descend, and there, my two 

companions, weep for me, 



THE TARJUMAN AL-ASHWAQ (XX) 87 

10. And stop with me a little while at the ruins, that we 

may endeavour to weep, nay, that I may weep indeed 
because of that which befell me. 

11. Passion shoots me without arrows, passion slays me 

without a spear. 

12. Tell me, will ye weep with me when I weep beside her ? 

Help me, oh help me to weep ! 

13. And rehearse to me the tale of Hind and LubnA and 

Sulayma and Zaynab and ‘In&n ! 

14. Then tell me further of Il&jir and Zarud, give me news 

of the pastures of the gazelles ! 

15. And mourn for me with the poetry of Qays and Lubnd, 

and with Mayya and the afflicted Ghayl&n ! 

16. Long have I yearned for a tender maiden, endowed with 

prose and verse, having a pulpit, eloquent, 

17. One of the princesses from the land of Persia, from the 

most glorious of cities, from Isfahan. 

18. She is the daughter of Tr&q, the daughter of my Im&m, 

and I am her opposite, a child of Yemen. 

19. O my lords, have ye seen or heard that two opposites 

are ever united ? 

*20. Had you seen us at Rama proffering each other cups of 
passion without fingers, 

21. Whilst passion caused sweet and joyous words to be 

uttered between us without a tongue, 

22. You would have seen a state in which the under- 

standing disappears — Yemen and ‘Ir&q embracing 
together. 

23. Falsely spoke the poet 1 who said before my time 

(and he has pelted me with the stones of his under- 
standing), 

24. *0 thou who givest the Pleiades in marriage to Suhayl, 

God bless thee ! how should they meet ? 

25. The Pleiades are in the north whenever they rise, and 

Suhayl whenever he rises is in the south.'

THE TARJUMAtf AL-ASHWAQ (XX) 


Commentary 

1. ' Her of the lovesick eyelids ’ : he means the Presence 
desired by gnostics. Although she is too sublime to be 
known and loved, she inclines towards them in mercy 
and kindness and descends into their hearts by a sort of 
manifestation. 

' Console me by the mention of her ’ : there is no cure for 
his malady but remembrance (^j). He says 'Console me’ 
twice, i.e. by my remembrance of God and by God’s 
remembrance of me (cf. Kor. ii, 147). 

2. ‘ The grey doves/ i.e. the spirits of the intermediate 
world. 


' And wailed/ because their souls cannot join the spirits 
which have been released from imprisonment in this 
earthly body. 

3. ‘ A tender playful girl,’ i.e. a form of Divine wisdom, 
essential and holy, which fills the heart with joy. 

' One of the maidens guarded in howdahs ’ : she is a virgin, 
because none has ever known her before ; she was veiled in 
modesty and jealousy during all her journey from the Divine 
Presence to the heart of this gnostic. 

‘ The married women/ i.e. the forms of Divine wisdom 
already realized by gnostics who preceded him. 

4. ‘ And when she vanished,’ etc., i.e. when she set in the 


world of evidence ^JU) she rose in the world of the 

Unseen 

5. ‘ 0 ruined abodes/ i.e. the bodily faculties. 

‘ At RAma/ from A. (he sought), implying that their 
search is vain. 


‘ How many fair damsels,’ etc., i.e. subtle and Divine forms 
by which the bodily faculties were annihilated. 

7. The natural fires are extinguished by the heavenly light 
in his heart. 

8. * The form of her abode/ i.e. the Presence from which 
she issued forth. He seems to desire the station of Divine 
contemplation, since wisdom is not desired except for the 
sake of that to which it leads, 



THE TARJUMAN AL-ASHWAQ (XX) 


89 


9. ‘ Weep for me/ because this Presence annihilates every- 
one who attains unto her and beholds her. 

10. ‘ That I may weep/ etc., i.e. for the loss of the loved 
ones and of everything except the ruins of their abode. 

11. ‘ Without arrows/ i.e. from a distance. He refers to 


the state called JjjL . 

‘ Without a spear/ i.e. near at hand. He refers to the state 
called jLxlU 

13. Hind was the mistress of Bishr, and Lubn& of Qays 
b. al-Dharih ; Tnan was a slave-girl belonging to an-N&tifi ; 
Zaynab was one of the mistresses of ‘Umar b. Abi Rabi'a ; 
Sulayma was a slave-girl whom the author had seen : he 
says that she had a lover. He interprets the names of all 
these women mystically, e.g. Hind is explained as an allusion 
to the Fall of Adam, and Zaynab as signifying removal from 
the station of saintship to that of prophecy. 

16. He describes this essential knowledge ZijX+W) 

as endowed with prose and verse, i.e. absolute in respect of 
her essence, but limited in respect of possession 

• ‘ A pulpit/ i.e. the ladder of the Most Beautiful Names. 
To climb this ladder is to be invested with the qualities of 
these Names. 

‘ Eloquent/ referring to the station of Apostleship. 

The author adds : ‘ I allude enigmatically to the various 
kinds of mystical knowledge which are under the veil of 
an-Niz&m, the maiden daughter of our Shaykh/ 

17. c One of the princesses/ on account of her asceticism, 
for ascetics are the kings of the earth. 

18. ‘ ‘Ir&q ’ indicates origin, i.e. this knowledge comes of 
-a noble race. 

‘ A child of Yemen/ i.e. in respect of faith (^Uj/) and 


wisdom and the breath of the Merciful (^^1 and 

tenderness of heart. These qualities are the opposite of 
what is attributed to Tr&q, viz. rudeness and severity and 
infidelity, whereas the opposite of TrAq itself is not Yemen, 



90 


THE TARJUMAN AL-ASHWAQ (XX, XXl) 


but the Maghrib, and the opposite of Yemen itself is not 
‘Ir&q, but Syria. The antithesis here is between the qualities 
of the Beloved and those of the lover. 

19. ‘Two opposites/ referring to the story of Junayd, 
when a man sneezed in his presence and said, ‘ Ood be 
praised /’ (Kor. i, 1). Junayd said, completing the verse, 
‘ Who is the Lord of created beings' The man replied, ‘ And 
who is the created being, that lie should be mentioned in the 
same breath with God V ‘ O my brother,’ said Junayd, ‘ the 
phenomenal, when it is joined to the Eternal, vanishes and 
leaves no trace behind. When He is there, thou art not, and 
if thou art there, He is not.’ 

22. ‘ Yemen and ‘Iraq/ etc., i.e. the identification of 

the qualities of Wrath and Mercy. He refers to the saying 
of Abii Sa‘id al-Kharraz, who on being asked how he knew 
God, answered, ‘ By His uniting two opposites, for He is the 
First and the Last and the Outward and the Inward 9 
(Kor. 1 vii, 3). 

24. ‘ The Pleiades/ i.e. the seven attributes demonstrated 
by scholastic philosophers. 

‘ Suhayl/ i.e. the Divine Essence. 

25. ‘ In the north/ i.e. in the world of phenomena. The 
Divine attributes are manifested in Creation, but the Divine 
Essence does not enter into Creation.

established usage, just as i, oV 3 (for J) is a violation of grammar.

who inhabit W&di ’l-'Aqiq,

would have been my answer to him.

garment and my passion is my morning drink and my 
tears are my evening drink.’ 


Commentary 

1. He describes pilgrims on the way to the Truth, travelling 
in themselves through the night of their bodily existence and 
stopping for rest at dawn, i.e. the boundary which divides 
the wisdom appertaining to the Divine realities that is 
deposited in the phenomenal world from the realities of the 
Spirits of Light, which are called allegorically the Heavenly 

Host 1*11). The travellers cause their camels, i.e. their 

aspirations, to halt in the Wddi ’l-‘Aqiq, where pilgrims put 
on the garb of pilgrimage (^^1). This is the station of 

Muhammadan sanctity 

2. ‘A cairn,’ i.e. a guide, namely, the spirit. 

‘ A mountain peak,’ i.e. the body.

spirits to the Heavenly Host. 

4 The annql which lays its eggs in the loftiest and most 
inaccessible places. 

* 4. 4 Ornaments/ i.e. the manifestation of the Divine 
qualities. In Bodl. (Uri) 1276, the commentary states that 
al-‘Aquq is said to be a great castle on the top of a high 
mountain. 

7. 4 And whose home/ etc., i.e. this station, notwithstanding 
its sublimity, is veiled by various sorts of revealed knowledge, 
belonging to the class of love, from this person who abides 
there, so that he is caused to pass away from the contemplation 
of himself in this centre of manifestation. 

9. ‘The waters of the well/ i.e. the life acquired from good 

works, viz. the life of knowledge S’L*-), * n reference to

succeeds the Divine descent into the terrestrial heaven, which 
descent occurs in the last third of the night. 

12. ‘A bright-faced lissome damsel/ i.e. the Essential 
attribute which is his object of desire. She is called

nothing is derived that can be grasped by knowledge or 
understanding or imagination. 

‘ Diffusing a perfume/ etc., i.e. leaving Divine impressions

XXIV 

The author says : A dervish recited to me the following 
verse, to which I knew not any brother — 

* Everyone who hopes for thy bounty receives copious 
showers thereof ; thy lightning never breaks its promise of 
rain except with me.’ 

I admired its application and pursued its meaning, and 
I composed some verses in the same rhyme, including this 
verse among them on account of its perfection, and I said in 
answer to that dervish (may God have mercy on him ! ) as 
follows : — 

1. Halt by the ruined abodes at La‘la‘ and mourn for our 

loved ones in that wilderness. 

2. Halt by thy dwelling-places and call to them, wondering 

at their loneliness, with exquisite lamentation. 

3. ‘ Beside thy bdn tree I have seen many a one like myself 

plucking the fruit of comely forms and the roses of 
a verdant meadow. 

4. Everyone who hopes for thy bounty receives copious 

showers thereof ; thy lightning never breaks its 
promise of rain except with me.’ 

5. She said, ‘ Yes ; there hath been that meeting in the 

shadow of my boughs in the most plenteous spot, 

6. When my lightning was one of the lightnings of smiling 

mouths ; but to-day my lightning is the flash of this 
brilliant stone. 

7. Reproach, then, a fate which we had no means of averting : 

what is the fault of the camping-place at Lada* ? ' 

8. I excused her when I heard her speech and how she was 

complaining even as I complain with a sorrowful heart*

9. And I asked her, when I saw her demesne, through which 
the four winds sweep at night, 

10. 4 Did their winds tell thee where they rested at noontide ? ’ 

She said, 4 Yes ; they rested at Dh&t al-Ajra 4 , 

11. Where the white tents are radiant with those rising suns 

within/ 

Commentary 

I. 4 The ruined abodes/ i.e. the vestiges of the dwelling- 
places of the Divine Names in the hearts of gnostics. 

4 In that wilderness/ i.e. in his empty heart. 

3. 4 Plucking the fruit of comely forms/ i.e. the manifold 

knowledge of the Divine Self -subsistence with 

which, according to our doctrine, it is possible to be invested. 
This investiture (^Josr) is a matter of dispute amongst the 
Sufis ; Ibn Junayd al-Ifriqi and his followers consider that it 
is not correct. 

4 The roses of a verdant meadow/ referring to the station 
of Shame (Ush), which results from meditation and con- 
templation. 

4. 4 Thy lightning never breaks its promise/ etc., i.e. through 

the lack of Divine favour (&U*)1 He also indicates 

that he himself is in a lofty station which was not reached 
by any of his peers, because the lightning is a locus of 
manifestation for the Essence, and from this locus the soul of 
the seer gains no knowledge, inasmuch as it is a manifestation 
devoid of material form. 

6. 4 When my lightning/ etc., i.e. that manifestation took 
place in a lovely form, but my manifestation to thee is 
formless and inanimate (<&jUs>-) and is not determined hy 
love and passion. 

II. 4 The white tents/ in reference to the veils of light 
which are drawn over the splendours of the face of God.

green is the bough, how bright the moon, how sweet 
the musk ! 

4. 0 smiling mouth whose bubbles I loved ! and 0 saliva in

and on this account she veiled herself. 

7. She is the morning sun rising in a heaven, she is the 

bough of the sand-hills planted in a garden. 

8. Fear made me watch her incessantly while I watered the

deliver to us of your perfume, by means of the 
zephyr,

the flowers of thy lowlands or the flowers of the hills.

that can be compared with her tenderness ! 

17. The zephyr’s breeze tells of the time of youth spent at 

Hrijir or Mind or Qubd, 

18. Or at the sand-hills and where the vale bends beside the 

guarded pasture or at Lada 4 , where the gazelles come 
to browse.

20. Who, whenever a turtle-dove moans, is thrilled by the 
remembrance of his beloved and passes away. 

Commentary 

1. ‘O grief for my heart’: he fears that the anguish of 
love will destroy this body by the mediation of which he has 
acquired the Divine sciences. Although most souls desire to 
be stripped thereof and to return to their elemental world, 
yet in the opinion of profound theosophists abstraction from 
the body should only be sought through ecstasy and self- 
annihilation (Miij ‘i’lp-), not by dissolving the connexion of 
body and soul. 

‘ O joy for my mind,’ because the mind is the locus in 
which the Truth is contemplated. 

2. 4 The full moon of darkness hath set ’ : in reference to 
the Tradition, 4 Ye shall see your Lord as ye see the moon on 
the night when she is full.’ 

4 Darkness,’ i.e. the invisible world. He describes the moon 
as having set in the sensible world and risen in his mind. 

3. 4 O musk,’ i.e. breathing Divine mercy. 

4 O full moon,’ because her light is borrowed from the Light 
bf God, and because she is a mirror for Him who manifests 
Himself in her. 

4 0 bough of the sand-hills,’ referring to the quality of 
Self-subsistence 

4 How green is the bough ! ’ i.e. clothed with Divine Names. 

4. 4 Bubbles ’ : as water is the source of all life, the bubbles 
signify the sciences of Divine mercy which appear from the 
Divine Life when the breaths (of mercy) flow. 

4 Saliva,’ i.e. sciences of communion and converse and speech 
which leave a delicious taste in the heart. 

5. God is described as bashful in an Apostolic 

Tradition. 

6. 4 Had she removed her veil,’ etc. : according to the 
Tradition, 4 God hath seventy thousand veils of light and 
darkness ; if He were to remove them, the splendours of His 
face would consume all that His sight perceives.’ Therefore 



100 THE TARJUMAN AL-ASHWAQ (XXV) 

He keeps Himself veiled in mercy to us, in order that our 
substance may survive, for in the survival of the substance of 
phenomenal being the Divine Presence and its lovely Names 
are manifested, and this is the beauty of phenomenal being ; 
if it perished, thou wouldst not know, since all kinds of 
knowledge are divulged by means of forms and bodies. 

7. ‘In a heaven/ referring to the form in which the 
manifestation takes place. The form varies according to the 
variety of beliefs and cognitions ; and this is what is called 

‘ transformation ’ (jyA\ ^ JI-oM). Some gnostics, 

e.g. Qadib al-B&n, attain to this station in a sensible form. 
Its spiritual form comprises all the mystical states of 

mankind. 

‘ The bough of the sand-hills/ the quality of Self-subsistence 
in the garden of the Divine Names. 

‘ Planted ’ refers to the investiture with this quality, 

a doctrine which is contrary to that of Ibn Junayd and others. 
We agree, however, as to its realization Qjls?), although I 
deny the possibility of realizing anything which cannot be 
an object of such investiture, since it is not to be apprehended 
by feeling ( : it may be known symbolically, but not 

emotionally. 

8. 4 Fear made me watch her/ i.e. in fear of being veiled 
from her I began to behold her in everything and before 
everything, regarding everything as depending on her and 
immanent (in God) before its creation. 

4 1 watered the bough/ in order that the Divine sciences 
which it contains might bear fruit in me. 

9. ‘ She will be a wonder/ for it is wonderful that Man in 
his abasement should apprehend God in His glory. 

10. ‘Beauty/ i.e. a loons of ocular manifestation in the 

station of severance (£yh!l), in which Man is discriminated 
from God. 

4 Un wrought gold/ referring to her freedom from contac- 
with phenomena. 

‘Gold that has been wrought * : gold denotes the quality

of perfection which is attained by completing the series 
of stations. It is described as wrought, because God’s 
manifestation to us by means of ourselves is actual, whereas 
His manifestation to us by means of Himself is not. 

12. Idris typifies the speculative theologian. 

13. ‘ Her couch,’ i.e. her lofty degree. 

‘ Her mind ’ : b for Jb (mind), because u (*L), the second 
letter of the alphabet, signifies Universal Reason, which is the 
second category of Being. 

15. 'From the flowers of thy lowlands,’ i.e. the station of 

Divine Revelation (^&S which descends in the Sunna 

of the Apostle and in the revealed scriptures. 

‘ The flowers of the hills,’ i.e. the most inaccessible veil of 
the Divine glory. 

16. Man seeks God in want and in desire to receive, 
whereas God seeks Man in wealth and in desire to give. 

17. ‘ The zephyr’s breeze,’ etc., i.e. the sciences wafted into 
the heart from the revelation and manifestation of God in 
diverse stations. 

18. 'At the sand-hills,’ i.e. the mount of Vision. 

‘ Where the vale bends,’ i.e. the station of Mercy, which 
allows the human essence to subsist ' beside the guarded 
pasture ’, i.e. at the manifestation of the Divine essence. 

‘ At La'laV i.e. in the frenzy of love. 

19. Do not wonder at a thing which yearns for its 
original home. 

20. ‘ A turtle-dove,’ i.e. the soul of a gnostic like himself, 
whose sublime utterance excites in him a longing for God.

i.e. in the place where Divine favours are bestowed on the

mankind. 

‘ The journey’s end,’ i.e. the mystery of everlasting life. 

2. ‘ Do not seek,’ etc., in accordance with the Tradition, 
There is no mark beyond God.' 

3. ‘ And play,' etc., referring to the various states of this 
gnostic in which he is transported from one Divine Name to 
another. ‘ Full-breasted damsels ' and ‘ shy gazelles ' refer to 
the abstruse sciences of pure unification. 

4. ‘In a meadow,' i.e. the Divine Presence, together with 
the Holy Names contained in it. 

‘ Flies,’ i.e. subtle spirits. 

‘ A warbling bird,' i.e. the human soul, in respect of the

‘ There hath risen for you/ etc., i.e. the light in the heart

source and convey to the members of the body the Divine 
realities. In this station a man sees by God, hears by God, 
speaks by God, and moves by God. 

2. ‘ The deserts which I crossed/ i.e. the mortifications and 
austerities which I suffered. 

4. ‘ The camels/ i.e. the aspirations. He means that they 
do not cease from seeking, although exhausted by the

the proofs supplied by the understanding are unable to 
lead them to the Divine reality.

God, while complaining of distress and fatigue, yet these

22. The East Wind did not tell the truth when it brought 

cheating phantoms. 

23. Sometimes the wind deceives when it causes thee to hear 

what is not (really) heard. 

Commentary 

. 1. 4 Between al-Naqd and La‘la‘/ etc., i.e. between the 
hill of white musk, on which is the vision of God, and the 
place of frenzied love for Him, are diverse sorts of knowledge 
connected with the stations of abstraction 

2. ‘ In a dense covert of tangled shrubs/ i.e. the world of 
phenomenal admixture and interdependence. 

3. ‘ New moons,’ i.e. Divine manifestations. 

4. ‘From fear/ i.e. from fear that the beholder might 
pass away in himself from himself, and that his essence 
might perish, whereas his object is to continue subsistent 
through God and for God ; or from fear that he should 
imagine the manifestation to be according to the essentia] 
nature of God in Himself (which is impossible), and not 
according to the nature of the recipient. The former belief, 
which involves the comprehension (aiU*!) of God by the 
person to whom the manifestation is made, agrees with the 



106 


THE TARJUMAN AL-ASHWAQ (XXVIIl) 


doctrine of some speculative theologians, who maintain that 
our knowledge of God and Gabriel's knowledge of Him 
and His knowledge of Himself are the same. How far is 
this from the truth ! 

5. ‘ A flash from the lightning of that fire-stone/ i.e. an 
inanimate, phenomenal, and earthly manifestation. 

9. ‘ O camel-driver/ i.e. the voice of God calling the 
aspirations to Himself.

the tears which he shed in anticipation of parting.

of mercy and tenderness. 

‘ My death-bed, 5 because the Divine mercy causes him to 
pass away in bewilderment. 

13. ‘Beside the waters of al-Ajra‘ 5 : because this mercy 
is the result of painful self-mortification (ui \\ 

14. ‘ One dismissed, 5 i.e one who has come to himself 
again after contemplation, according to the tradition that 
God says, after having shown Himself to His servants in 
Paradise, ‘ Send them back to their pavilions. 5 * 

16. ‘A darkness, 5 i.e. the forms in which the manifesta- 
tion takes place. 

‘ Take from him something, 5 etc., i.e. take from him what- 
ever is related to himself, and leave whatever is not related 
to himself, so that only the Divine Spirit may remain in him.

of attaining the reality of that which I seek, and I grieve 
for the time spent in a vain search for it. 

‘As though I were fixed in my place, 5 i.e. I cannot 
escape from my present state, inasmuch as it is without 
place, quantity, and quality, being purely transcendental

which God, who has no like, is presented to us by the 
world of breaths JL).

and fro as they bend, bending their tresses towards 
the cheeks !

of a slender girl who bestowed on me favours and 
bounties ! 

14. She established the harmony of union, for she is our 

principle of harmony : she is both Arab and foreign ; 
she makes the gnostic forget.

swords, and her front teeth show to thee a dazzling 
levin.

I have plunged into places of destruction and death,

camel which complains of her worn hoofs and of 
deserts and wildernesses, 

19. A camel whose flanks are lean and whose rapid journeying 

caused her to lose her strength and the fat of her 
hump, 

20. Until I brought her to a halt in the sandy tract of 

H&jir and saw she -camels followed by young ones 
at al-Uthayl. 

21. They were led by a moon of awful mien, and I clasped 

him to my ribs for fear that he should depart,

while he circumambulated me I was not circum- 
ambulating anyone except him. 

23. He was effacing his footprints with the train of his robe, 

so that thou wouldst be bewildered even if thou wert 
the guide tracing out his track.

diverse beautiful shapes.

derived from another. 

‘ New gifts,* i.e. knowledge of which the proof is bestowed 
by God and occurs to one’s own mind as the result of sound 
reflection. -

‘New moons/ i.e. a manifestation in the horizon J®?). 

‘ Which suffer no eclipse/ i.e. they are not subject to any 
natural lust that veils them from the Divine Ideas. 

13. ‘ A slender girl/ i.e. the single, subtle, and essential 
knowledge of God. 

14. ‘ She established the harmony of union/ i.e. this 
knowledge concentrated me upon myself and united me 
with my Lord. 

‘ Arab/ i.e. it caused me to know myself from myself. 

‘ Foreign/ i.e. it caused me to know myself from God, 
because the Divine knowledge is synthetic and does 

not admit of analysis except by means of comparison ; and 
since comparison is impossible, therefore analysis is impossible ; 
whence it follows that synthesis also is impossible, and I only 
use the latter term in order to convey to the reader’s 
intelligence a meaning that is not to be apprehended save 
by immediate feeling and intuition.

connected with many aspects of plurality which disappeared

3. 0 my two friends, stop and beg speech of the relics of an 

abode which has become ruined after them, 

4. And mourn for the heart of a youth who left it on the 

day when they departed, and weep and wail. 

5. Perchance it may tell whither they were bound, to the 

sands of the guarded pasture or to Qubd. 

-6. They saddled the camels and I knew not whether ’twas

8. 0 thoughts that fled and dispersed in pursuit of them like 

the bands of Sabd ! 

9. I hailed every wind that blows, crying, 4 0 North wind ! 

0 South wind ! 0 East wind ! 

10. Have ye any knowledge of what I feel ? Anguish hath 

befallen me on account of their departure/ 

11. The East wind gave me its news delivered by the skill 

plants whicli received it from the hill-flowers, 

12. Saying, 4 Whosoever is sick of the malady of passion, let 

him be diverted by the tales of love.’ 

13. Then it said, 4 O North wind, tell him the like of what 

1 have told him, or something more wonderful. 

14. Then do thou, 0 South wind, relate the like of what 

I have related to him or something more sweet.’ 

15. The North wind said, 4 1 have a joy which the North 

wind shares with the South wind : 

16. Every evil is good in the passion which they inspire, and 

my torment is sweetened by their approval.’ 

17. To what end, therefore, and on what ground and for what 

cause dost thou complain of the sorrow and sickness ? 

18. And when they promise you aught, you see that its 

lightning gives a false promise of rain. 

19. The Invisible fashioned on the sleeve of the cloud 

a golden embroidery of the lightning’s splendour, 

20. And its tears poured from it upon the middle of its 

cheek-balls and kindled a fierce flame. 

21. She is a rose that springs up from tears, a narcissus that 

sheds a marvellous shower. 

22. And when thou wouldst fain gather her, she lets down, 

to conceal herself, a scorpion-like tress on each side 
of her temples. 

23. The sun rises when she smiles. 0 Lord, how bright are 

these bubbles on her teeth ! 

24. Night appears when she lets fall her black, luxuriant, 

and tangled hair. 

25. The bees compete with one another whenever she spits. 

0 Lord, how sweet is that coolness !

26. And whenever she bends she shows to us a (fruitful) 

branch, or when she gazes her looks are drawn 
swords. 

27. How long wilt thou talk amorously at the sand-hill of 

Hdjir, 0 son of al-'Arabf, to the coy beauties ? 

28. Am not I an Arab ? and therefore I love the fair women 

and am fond of the coy beauties. 

29. I care not whether my passion rises with me or sets, 

if only she be there. 

30. Whenever I say 'Will ye not?' they say, 'Wilt not thou?’ 

and whenever I say, ' May not I ? * they say, ' He 
refuses/ 

31. And whenever they go to the upland or to the lowland, 

I cross the desert in haste to search for them. 

32. My heart is the Samiri of the time : as often as it sees 

the footprints it seeks the golden one that was turned 
to gold. 

33. And whenever they rise or set, it goes like Dhu ’1-Qarnayn 

in quest of the means (of reaching them). 

34. How oft did we cry out in hope of union ! How oft did 

we cry out in fear of parting ! 

36. 0 sons of az-Zawra, this is a moon that appeared among 
you and set in me. 

36. By God, it is the source of my grief. How often do 

I exclaim behind it, ' Alas ! ’ 

37. Woe is me, woe is me for a youth who, whenever a dove 

warbles, is made to vanish !

5. ‘ The sands of the guarded pasture/ referring to the 

endurance of anguish ^Jk?) caused by separation in 

a station remote from phenomenal being and inaccessible. 

‘ Qub&/ i.e. the station of repose, for the Prophet used to 
alight there every Sabbath. 

6. ‘ The camels/ i.e. the aspirations on which our hearts ride. 

7. ‘’Twas only a frenzy of love/ etc., i.e. my preoccupation 
with love for Him veiled me from Himself. 

13-14. The East wind bestows on him the knowledge of 
‘ God created Adam after His own image ’, the South wind 
bestows on him the knowledge of the companions of the 

right hand Kor. lvi, 89), and the North wind 

bestows on him the knowledge of the favourites of God 

Kor. lvi, 87), which is the station between prophecy 

and saintship and is attained only by the nonpareils (jl^iM), 
of whom al-Khadir is one, as the Koran bears witness. 
Abu Hrimid (al-Ghazali) denies the existence of this station, 
because he never reached or knew it, and he imagines that 
those Saints who advance beyond the rank of the siddiqs 
have fallen into prophecy and have acted irreverently, but 
such is not the case. The station to which I refer lies between 
the position of the siddiq and that of the Prophet. It is 
indicated by the mystery which made an impression on the 

heart of the greatest siddiq , Abti Bakr (Jij ^j\ 

16. When the lover passes away from his own desire, 
every evil becomes good to him, because it is the will and 
desire of his Beloved. 

18. ‘Its lightning gives a false promise of rain’: a 
manifestation of the Essence produces nothing in the heart, 
inasmuch as it cannot be apprehended or confined by any 
phenomenal object. In this respect it differs from the 
manifestation in forms in the world of similitudes, for the 
seer apprehends the form of that which is manifested to him 
and interprets it. 

19. ‘ On the sleeve of the cloud/ referring to Kor. ii, 206. 



114 


THE TAHJUMAN AL-ASHWAQ (XXX) 


The cloud is the heart which clothes, i.e. contains, God. The 
sleeve represents the hand which takes the pledge of fealty 
to Him. The author describes a manifestation of the Essence 
behind the veil of phenomena, a manifestation due to the fact 
profoundly realized by a servant of God, that God created 
Adam in His image. 

20. ‘And its tears/ etc., i.e. diverse sorts of evidentiary 
knowledge poured into the gardens of the Divine hearts and 
produced an overwhelming sense of awe and majesty. 

21. ‘ A narcissus/ i.e. a vision that imparts incomprehensible 
knowledge. 

23. ‘ The sun rises/ i.e. sciences appear which are connected 
with the Qutb and upon which the universe depends. 

24. She reveals to the hearts of gnostics mysterious love. 

25. When this gnostic feels in himself a Divine realization 
so that he attains to the station indicated in the Tradition, 

‘ I am his ear and his eye/ his speech becomes pure Truth 
and absolute Revelation, and the hearts of his disciples 
receive from him knowledge in the same way as the bees 
receive honey from God (Kor. xvi, 70). 

26. As the winds sway the bough, so the gnostic’s aspiration 
causes God to incline mercifully towards him. 

27. ‘At the sand-hill of Htijir/ i.e. the white hill, well- 
known to the Stiffs, on which it is impossible for anyone 
to set foot. He says, ‘ Why dost thou not occupy thyself 
with making ready for the gifts bestowed by this high 
station, in order that no thought of “the coy beauties”, 
i.e. contemplation and bewilderment, may occur to thee ? ’ 

28. He answers : ‘ The beauties which I seek are the 
offspring of the original fiat whence we came forth. I am 
an Arab c) and therefore I love the coy beauties (c-jptil), 
i.e. do not blame me for acting as I am prompted by what in 
me is original and real.’ 

29. ‘ I care not/ etc., i.e. I am not limited by stations 
and degrees, but only by her, so that wherever she is I am. 

30. When I say to the mediums and veils, ‘ Will you not 
consider my case with her, that perchance I may win of

115 


her such delight as other ecstatics have enjoyed ? ’ they 
answer: 'Wilt not thou consider our faces how they are 
turned towards thee and veiled from her ? ’ i.e. secondary 
causes are merely an affliction and probation through which 
you must pass, but if you remain with them you will receive 
nothing except what their being can give, and you will 
be veiled from the object of your desire. 

' May not I ? ’ i.e. may not I attain to my Beloved ? 

' He refuses/ i.e. he excludes those who seek him by 
means of secondary causes. God is known only by means 
of God. The scholastic theologian says : ' I know God by 
that which He created/ and takes as his guide something 
that has no real relation to the object sought. He who 
knows God by means of phenomena, knows as much as 
those phenomena give to him and no more. 

31. 'They go to the upland/ i.e. the Divine realities 
reveal themselves in imaginary bodies as Gabriel appeared 
in the form of Diliya. 

'To the lowland,’ i.e. they reveal themselves, like the 
spirits of the prophets, in earthly bodies of the intermediate 
world. 

32. 'As. often as it sees the footprints/ etc.: cf. 
Kor. xx, 96. He says : ' There is in me an aspiration with 
which I revive those whom I regard with favour, and those 
whose growth is symmetrical, and those whose form is erect 
(I mean in the earthly pilgrimage), and those whose hearts 
are prepared to receive the overflowing grace of the spirit ; 
and I breathe into them something of that which I have 
gained from that footprint, and they are revived thereby 
and are under my care/ He refers to the class of saints 

who have renounced the powers of 'control’ ^^11) 
which God bestowed upon them, for one who abides with 
the Primal Bealities is more perfect in knowledge than one 
who is veiled by such Divine gifts. Ab\i Yazid (al-Bistdmf) 
said : ' It is not I whom they are touching, but it is a robe 
in which God clothed me : how, then, should I hinder them 
from that which belongs to another ? ’ Whoever sees the 



116 


THE TARJUMAN AL-ASHWAQ (XXX, XXXl) 


robe of honour which God conferred on the Black Stone, 
and knows the stone, will know what I mean. This was 
the station of Abu Yazid and of my Shaykh, Abii Madyan. 

34. How often did we beg for power over the spiritual 
states, so that we might rule them without fear of losing 
them ! 

35. ‘ 0 sons of az-Zawra/ : az-Zawra is a name of Baghdad, 
which is the residence of the Qutb in the visible world. 
The author refers to those who are in the presence of the 
Qutb and under his aegis \j c^ss*). 

‘ A moon/ etc., i.e. an essential manifestation which appeared 
among you through the existence of the Qutb, and vanished 
in me, i.e. it is my inward being and mystery 

He makes himself to be one of the nonpareils 

36. ‘ Behind it/ although it is within himself, indicating 

that it is not circumscribed but that 

it is with him in the category of additionals, as the Prophet 
said, ‘ 0 Lord, let me increase in knowledge/ 

37. ‘ A dove/ i.e. the spirits of the intermediate world, 

the bearers of the inspiration that comes at the tinkling 
sound which is like the noise of a chain when 

it strikes a rock. They cause this heart to vanish, even as 
they themselves vanish on hearing that sound. Hence 
the Prophet said that this manner of inspiration was the 
most grievous to him, and he used to pass away from his 
senses, and wrap himself until it departed, after he had 
understood its meaning. A portion of this belongs to his 
(spiritual) heirs.

5. A woman, slender, lissome, of fresh beauty, for whom 

the heart of the sad lover is longing/ 

6. The assembly is filled with fragrance at the mention 

of her, and every tongue utters her name. 

7. And if her seat were a valley (but her throne is a high

11. My night is radiant with her face, and my day is dark 

with her hair. 

12. The core of my heart, when the Cleaver shot it through 

with her arrows,

the entrails, and none of their shafts misses the 
mark.

15. Is more unlucky than a full-grown camel which they 

saddled, that it might carry away one whose beauty 
is surpassing, 

16. And might leave at Dh&t al-Add a passionate lover 

slain, although in love of them he is true. 

Commentary 

1. ‘ A lightning-cloud/ i.e. a manifestation of the Essence. 
‘Dh&t al-Add/ in Tih&ma, i.e. the station of abasement

themselves before Him.

tions of the Divine Ideas. 

14-16. The most unlucky of all things is any ecstasy 
that intervenes between thee and this Divine attribute, for 
ecstasy takes possession of the heart, so that the mystery

Manifestation is left neglected and without power to retain 
that which has already been revealed to it.

Commentary

the night of phenomenal forms and ‘ gat Him away at dawn',

not allowed to traverse this station. 

11-18. The author says that, in accordance with the real 
relation subsisting between God and His creatures, they 
should be connected with Him, not He with them. Thus the 
supple bough should be compared to the form of the Divine 
Beloved and the rose to His cheeks, not vice versd i as

sacrifice himself for the sake of those whom he loves, and 
then they will praise him. 

4. ‘ An Arab girl/ i.e. one of the Muhammadan kinds of 
knowledge. 

‘ Belonging by origin to the daughters of Persia ’ : for the

unveiled herself to an Arab with no particular motive, he 
used to regard it as a sign that she was unlucky to him, and

others, and dying to himself, so that he remained with her in

Kor. xl, 11 : ‘ Thou hast caused us to die twice / 

8. ‘ Thy foes/ etc., i.e. they will beguile thee with a form 
resembling mine at the moment when I manifest my essence 
to thee, i.e. thy desire to obtain possession of my essence will 
deceive thee and make thee imagine that the form in which 
I appear to thee is I myself. 

9. ‘ I am in a guarded demesne/ etc., as it is said of the 
Prophet : ‘ for He causes a guard {of angels) to go before and 
behind him 9 (Kor. lxxii, 27), that he might be in no doubt 
concerning his inspiration. This is the meaning of my verse, 
‘ At night the angels descended upon my heart and circled it 
like the sphere that circles the pole-star/ 

10. ‘This poem of mine is without rhyme/ i.e. it has 

no recurring rhyme-letter which in a rhymed poem 

would invariably precede the U. 

‘ I intend by it only Her ’ (or, as the author expresses it,

Commentary 

1. ‘ Her of the dyed fingers ’ : he means the phenomenal 
power by which the Eternal power

theologians. He says, ‘ Who will impart to me the truth of 
this matter, so far as knowledge thereof is possible ? ’ He 
wishes to know whether God manifests Himself therein 
( Jas? Jj&) or not. The author denies such mani- 

festation, but some mystics and the Mu‘tazilites allow it, 
while the Siifis among the Ash‘arites leave the question 
undecided.

a kind of mutual influence (, upon one another.

1. Whenever we meet to take farewell thou wouldst deem 

us, as we clasp and embrace, to be a doubled letter. 

2. Although our bodies are dual, the eye sees only a 

single one. 

o 

3. This is because of my leanness and his light, and were it 

not for my moaning, I should have been invisible to 
the eye. 

Commentary 

1-2. The doubled letter is two letters, one of which is 
concealed in the other. The soul, bidding farewell to the 
body, says, ‘ We are in this case, for though we are really 
two, we appear to be one.’ The soul loves the body because 
all her knowledge of God is gained through her imprisonment 
in the body and through her making use of it in order to 
serve God. The author also refers to the verse, ‘ I am he 
whom I love and he whom I love is 1/ 



140 


THE TARJUMAN AL-ASHWAQ (LIII, LTV) 


The mention of ‘ farewell ’ indicates a distinction between 
the qualities which properly belong to the lover and those 
which properly belong to the Beloved.

‘ And his light,’ i.e. on account of the intensity of his light

subtlety.

that I speak to thee, thou wouldst not see me.’

Where should the sun dwell but in heaven ? 

2. When a throne is set up, there must be a king to sit 

erect upon it. 

3. When the heart is purged of its ignorance, then must 

the angel descend. 

4. He made Himself master of me and I of Him, and each 

of us hath possessed the other. 

5. My being His property is evident, and my possessing 

Him is (proved by) His saying, ‘ Come hither.’ 

6. O camel-driver, let us turn aside and do not lead the 

travellers past Dar al-Falak. 

7. A house on a river-bank near al-Musanna caused thee to 

fall sick and did not make thee forget thy sickness. 

8. Would that the lord of desire had laid on thee (O my

Himself fond, oh, would that He had emboldened thee 
to show fondness towards Him ! 

Commentary 

1. 'The suns are in the heavenly sphere/ i.e. the Divine 
radiance is in the heart. 

2. Cf. Kor. xv, 29, and xx, 4. 

3. ' The angel/ i.e. the most sublime spiritual essences.

manifested only in contingent being. 

5. ' Come hither ’ (Kor. xii, 23), i.e. in order that the 
Names may be manifested, which is impossible unless I 
receive them. 

6-7. ' DAr al-Falak/ a convent for pious women at Baghdad 
on the bank of the Tigris near al-Musanna, which is the 
residence of the ImAm — oil whom be peace ! The author 
refers to the heart, because it is the Temple of Divine 
manifestation. 

'Al-Musanna/ the station of the Qutb, since it was the 
Caliph’s palace. 

' To fall sick/ i.e. to fall in love. 

' And did not make thee forget thy sickness/ i.e. gave thee 
no relief. 

9. He says that the passion of his soul was not kindled by 
anything contingent or finite. 

11. He says: 'Although thou hadst knowledge of God, 
that knowledge did not humble thee so much as thou wert 
humbled by the glory of His manifestation, i.e. thy abasement 
was due to His glory, not to Himself ; hence thy knowledge 
of Him was imperfect/ 

LV 

1. I am absent, and desire makes my soul die ; and I meet 

him and am not cured, so ’tis desire whether I am

2. And meeting with him creates in me what I never

imagined; and the remedy is a second disease of 
passion, 

3. Because I behold a form whose beauty, as often as we 

meet, grows in splendour and majesty. 

4. Hence there is no escape from a passion that increases 

in correspondence with every increase in his loveli- 
ness according to a predestined scale. 

Commentary 

1-4. He is continually tormented, for in the anguish of 
absence he hopes to be cured by meeting his Beloved, but the 
meeting only adds to his pain, because he is always moving 
from a lower state to a higher, and the latter inevitably 
produces in him a more intense passion than the former did.

another. 

4. Meseems, Tigris is the string of pearls on her neck, and 

her spouse is our lord, the Imam who guides aright,
